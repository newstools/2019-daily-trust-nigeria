The Federal Government recorded an increase of 8,686.6 megawatts (MW) in power generation in December 2018, as the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) transmitted 125,346.4mw as against 116,659.8mw in November 2018. The daily statistics of TCN operations obtained by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) from the Nigerian Electricity System Operator (SO), a section of the TCN, indicated that 125,346.4mw was generated between Dec. 1 and Dec, 31, 2018. This translates to an increase of 8,686.6mw harvested from the ongoing Nigerian Independent Power Projects (NIPP) to the national grid as against 116,659.8mw generated between Nov. 2 and Nov. 30, 2018. The statistics indicated that power generation increased by 8,686.6mw between November and December 2018. NAN reports that the daily power generated between Dec. 1 and Dec. 15, 2018 stood at: 4,124.8mw, 4,176mw, 4,031.3mw, 4,220mw, 4,295.1mw, 4,396.5mw, 4,190.9mw, 4,276.3mw and 4,078.5mw respectively. Others are: 4,151.3mw, 4,343mw, 4,344.5mw, 3,948.4mw, 4,060.3mw and 4,197.3mw. It also showed that daily power generated from Dec. 16 to Dec. 31, 2018 stood at: 4,034 mw, 3,802.1mw, 4,130mw, 4,126.6mw, 4,331.6mw, 4,971.5mw, 3,950mw and 4,402.2mw respectively. Others were: 4,214.3mw, 4,162mw, 4,039.9mw, 4,176.5mw, 4,015.5mw 4,092mw and 4,064mw. The energy generated was transmitted to 11 distribution companies (Discos). The TCN said the national peak demand forecast stood at 19,100.00mw, while the installed available capacity was 11,165.40mw. The current transmission and network operational capacities are 7,000mw and 5,500.00mw respectively. NAN also reports that the peak generation ever attained in Nigeria is 5,222.3mw, while the maximum energy ever attained stands at 109,372.01mwh.
