The Kwara North All Progressives Youth Forum (APYF) at the weekend accused the state government, the Senate President and PDP leader in the state, Bukola Saraki, of “using strong arm tactics to coerce traditional rulers in the state to vote for PDP in this year’s general elections.” But reacting to the allegation, the Senior Special Assistant to Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed, Dr. Muideen Akorede, said Saraki and the governor held traditional rulers in high esteem as revered leaders of their communities. “At no time, therefore, did Dr. Saraki or Governor Ahmed treat or address their royal highnesses with anything less than the respect, decorum and courtesies that their positions demand and that has always been accorded them. “The allegations are false and are accordingly dismissed as politically motivated antics of the opposition which has embarked on a futile effort to turn the traditional rulers against the political leadership of Dr. Bukola Saraki and the administration of Alhaji Abdulfatah Ahmed,” he said. The Kwara youth forum, however, said the people of Kwara North have vowed not to pitch their political tent with the “Bukola Saraki-led government in the state in the forthcoming elections.” Kwara North comprised of Baruten, Edu, Patigi, Kaiama and Moro local government areas of the state. Addressing journalists in Ilorin, the state capital, spokesman of the forum, Zakari Baba Yusuf, said “the PDP and its leader, Bukola Saraki, having seen clearly that they have lost the next general elections and having run out of campaign strategies, have opted for the crude and cruel method of harassing, abusing, embarrassing and intimidating our traditional rulers to influence the collective decision of the people, particularly the youth who have absolutely resolved to change the status quo.” Youth group alleges Saraki, Kwara govt coercing traditional leaders to vote PDP 2019: Kwara North APC elders forum calls for power shift Traditional rulers back Saraki, Ahmed
