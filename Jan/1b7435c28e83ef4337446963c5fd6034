The Federal Government’s budget of N8.83 trillion for the 2019 fiscal year constitutes only 7 per cent of the N130 trillion projected spending in the Nigerian economy in 2019. This was disclosed by the Director General of the Budget Office of the Federation, Mr. Ben Akabueze, during a roundtable dialogue on the 2019 budget organised by the Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) Policy Advocacy Centre (PAC) held in Abuja, yesterday. The President of ACCI, Prince Adetokumbo Kayode, said the roundtable was convened to interrogate the 2019 budget and also understand the business opportunities in it. Mr. Akabueze said an aggregation of the Federal Government budget, state and local governments budgets would only amount to about N20 trillion and this value is far from the total projected spending in the economy for the year. The budget office boss said the bulk of the spending came from the private sector and that was largely ignored in discussions around spending in the economy. He said while public sector spending is significant in Nigeria, the country’s public sector spending as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which is 10 per cent to 12 per cent, is one of the lowest in Africa estimated averagely at about 22 per cent. “We are not spending nearly half of what we should be spending,” the budget office boss told the participants. He said the 3.8 per cent GDP growth rate projected in the 2019 budget should be the least Nigeria should aspire to attain as any growth less than that would amount to growing below the country’s population growth rate. On business opportunities in the 2019 budget, Mr. Akabueze said the private sector can leverage on the several projects in the capital expenditure component of the budget.
