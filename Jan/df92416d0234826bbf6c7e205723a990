The national chairman of the Providence People’s Congress (PPC), Mr. Benson Adeton,a has said Nigerians should not see other political parties as a burden. He said the two dominant parties – the Peoples Democratic Party and the All Progressives Congress (APC) are but one adding that they are responsible for the woes of the country. In his state of the nation address in Lagos, the PPC chairman flanked by the party’s presidential candidate, Pastor Victor Okhai declared that many Nigerians are tired of the two parties. He said it is high time Nigerians gave other political parties a chance and not see them as a burden. The PPC, one of the nation’s political parties established in 2013, has 30 Senatorial candidates, 70 Reps and 15 governors contesting under its platform, he said. According to the chairman, Nigerians should discern which of the other political parties truly represent the people and would fight for the betterment of the people. He reiterated that Nigeria cannot afford to go through the current harrowing experience it is passing through. He expressed dismay that the love of money has eroded the people’s humanity, adding that Buhari’s government had preoccupied itself with recovering money and in the process abandoned the welfare of the people.
