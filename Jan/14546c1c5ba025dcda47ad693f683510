The newly-appointed acting Inspector General of Police Abubakar Mohammed Adamu has said that he would stick by the rules in piloting the affairs of the police. Speaking after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari alongside his predecessor, Ibrahim Idris, Adamu said he would work hard to address the insecurity challenges facing the country. He told State House reporters:  ” We know that there are security challenges that we need to tackle in the country: issues of kidnapping, abduction and other security challenges. From the strategies put in place by the former IGP, we will restrategize and make sure that we tackle these challenges squarely. “On the elections, you have heard from the former IGP, adequate arrangement has been made to make sure that free and fair and credible elections take place in Nigeria. We are going to build up on the strategies put in place to make sure that we have hitch-free elections in the country. “Well, we are professionals. We are going to stick by the rules, we are going to do the right thing. We will not go outside the ethics of our job to do things that are untoward; everybody will be given level playing ground to play his or her politics.” Idris leaves, hands over to new IGP Adamu Police: Waiting for Abubakar’s Revolution Why I agreed to appear before Senate - IGP
