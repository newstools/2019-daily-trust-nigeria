BUA Group has signed a contract with CBMI, a cement manufacturer for the construction of a 3 million metric tonnes per annum Kalambaina Cement Line 2 in Sokoto State.

This will bring BUA Cement’s total installed capacity to 11 million MTPA on completion. Last week, Bua the listed its shares from the almost $1 billion merger between BUA Kalambaina Cement Company and Cement Company of Northern Nigeria (CCNN) where it also assumed majority stakes in the enlarged company, Speaking at the contract signing ceremony in Sokoto State, Abdul Samad Rabiu, Executive Chairman/CEO, BUA Group and Chairman of CCNN, said the construction of the 3m mtpa Kalambaina line was in line with BUA Cement’s strategic midterm expansion programme. He said the Nigerian market is still greatly underserved and with the projected growth in major infrastructure projects and spending over the next few years, it is important that local manufacturers are able to scale effectively to meet current and projected demand. “We are very confident that Sinoma CBMI possesses the necessary technical expertise given their track records in deploying cement plants across the world,” he said. Mr. Tong Laigou, Chairman of CBMI signed for CBMI Construction Samad added, “We will continue to deliver quality products which has earned us the ‘King of Strength and King of Cement’ moniker amongst block makers who form the largest users of cement in Nigeria.” The recent approval of its merger with CCNN by the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) saw the enlarged CCNN become Nigeria’s 12th largest company by market capitalisation.
