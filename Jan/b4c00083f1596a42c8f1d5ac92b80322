Shehu Sani, the Senator representing Kaduna Central has reacted to National Council of State’s decision to peg minimium wage at N30,000 for federal, N27,000 for state workers. The council, presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the presidential Villa, Abuja approved N30,000 for federal workers and N27,000 for thier state counterparts. The senator in a tweet decried the outcome of the decision, adding the amount is meagre for workers in a nation where even government agencies are declaring ‘record breaking’ billions and trillions in revenues. “National Council of State,what will you gain by ‘cutting 3k from 30k’,in a nation where even Government agencies are declaring ‘record breaking’ Billions and trillions in revenues;And also states,making claims of higher IGR?”, he said.
