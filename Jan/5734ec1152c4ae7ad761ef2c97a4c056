Senator Dino Melaye has been moved by police operatives fromÂ  Garki Abuja police clinic where he was receiving medical attention to a more discreet police facility. Daily Trust gathered from sources Friday that Melaye was moved because of the traffic of lawmakers visiting him at the Garki hospital which has hampered investigations. Melaye is expected to answer questions from police investigators over his alleged involvement in the shooting of a police sergeant on stop and search duty in Lokoja. It was gathered that he is being kept at a secure police location with adequate medical facilities so as to fast track the investigation. It was learnt that Melaye has not been cooperating with police interrogators, even after he was declared fit to answer questions by doctors at the Garki hospital. Attempts to get comment from police spokesman, DCP Jimoh Moshood was unsuccessful. He did not answer phone calls or texts messages sent to him at the time of filing this report.
