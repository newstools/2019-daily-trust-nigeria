Governor Nasir El Rufaia of Kaduna State has alleged that the state chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is planning to disrupt the  coming election due to fear of defeat. El Rufai, who spoke at a stakeholders’ meeting at Kudan yesterday,  assured the people that the security agents were already on the alert to ensure peaceful elections. The governor said the reports didn’t suggest that the opposition party would forment trouble in Kaduna State but government was not taking chances. “As a leader, it is my responsibility to tell you what is being planned because there are a lot of PDP bigwigs in Kudan local government and they may try to disturb the peace of this area,” El Rufai said. He advised the people of Kudan local government to shun any politician who approached them with plots to cause crisis in the run up to the polls or during elections. “Politics is about conviction. There is no compulsion in politics. Siblings of the same family can vote for different parties or candidates. It is our duty as a government to ensure security so that people can exercise their franchise,” he also said. The governor, who also explained the reason why he chose Dr Hadiza Balarabe as his running mate, argued that her choice has nothing to do with religion or ethnicity but her competence. El Rufai said that “ethno-religious considerations have always informed the choice of deputy governors since 1992 but it has not  brought peace in Kaduna state.” The governor said that  it was time to discard politics of religion and ethnicity and embrace a merit based system that will bring progress and development in the country. One week after, Kaduna LG polls continue to raise dust Men who want to unseat el-Rufai El-Rufai, Ashiru, Magaji, 4 others to seek Kaduna APC ticket
