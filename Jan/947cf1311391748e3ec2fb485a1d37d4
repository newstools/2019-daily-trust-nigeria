The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has raided a secret drug factory in Abia state, recovered 400kilograms of Diazepam and arrested four suspects. The factory was located along Aba/Port Harcourt expressway, in Aba. The Diazepam was in both tablets and powdery form when NDLEA officials invaded the premises where they also seized the dilatants. The active ingredients (Diazepam) with diluents such as binders and fillers like maize â€“ starch/sugar, plus manganese stearate and blue colour were compressed into mould and set into tablets for human consumption. Displaying the tablets alongside the suspects before newsmen at the NDLEA command headquarters in Aba, the state Commander, Mr Akingbade Bamidele, said the suspects branded their tablets as Diazepam, which they claimed to be produced in India, thus deceiving members of the public. According to the Commander, Diazepam is a controlled drug that could only be produced under a strict and monitored environment, as it could result to addiction. He maintained that the drug is use for the treatment of a condition called insomnia which produces critical and lasting effects on the central nervous system leading to dizziness. He lamented that a lot of people using drugs made from fake drug factories could died or suffer brain damage and possibly serious addiction. Akingbade said four suspects were arrested at the factory adding that the factory owner was on the run but promised he would be apprehend. 400kg diazepam seized in bust on fake Aba lab (photos) Abuja NDLEA arrests 147 suspects, recovers fake $1.9m in 1 month NDLEA arrests 147suspects, recovers fake $1.9m in one month
