The Federal Capital Territory Internal Revenue Service (FCT-IRS) has said it is working hard to boost the revenue profile of the territory to about N130 billion in 2019. Abdullahi Attah, the Executive Chairman, Federal Capital Territory Internal Revenue Service, FCT-IRS,  stated this last week in Abuja when he addressed journalists as part of his end of year activities. Attah said the board had embarked on sensitisation to educate the populace on the need to pay taxes promptly and to entrench a world class tax administration system in the FCT. He said achieving next year’s projection would be possible as they were relying on the experiences of FIRS and facilities to excel. “We can achieve this because this transition from the Federal Inland Revenue Service, FIRS to FCT IRS has given us eight offices and 177 staff so that we can, for this purpose, take over all the past records and seamlessly transit with the taxpayers knowing what happens. “We were able to generate N59 billion with just one office, 30 staff and about 40 youth corps member; collaborating with the FIRS in 2019, we will double our revenue generation,” he stated. He stressed that over a million taxpayers had been captured in their database and that they had all received their Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TIN), through personalised SMS. He added that the taxpayers who were yet to get their Taxpayer Identification Numbers were advised to visit any of the 10 FCT-IRS offices to obtain same through a process that lasts for not more than 10 minutes because it was a continuous process.
