The High Court II in Gusau, presided by Justice Bello Aliyu Gusau, yesterday, issued an order of interim injunction restraining the suspension of four members of the Zamfara State House of Assembly. The Zamfara assembly had suspended four of its members over alleged ties with the G8, a group of some aggrieved APC members in the state who had parted ways with Governor Abdulaziz Yari. The suspended lawmakers were Abdullahi Muhammad Dansadau, Mani Malam Mumini, Salisu Musa Tsafe and Mansur Ahmed Bungudu. Not satisfied with reasons for their suspension, the four lawmakers went to court to challenge the decision. Justice Aliyu Gusau, yesterday, asked the defendants in the case, including the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Alhaji Sanusi Garba Rikiji, the state assembly and the clerk of the state House of Assembly to halt the suspension of the four lawmakers. The nine orders of interim injunction issued by the court, which were pending to the determination of the motion on notice for interlocutory injunction included restraining the ad hoc committee purportedly set up by the defendants on January 3 or any other committee or body by whatever nameÂ  set up or to be set up by the defendants to hear or consider the allegations made against the plaintiffs. He equally directed the defendants or their agents to continue to accord to the plaintiffs all the rights and privileges that accrue to members of the state House of Assembly.
