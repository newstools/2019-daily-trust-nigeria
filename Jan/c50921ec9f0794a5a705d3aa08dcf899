The PDP Presidential Campaign Organisation (PPCO) has accused the Presidency of diverting military funds for President Muhammadu Buhari’s second term campaign. PPCO also asked the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the Department of State Service (DSS) and Interpol to probe the alleged diversion of N1.032 trillion for the acquisition of Etisalat Nigeria and Key Stone Bank by Buhari’s family. The director, Media and Publicity of PPCO, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, alleged at a press conference, yesterday in Abuja, that the Presidency and the APC were also working hard to compromise officials of INEC to rig the February 16 presidential election. “We make this demand in view of public insinuations that the money may have been sourced from funds meant for the purchase of weapons for our soldiers,” he said. “More so, the Buhari Presidency has blatantly refused to respond to allegations that military fund is being used to finance President Buhari’s re-election campaign which even manifested in the use of military resources to produce APC’s campaign materials, including an electronic momento book by the Minister of Defence, Mansur Muhammad Dan-Ali. “The PPCO is deeply worried by the disturbing videos of our gallant soldiers languishing and being killed by insurgents due to neglect and failure of the Buhari administration to adequately equip them in the fronts,” he said.
