The Gubernatorial candidate of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Benue State, Barr. Emmanuel Jime has vowed to abolish the joint account regime of the current administration in the state. He disclosed this while meeting with Benue citizens residing in the Federal Capital Territory, in Abuja on Wednesday night. Jime said “we want the local government areas to have their allocations, to ensure grassroots developments.” He posited that true development must start from the grassroots and abolishing the joint account regime will kick start that. Jime lamented that Benue was currently at a crossroad as the incumbent had ‘completely lost direction”, adding that it will take someone like him to bring it back on track. While soliciting the supports of the Benue indigines in Abuja in actualizing his dream of becoming the state governor, he pledged to prioritize security, economy, healthcare delivery, education, infrastructural development and social welfare. He argued that the state needed to be connected to the centre to enjoy from the “national cake”, the reason Benue people must vote for APC in the gubernatorial election. On his part, the Director General of his campaign organisation, Senator Jack Gyado assured that “he will not spend your money when he gets to the government house because he is very modest.” He posited that Jime was the only one to liberate the state which, he said, was sinking very fast and deep.
