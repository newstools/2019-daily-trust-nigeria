Majority of senators yesterday stayed away from plenary, a development that forced the only nine senators present to adjourn sitting to today for lack of quorum. It was learnt that most of the senators were at their various senatorial districts campaigning for their reelection, while those that got governorship tickets were also said to be campaigning for votes. Daily Trust had on Sunday reported that 41 senators lost the opportunity of returning to the Red Chamber based on the list of Senate candidates released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) last Thursday. A total of 68 senators got return tickets. Our correspondent reports that this is the second time that senators would adjourn plenary sitting in about three months for lack of quorum. On November 13, 2018, the senators were forced to adjourn their plenary session due to a similar reason for not meeting the quorum. There are 109 senators in the Red Chamber, and based on their rules, a plenary sitting could only be held when there is at least one-third of the senators present at the commencement of the session.
