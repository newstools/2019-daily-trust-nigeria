Persons living with disabilities (PWDs) have promised to mobilise physically challenged persons eligible to vote to come out for the February 16 presidential election and vote for the PDP flag bearer, Atiku Abubakar, because Nigeria will be habitable for them under him. The spokesman of PWDs under the aegis of Atiku/Obi Vision 4 Disabilities, Hon. Paul Danladi, a person living with disability, said at a press conference over the weekend that only Atiku could tackle the current security challenges as the physically challenged were the most vulnerable in crises and clash situations apart from women and children.  2019: INEC assures fair deal for physically challenged Constraints of physically challenged entrepreneurs Disables association decries governmentâ€™s neglect in Yobe
