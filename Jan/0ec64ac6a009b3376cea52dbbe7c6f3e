A 41-year-old commercial bus driver, Jelili Lawal, who allegedly raped a 78-year-old woman in an isolated area of Adeniyi Jones, Ikeja, Lagos, has been arrested. The police said that the incident happened in the evening of the New Year day. It was learnt that the victim, names withheld, had allegedly approached Lawal at the Maryland area of the Lagos metropolis seeking help from him on how to get to her house at Ketu. The police alleged that the suspect misguided the old woman and took her to a lonely place at Oloti Village, off Adeniyi Jones, Ikeja, where he raped her. The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal, who paraded the suspect at the Commanded Headquarters, Ikeja, yesterday, said, “While the suspect was at it, the woman let out a cry that attracted someone in the neighbourhood who quickly called the police and directed them to the location where the cry emanated from. That was how the police caught the suspect in the act and rescued the old woman who was already bleeding from her private part as a result of the assault. “The victim has been taken to the hospital and is being counselled by a trauma specialist. The suspect will be charged to court as soon as investigation is over.” Edgal also disclosed that in a related development, a report was made on January 3, 2019 at the Alakuko police station, Lagos, that one Samuel Balogun, 17, of Number 14, Ademola Aboila Street, Alakuko, Lagos, took a 12-year-old  girl to an uncompleted building and had unlawful carnal knowledge of her.
