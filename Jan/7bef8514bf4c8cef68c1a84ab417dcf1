A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the FCT, Alhaji Musa Yahaya Muhammad, has said the re – election of the incumbent chairman of Abaji Area Council, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, is a done deal. Muhammad, who was an aspirant of the House of Representatives in the last primaries, stated this during an interview with our reporter in Abaji on yesterday. He said as a stakeholder of APC, he would work assiduously to ensure that APC retains power in the council. He said apart from APC retaining Abaji area council, he would also mobilize his supporters across the rural areas to vote for Buhari and national assembly candidates of the party. “‘I want to assure all and sundry that the coming elections in Abaji is a done deal, as is going to be a land slide victory for APC right from the presidency down to local government and ward level, God willing,” he said. The former chairman of the council noted that the APC led administration of Abdulrahman Ajiya has performed well especially in the area of infrastructural development and in education sector.
