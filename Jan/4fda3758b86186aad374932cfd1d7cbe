The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says it is empowered by the extant laws to use the card reader technology for accreditation as against the insinuations that its usage would amount to illegality following President Muhammadu Buhari’s refusal to give assent to the 2018 Electoral Act Amendment Bill. The INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, who spoke yesterday during a consultative meeting with the media in Abuja, said the commission had residual powers under the 2010 Electoral Act ( as amended) to adopt any accreditation and procedure convenient to it. Prof. Yakubu said the use of card reader could not be affected by the declined assent to the 2018 electoral act amendment bill. He said the use of smart card readers for accreditation in the 2019 general elections was mandatory and clause 10 of the election guidelines made it offensive for a concerned election duty staff not to use the device for accreditation. He denied the insinuations that new polling units or voting points settlements were being created by INEC. Earlier while presenting the 2019 general elections guidelines, Okechukwu Evans, INEC National Commissioner in charge of Operations announced that in line with the existing electoral act 2010 (as amended), there would be manual transmission of results in this year’s elections. Evans also said that the simultaneous accreditation and voting pattern experimented in the off season elections would be used for the forthcoming polls.
