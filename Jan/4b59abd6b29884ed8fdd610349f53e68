The Deputy Director, Youth Mobilisation of the APC Presidential Campaign Council, Alhaji Ismaeel Ahmed, has said that Nigerian youth will repeat the feat achieved in 2015 by re-electing President Muhammadu Buhari. Ahmed spoke in Abuja when he met with different youth support groups working for the re-election of Buhari at the campaign office. The Senior Special Adviser on Social Investment to President Buhari, who said the love and efforts of youth working for the re-election of President Buhari would always be recognised, stated that the meeting was arranged for the groups to consolidate on their efforts as significant units of a larger body. “We are here to let you all know that your labour of love is recognised and that you are not alone in this movement,” he said.
