The Social Democratic Party (SDP) chairmanship candidate for Gwagwalada Area Council election, Alhaji Abubakar Jibrin Giri, has said he is confident of winning the March 9, 2019 area council election. Giri, who spoke with newsmen after meeting with some Gbari elders in Dobi community in Gwagwalada on Friday, said he won the 2016 council election but was allegedly denied the mandate, adding that the people who voted for him at the time were still ready to stand by him and protect their votes. He noted that his track record in office was what had endeared him to the people. He said he was impressed with the peaceful nature of campaigns by candidates for the council seat, unlike the 2016 elections, adding that he hoped the forthcoming elections would also be peaceful. The chairmanship candidate said he was unperturbed by incumbency, saying “I was incumbent when I lost out during my first tenure, while Goodluck Jonathan, was an incumbent when he lost out to Buhari in 2015, so what are we are saying?” Giri, therefore, called on other candidates to advise their supporters to continue to sustain the peaceful house-to-house campaign and cautioned his supporters to remain peaceful and law-abiding to constituted authorities.
