A broadcaster with the state-owned Cross River Broadcasting Corporation, (CRBC), Mr Peter Etim, popularly called Petex, has been abducted in Calabar. The DSS and PPRO of the state police command, Irene Igbo said they were aware of the kidnap, and were working to establish contact with the kidnappers. The incident was said to have happened early in the morning when the victim was about to leave his house to his work place. Chairman of Nigeria Union of Journalists in Cross River State, Comrade Victor Ndu has condemned the kidnap of the ace broadcaster and called for immediate release of Petex. Ndu called on the security agencies in the state to wake up to their duties. It is suspected that Petex may have made a political statement that was not palatable.
