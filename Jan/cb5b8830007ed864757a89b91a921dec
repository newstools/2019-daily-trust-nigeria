Gan Allah Fulani Development Association of Nigeria has exonerated itself from what it described as ‘dangerously selfish and unilateral endorsement’ of President Muhammadu Buhari as its candidate in the forthcoming 2019 general elections. Reacting to the alleged endorsement of PMB in 2019 by some pastoralists, the National Secretary-General of the association, Ibrahim Abdullahi in a statement issued on Wednesday in Kaduna said the recent endorsement of a candidate by a group of pastoralists could, if allowed unchallenged, pitch the innocent, maligned and neglected pastoralists against other Nigerians. While noting that the endorsement will create more hardship on pastoralists in states governed by other political parties, he called on candidates from other political parties and other Nigerians to disregard the ‘so-called’ endorsement by some selfish individuals who do not care whatever happens to their members as long as they can satisfy their pecuniary interests. He added that: “The association held an emergency meeting to discuss wide-ranging issues affecting pastoralists across the nation with a view to proffering solution and way forward. “The meeting observed that of recent, some pastoralists associations have enmeshed themselves and their members into partisan politics, a position that could further escalate their already degenerating relationships with other segments of the society. “The meeting therefore condemned these pronouncements made without any consultation and or consensus by the generality of the pastoralists across the country and called on pastoralists to vote for any candidate who has a programme that will alleviate their suffering irrespective of party, tribe or religion.” He disclosed that the association has concluded plans to embark on Ruga to Ruga and hamlet to hamlet consultations across the country to sensitise pastoralists on how best to approach the 2019 elections. He however called on candidates from other political parties to feel free and highlight their policies and programmes as they affect the welfare and well-being of Nigerian pastoralists and urged traditional leaders who are not partisan to call leaders of these associations to order.
