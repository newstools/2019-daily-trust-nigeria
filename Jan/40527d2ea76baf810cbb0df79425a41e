Members of the National Association of Nigerian Traders (NANTS) have organised a sensitisation rally in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to educate residents on the dangers of importing food produced locally. The women members of the association, in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Standard Organisation of Nigeria, Nigeria Customs Service, and Nigerian Agricultural Quarantine Service also sensitised residents on the wrong use of chemicals for food preservation. The National Women Leader of NANTS, Ruth Agbo said the campaign was necessary to inform marketers, hoteliers, traders and other stakeholders on the dangers of selling or patronising illegally imported goods. She said the unwholesome act of using chemicals to preserve food has endangered many lives hence concerted efforts should be made to ensure compliance with stipulated standards.
