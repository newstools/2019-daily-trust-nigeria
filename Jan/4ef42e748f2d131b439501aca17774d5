The Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC)’s customers, on Thursday, protested in Lokoja, the Kogi State capital against epileptic power supply and exorbitant bills by the distribution company. The protesters, who were mostly from Ganaja Village, on the outskirts of Lokoja, matched through the Murtala Muhammad way to AEDC’s Office, carrying placards bearing various inscription. Spokesman of the protesters, Liman Isiaq said they were forced to embark on the protest to draw the attention of the world to the hardships they were undergoing in terms of poor electricity supply and exorbitant bills. He said the community only enjoys eight hours of electricity a day while the distribution company kept bringing exorbitant and indiscriminate bills to them despite the situation. He urged the management of the AEDC to address the epileptic power supply situation and as well as provide prepaid meters for them to bring an end to the issue of “crazy billings” which is usually associated with estimated billing. Although, the Area Manager was not on ground but some officials of AEDC who addressed the protesters urged them to be patience, assuring that management of the disco would look into their complaints with view to resolving them.
