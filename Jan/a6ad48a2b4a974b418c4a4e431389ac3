The Federal Government has extended the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) Registration Business Incentive Strategy (BIS) by three months, the Acting Registrar General of the commission, Azuka Azinge, has said. Speaking at the customers/stakeholders forum, yesterday, in Kano, Lady Azinge said the incentive was extended from 1st January to 31st March 2019 to enable more Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) formalise their businesses. Lady Azinge, therefore, urged members of the public and private sectors to take advantage of the extension to register their business names at the reduced cost of N5,000 only. She noted that during the initial three months, BIS registration had increased tremendously, as in the second quarter of 2018 (April to June) 30,941 companies were registered. She added that in the third quarter (July to September) 32,504 were registered and from October to December a total of 66,687 companies were captured. The acting registrar general said the CAC embarked on some reforms with a view to improving on its services being rendered to the teeming business men and women across the country. Earlier, during a panel discussion, Professor Murtala Sabo Sagagi, dean Dangote School of Business, Bayero University Kano, urged the commission to intensify action on its sensitisation campaign to enable people know more about the importance of registering their businesses. Professor Sagagi said a survey conducted recently had shown that out of the 400 SMEs sampled in Tarauni local government, only three registered with CAC, seven registered with the state government, nine with local government and 388 had never registered the names of their businesses.
