He said, “Our project wouldn’t stop working until we deliver Plateau state to Atiku, we intended to work for him because of his vision for our dear state Plateau and country, his high level of competency to lead is second to none and has what it takes to take Nigeria to a greater place.” Dr Gushibet explained that Atiku is a better economist and strategist because when he was the Vice President, he was the engine room behind Obasanjo’s successes. He said, “He (Atiku) assembled good hands that transformed Nigeria’s economy. When Obasanjo became President Nigeria was already a depressed economy, both Obasanjo and Atiku didn’t blame the military. “They brought Nigeria out of the woods and now the economy was destroyed by the present government. And the only person that would make Nigeria working again is Atiku.” He said. He urged Nigerians to challenge government of the day untill better Nigeria was achieved by voting Atiku the next president.
