The House of Representatives yesterday shifted debates on the 2019 budget, initially billed to commence yesterday, until today. The shift followed a request by the House Leader, Femi Gbajabiamila (APC, Lagos) for the presiding Deputy Speaker, Yusuf Lasun (APC, Osun) to give the lawmakers 24 hours to study the 2019 Appropriation Bill in detail. “Mr Speaker, I want you to step this bill down until tomorrow so as to give us about 24 hours to study the bill in detail,” Gbajabiamila requested. Lasun, who had called on the House Leader to lead a second reading of the Appropriation Bill, however, granted the request to shelve the debates till Wednesday. In granting the request, the deputy speaker called on the lawmakers interested in taking part in the debates to ensure that they register their names in accordance with the House rules. Lasun had earlier noted that misrepresentation of figures in the 2019 budget was one of the reasons the lawmakers could not commence debates on the bill. “One of the reasons why we did not start debates on the 2019 budget last week was the discovery of slight errors in reporting the figures contained in the budget. “For instance, the N492 billion for statutory transfers does not correspond with the wording in the budget but that has been corrected. “The same applies for the N2 trillion for capital expenditure, which has also been corrected,” he said.
