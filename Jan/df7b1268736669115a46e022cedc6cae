The Ekiti State Government has said that the spate of kidnapping and other criminal activities increased in the state after the withdrawal of military personnel from checkpoints across the state. Deputy Governor Bisi Egbeyemi, who said this, called on the military to restrategise on tackling security challenges bedevilling the state by returning military checkpoints on the highways. In a statement yesterday by his Special Assistant (Media), Odunayo Ogunmola, the deputy governor called on the military to look for more alternative means of preventing criminals from perpetrating their activities. Egbeyemi was said to have made the call in Ado Ekiti, at a church service to mark this year’s Armed Forces Remembrance Day. Egbeyemi said: “In Nigeria, the security system is not as it is in the abroad, you must have gone out to some of these countries. And those of us who have been to Britain, American and China, you must have seen military men in the market and everywhere watching over the people. “We should imbibe the same spirit to make sure that we are safe. We need to keep Nigeria one by making sure they are safe.” The deputy governor stressed the need to remember the fallen heroes and take proper care of those currently serving the country. In his sermon, the Government House Chaplain, Rev. Lawrence Adetola, described military men as God’s ministers sent to secure the live of the people on earth, adding that they needed prayers to succeed in curbing security challenges in the country. “The Armed Forces Remembrance Day provides the opportunity to remember those who lost their lives while serving the nation and the need to support, pray and show care for their loved ones left behind,” the cleric said.
