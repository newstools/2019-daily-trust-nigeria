The United States government has dismissed as “incorrect” reports that its missions in Abuja and Lagos have shutdown indefinitely due to the American government shutdown. The U.S Embassy in Abuja dismissed the report in a statement on Wednesday. It said the Embassy in Abuja and the Consulate General in Lagos will remain open during the government shutdown. It also said Consular Sections will remain open. It, however, said the American Centres and EducationUSA offices operating on embassy and consulate grounds will remain closed throughout the shutdown. The statement reads: “The U.S. Embassy in Abuja and the Consulate General in Lagos will remain open during the U.S. government shutdown. “This includes the Consular Sections.  Prior reports to the contrary were incorrect. “American Centres and EducationUSA offices operating on embassy and consulate grounds that are managed by Mission Public Affairs Sections will remain closed throughout the shutdown. “American Spaces, such as American Corners operated by partner institutions and located off embassy or consulate grounds, however, will remain open.”
