The trial of 11 individuals over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi has begun in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, state media report. Prosecutors have asked for the death penalty for five of the defendants. Khashoggi, a prominent US-based critic of the Saudi government, was killed after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, on 2 October. Saudi Arabia has refused Turkey’s request to extradite 18 suspects for trial, including 15 alleged agents who it says flew to Istanbul to carry out the killing. Little information was released by state media other than that the first session of the criminal court’s hearing of the case had begun and that the 11 defendants and their lawyers were present. Defence lawyers requested a copy of the indictment sheet and time to review it. No date was set for the next hearing.
