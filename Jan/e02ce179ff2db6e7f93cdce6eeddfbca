Emir of Kano Malam Muhammadu Sanusi II, yesterday, said effective understanding and application of the value chain in tomato is the only way to achieve sustainable positive development in its production. Speaking during the maiden edition of the National Tomato Stakeholders’ Summit (NTSS) held at Kano Government House, Emir Sanusi said unless equal importance is attached to each and every aspect within the value chain’s components, desired result will be very hard to attain. According to him, each component of the value chain is as strong as the weakest. He added that there is need to revisit some government policies, especially the banning of importation of some products for effective result to be attained. In his welcome address, president of Nigeria Agribusiness Group (NABG), Alhaji Sani Dangote, said the summit was organised for stakeholders in tomato production in Nigeria to meet and discuss the possibilities of devising ways through which the losses incurred annually by tomato producers would be reduced to a minimal level.
