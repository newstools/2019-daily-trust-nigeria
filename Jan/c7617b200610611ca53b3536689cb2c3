The lawmaker representing Kaduna Central at the National Assembly, Senator Shehu Sani, has noted that the much anticipated presidential debate is not by force for President Muhammadu Buhari to attend. According to him, the President talks to Nigerians almost on daily basis and should not be crucified for failing to attend the debate. Buhari’s political party, the All Progressives Congress, APC, had earlier stated that the President may not be available for the debate. In a tweet he wrote in pidgin English on Tuesday, the lawmaker noted that some persons just want to force the President to come out for debate so as to disgrace him. Shehu Sani tweeted, “If Baba [Buhari] no wan debate make you leave am; abi na by force? “All the talk wey he dey talk everyday no do you? “Una just want make he come then u begin disgrace am with quote quote China this China that; If na China talk dey sweet una, Baba don go there tire.Make una take your time o!”  Why Buhari ‘dodged’ debating Jonathan We challenge Buhari to a debate Inside 2019 presidential debate furore
