 The Chairman of Gwagwalada Area Council, Alhaji Adamu Mustapha, has said his administration has provided viable infrastructure within the last two and half years despite the economic instability. Adamu, while addressing APC supporters in Dobi, yesterday, noted that the year 2018 had not been easy for the people, but said one needed to still appreciate God to overcome such challenges. He said the council under his administration had prioritised some projects since he assumed office, which he said included the completion of Abalaka – ECWA Church road, Yimi/Machada rural electrification, evacuation of refuse within the metropolis, electrification of Dukpa, Ledi and Kuku communities and disbursement of scholarships to indigent students. According to him, the council had also completed abandoned health centres at Giri and Shenagu communities which, he said, patients now easily visit to access medical treatment. “Despite the dwindling economy, and political instability, you will agree with me that we have been able to do our best, especially in the area of infrastructure and I will like to urge all our teaming supporters to cheer up as we move to the next level,” he said. The chairman, therefore, called residents of the council, especially the youth, not to allow anybody use them as thugs during the election, saying they should remain law abiding to constituted authorities.
