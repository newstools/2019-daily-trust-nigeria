President Muhammadu Buhari has said that he is deeply pained by the death of his supporters in Jigawa state in an auto accident on their way to attend campaign events. Four persons reportedly died and six others were injured in an accident involving party supporters who were going to attend the All Progressives Congress (APC) campaign in Jigawa. The president also expressed his condolences to the families of two other victims who died in a stampede in Sokoto state, and assured that the sacrifices of the deceased will not be in vain. In a statement by his Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, the President was quoted saying: “The death of any party supporter touches me because these were poor Nigerians who made sacrifices to make Nigeria a better country by identifying with my change agenda.” “I would never forget the sacrifices of these ordinary Nigerians who travelled long distances to attend my presidential campaign rallies. “These ordinary Nigerians were the pillars of our democracy because without them, we, the politicians, become irrelevant.” Meanwhile, following the unprecedented wave of popularity of the President’s outdoor events, the Presidency has ordered for increased structural integrity testing of all erections and fabrications such as dais, tents, stages, including electrical and other equipment.
