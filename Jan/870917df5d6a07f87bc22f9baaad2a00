Chairmen of 51 political parties, on Friday, endorsed Plateau State Governor, Simon Bako Lalong as their governorship candidate in the upcoming general elections. The chairmen pledged their support at the official flag-off of the All Progressives Congress (APC) gubernatorial campaign at the Rwang Pam stadium in Jos through the state party chairman of KOWA political party, Salihu Abdullahi who is also the Plateau State Vice Chairman of the Inter-Party Advisory Committee (IPAC). The event witnessed a huge turnout, including dignitaries such as the National Chairman of the APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, the Director General of the Buhari/Osinbajo campaign organization, Rotimi Amaechi, Vice Chairman of the Buhari/Osinbajo campaign organisation for North, George Akume, Minister of State for Aviation, Hadi Sirika as well as former Deputy Governor of Plateau State, Pauline Tallen. Comrade Adams Oshiomhole also received three prominent members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) with their supporters, led by one time governorship aspirant, Ambassador Chris Giwa. Oshiomhole said Governor Lalong had given practical expression to the meaning of progressives by implementing people oriented policies. “The fact that he cleared almost one year of salary arrears left by the last PDP government didn’t stop him from building roads, schools, recognising the youths, the disabled and bringing peace to the state,” he said. In his speech, Governor Simon Bko Lalong said he was aware that Ambassador Chris Giwa had tried to resurrect the PDP but now that he has crossed over to the APC is an indication that the PDP was dead.
