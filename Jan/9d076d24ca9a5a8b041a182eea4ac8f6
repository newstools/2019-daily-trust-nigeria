The governorship candidate‎ of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Bauchi State, Senator Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed has alleged that his supporters were being harassed and arrested by the police in the state on the orders of the ruling All Progressive Party, APC . ‎He disclosed this while addressing journalists after securing the release of some of his supporter‎s arrested at a PDP office along Gombe road. Mohammed said that, the orchestrated plot was a ploy by the ruling APC to intimidate his supporters prior to the elections. Bala added that the alleged complicity of the police in the indiscriminate arrest on the orders of the government in the state was threatening the peace accord signed by governorship candidates, including Governor Mohammed Abdullahi Abubakar. “We know all their antics and we will not condone this,” he said. “In Bauchi, there is an effort by Governor Mohammed Abubakar in cohort with the police ‎to clamp down on our supporters on trump up charges. “This is just the beginning but we are law abiding and we have reported the cases to all relevant security agencies, including the police and the Department of Security Services (DSS),” he said.‎ Speaking, the State APC Organising Secretary, Lawan Gyan-Gyan dismissed the allegation as baseless‎ and a trademark of the PDP governorship candidate.

He said that the police had the power to arrest‎ anybody who breaks the law whether he belongs to the opposition or the ruling party.
