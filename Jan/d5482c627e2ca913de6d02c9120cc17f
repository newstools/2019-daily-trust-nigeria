Unidentified gunmen have shot and injured three persons at Gudun- Karya, Kuje Area Council, barely two weeks after two persons were killed and three others were injured at Gwombe village in the same area council. A resident, who identified himself as Usman, said the gunmen invaded the community around 11:47 pm on Saturday. He said the gunmen went to the house of their victim to abduct him but he was absent, then they fired sporadic shot which caught three persons. “Actually, they missed their target when they came to kidnap a member of the community but the man was not at home, “ he said. He said the sound of gun shots threw the entire community into pandemonium. He said he came out of the room after the gunmen had left and discovered three persons with bullet wounds lying on the ground. According to him, the victims were taken to a clinic at Lokogoma village in Nasarawa state. Reacting, the chairman of the council, Alhaji Abdullahi D. Galadima, who confirmed the attack through his special adviser on media and publicity, Haruna Usman, said the chairman visited community on Sunday to sympathize with the people. He said the chairman also visited the hospital where the injured victims were still receiving treatment, saying the chairman was saddened over the incident.
