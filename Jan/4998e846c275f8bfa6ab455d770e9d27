The All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in Benue State, Emmanuel Jime, has promised people of the state a free, compulsory primary education if voted into power in the forthcoming election. Jime made the promise while addressing crowd of supporters at the APC’s governorship campaign flag-off, held at the IBB square in Makurdi. “I am passionate about education because if there is a child in the remotest part of Ekile in Ado LGA in the hinterlands of the Idoma and Igede nations who cannot read and write, it matters to me because that also could have been my child. “I make this solemn pledge to you: that from May 29th this year when I will be sworn into office as your governor, I shall declare and properly implement free and compulsory primary education in Benue state,” he said. The gubernatorial hopeful lamented the state of educational system in the state, stressing that the sector remained in shambles and that the last four years, the government had hardly added a single new desk to any classroom in any school anywhere in Benue state. He further stated that his administration, when voted into power, will introduce automation and digitisation of public school libraries; and provide great incentives for teachers in rural communities. Jime added, “we will take a digital approach to supervision to ensure our wards in the rural areas get the top quality education they deserve.” Also speaking, the North Central leader of the party, Senator George Akume, who went down on his kneels apologised to Benue people for giving them a governor in 2015, emphasising that he was disappointed that the governor could not perform. Akume assured the people that he would correct his past mistake by bringing a new governor (Jime) in the coming election who would pay salaries, pensions and gratuities of those presently deserving, as he urged the electorate to vote for Jime as governor.
