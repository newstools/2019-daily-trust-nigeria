Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah of central Pahang state has been named Malaysia’s new king, replacing Sultan Muhammad V who abdicated unexpectedly after just two years on the throne. Sultan Muhammad V, 49, resigned on January 6 as Malaysia’s 15th king, cutting short his five-year term in the first abdication in the nation’s history. No reason was given, but it came after he reportedly married a 25-year-old former Russian beauty queen in November. Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah, a keen athlete who holds a string of positions on sporting bodies, including at the world football governing body FIFA, was elected as the new king on Thursday during a special meeting of Malaysia’s Islamic royalty. “[Abdullah] has been chosen as the 16th Yang di-Pertuan Agong [‘He Who Is Made Lord’ in Malay] for a period of five years starting from January 31, 2019,” said a statement from the Keeper of the Rulers’ Seal, Syed Danial Syed Ahmad.
