The FCT Transport Secretary, Mr. Kayode Opeifa, has said that arrangements are being put in place to reintroduce ‘park and pay’ on some major streets of the territory. Opeifa stated this while speaking with newsmen in Abuja last Thursday. He said the reintroduction of the policy had become necessary to restore sanity on major roads in the FCT. He stated that the enabling laws were being fine-tuned by the administration to make way for the return of the policy, adding that the intention of the policy was to generate revenue, even as he said the administration would ensure the roads were not used for parking. “For example, if you go to Aminu Kano Crescent and see what is happening there, it is quite unfortunate because of the way people park their vehicles anyhow,” he said. According to him, as soon as the street parking policy takes off, there would be no pedestrian enforcement, saying the secretariat would as much as possible use technology to ensure the people park and pay freely. The secretary added “If you don’t want to park, you can move into the inner city as our focus now is solely on revenue. It is going to strictly based on traffic management, safety and security of pedestrians.” Abuja’s mismanaged park-and-pay policy Now that ‘park and pay’ is ‘illegal’ in FCT, what next?
