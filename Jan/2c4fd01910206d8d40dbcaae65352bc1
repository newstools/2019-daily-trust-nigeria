The Vice Chairman of Buhari/Osinbajo campaign organisation for the North, Sen. George Akume has described Makudi, the capital city of Benue State, as the dirties capital in the country. Akume, who is from Benue, stated this at the official flag-off of the re-election campaign of Governor Simon Bako Lalong of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at the Rwang Pam stadium in Jos on Friday. Taking a swipe at the Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom who decamped from the APC to the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in July 2018, Akume told a gathering of supporters that, “I will bring my governor to Plateau State so that Governor Lalong can go to Benue. Do you know that Makurdi, the capital of Benue is today, the dirtiest state capital in the country?” He further said, “with the developmental strides of the governor of Plateau State, will someone like Lalong be rejected by the people? I doubt. He is qualified to return as governor, so protect your PVC so that you can vote for the next level.” On his part, the Director General of the Buhari/Osinbajo campaign organisation, Rotimi Amaechi said the key to good governance is knowing that poverty is one of the problems that must be addressed, adding that to address poverty, human capital development must be addressed.
