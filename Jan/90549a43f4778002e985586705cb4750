The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) says it is supplying electricity to Kano Electricity Distribution Company (DisCo) through alternative feeder after a transformer tripped causing a 90 megawatts (MW) loss at the Kumbotso Transmission Substation. While the faulty 150MVA transformer is being repaired, TCN in a statement by the General Manager, Public Affairs, Ndidi Mbah, said the DisCo gets bulk electricity through two other units of 150MVA transformers in the substation. Daily Trust reports that the faulty transformer tripped on January 1, 2019 which caused the loss of 90MW on the Kano -Kankia – Katsina 132KV transmission line that feeds Kankia, Katsina and Daura in Katsina State and the Kumbotso – Dakata 132 kV transmission lines in Kano. The fault affected supply of electricity in about eight towns that include Kankia, Katsina and Daura in Katsina State; and Sabon Gari, Dakata, Bompai, Mariri and Gezawa  in Kano State.
