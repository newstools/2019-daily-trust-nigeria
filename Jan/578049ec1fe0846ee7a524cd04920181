The senator representing Delta North at the National Assembly, Senator Peter Nwaoboshi, on Tuesday said he would resign if he loses any unit in his Oshimili North constituency to the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) in the forthcoming general elections. Nwaoboshi, who chairs the senate committee on Niger Delta and also the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), made the remark at the ongoing state-wide PDP campaign in Akwukwu-Igbo, the council headquarters. He said before the cheering crowd that the PDP will not lose any unit in his locality, saying that if he loses any unit, he will resign. Meanwhile, Delt state governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, has charged Senator Nwaoboshi and all PDP supporters to ensure that the party does not lose even a single vote to the opposition in the area. Earlier at Issele-Uku, headquarters of Aniocha north council area, Okowa stated that his opponents in the governorship election lacked what it takes to govern the state, adding that governance of the state is not a matter of trial and error, considering the peculiarities of the state and its importance to the country. He charged the people of Delta North to re-elect him, saying the governorship was not about his person but about the generality of the people of Anioma (Delta north). He therefore urged his Anioma kinsmen to protect what they have by insisting on equity and fairness in the governorship of the state through their votes on March 2, 2019. “I don’t know whether my opponents have capacity but if you see them, ask them if they really have the capacity to govern Delta State. To govern Delta State cannot be by trial and error. It is for somebody with the capacity and capability to deliver,” Okowa said.
