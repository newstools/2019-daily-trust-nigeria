The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar has petitioned the United States of America (USA), United Kingdom (UK) and the European Union (EU), alleging President Muhammadu Buhari is threatening the existence of Nigeria’s democracy. Atiku, in the petition dated January 27, 2019, and addressed to the UK, EU, and US Ambassadors to Nigeria, accused Buhari of serially breaching the provisions of the country’s constitution and undermining organs and institutions of state. Atiku demanded in the petition that the government of these countries pile pressure on the All Progressives Congress (APC) led federal government to desist from alleged right violations and ensure a level playing field for all candidates in the forthcoming general elections. “I am also writing you as Nigeria’s international development partner working together to deepen and strengthen our democracy as well as to help in the transformation of our economies and societies for the better. “While the President has ironically taken oath to safeguard and defend the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the reality of his selective and wanton violations of its provisions means that his oath is observed only in the breach,” Atiku said. The former Vice President also listed as ‘Buhari’s sins’ the “purported suspension of CJN Onnoghen, the illegal purchase of the Tucano Aircrafts, disregard for court orders such as refusal to release on bail  Ibraheem El-Zakzaky, Leader of a Shiite Group, IMN, and Col. Sambo Dasuki (rtd), a former National Security Adviser (NSA),” among others. Atiku added, “The approval of $1 billion for military expenditure before approaching the National Assembly, the Executive Order No. 006 (On Preservation of Suspicious Assets and Related Schedules).” Onnoghen's suspension act of dictatorship - Atiku 2019: No room for rigging, Atiku tells Buhari Suspension of CJN Onnoghen is an act of dictatorship taken too far — Atiku
