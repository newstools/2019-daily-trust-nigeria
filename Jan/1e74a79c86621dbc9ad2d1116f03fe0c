Cameroon is learning much from its neighbor because Nigeria has worked hard to advance its democracy, Alhaji Ahmed Falata, the District Head of Yaoundé, Cameroon said at the 16 Daily Trust Dialogue in Abuja yesterday. Alhaji Ahmed had accompanied the Emir of Gombe Abubakar Shehu Abubakar who was the special guest of honour at the Dialogue. He said, “I have learnt a lot from this occasion. There is a lot of change in youth involvement in government and Cameroon is learning much from Nigeria.” The Cameroonian traditional ruler, who spoke alternately in French and English, also said Cameroon sees Nigeria as a big brother from which there is much to learn. He showered praises on the Emir of Gombe, who he said has shown by concrete example what the youths can do in leadership positions. Others who commented from the audience commended the Not Too Young to run bill signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari but differed on the readiness of the youth to take over leadership positions in the country. While Mani Ibrahim Ahmed, who is running for governorship in Niger State on the platform of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) accused Nigerian youths of waiting for leadership positions to be delivered to them on a platter of gold, Mohammed Adamu Waziri from Gombe thanked President Buhari for assenting to the Not Too Young To Run bill and called on youths to take advantage of the law to contest for leadership positions.
