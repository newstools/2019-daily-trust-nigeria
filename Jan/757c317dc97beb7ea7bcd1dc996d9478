An Upper Area Court 2 Kabong, in Jos, Plateau State, yesterday sentenced a 38-year-old man, Kim Dung, to 10 years imprisonment over illegal manufacturing and assembling of firearms. The judge, Nanlang Dashe, who sentenced Dung without an option of fine, said it would serve as deterrent to others who would want to indulge in such criminal act. Earlier, the prosecutor, Abdullahi Inuwa, told the court that the accused was arrested on Nov. 7, 2018, by officers of the Department of State Security (DSS) at Dantu-Vwang of Vom District in Jos South Local Government Area of Plateau. Inuwa said the accused was arrested while manufacturing and assembling locally made revolver pistols and single barrel guns without license. On arraignment, the accused pleaded guilty to the charge and begged the court for leniency.(NAN)
