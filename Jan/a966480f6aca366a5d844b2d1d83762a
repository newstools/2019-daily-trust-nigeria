Turkey, Russia, and China came to the aid of Venezuela’s leader on Thursday after the United States declared Nicolas Maduro was no longer its president. The pledges of support came after opposition leader Juan Guaido declared himself interim president of Venezuela in an address to tens of thousands of people on the streets of the capital, Caracas. “We are with you,” Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told Maduro in a telephone call, according to his spokesman Ibrahim Kalin. “My brother Maduro. Stay strong, we are by your side.” Russia, meanwhile, warned the US not to intervene militarily in Venezuela, saying its support for Guaido was a “path to lawlessness and bloodshed”. China also voiced support for Maduro. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told local media that Beijing supports “efforts made by the Venezuelan government for national sovereignty, independence and stability,” she added.
