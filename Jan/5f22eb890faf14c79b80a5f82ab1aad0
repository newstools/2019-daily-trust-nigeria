Presidential candidates for the February 16, 2019, election under the umbrella of Forum of Presidential Candidates and Political Parties for Good Governance (FPCPPGG) have said President Muhammadu Buhari has their backing on the suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Walter Onnoghen. Chairman of the FPCPPGG, Alhaji Shittu Muhammed Kabiru, who made the position of the forum known yesterday at a press conference in Abuja, argued that Onnoghen’s removal would not have any negative effect on the 2019 general elections. Alhaji Kabiru argued that the offence allegedly committed by Justice Onnoghen was not a judicial offence, adding that Buhari’s action was just a suspension and not total removal that would have warranted the attention of the National Judicial Council (NJC). “We strongly believe that President Muhammadu Buhari’s suspension of Hon. Justice Onnoghen as CJN is proper and timely. Onnoghen would have proceeded to constitute the Election Petition Panels,” he said. “No wonder some interested elements are shocked that their game plan has been punctured. A desperate disease needs a desperate treatment. President Buhari acted in the overall interest of the masses of Nigeria. “So much is required from the judiciary since they hold the power of life and death. Judges are, therefore, expected to live above board and be incorruptible. “We urge the National Assembly, as it reconvenes, to view the president’s action as non-partisan or motivated by any mundane consideration, but taken purely in the best interest of Nigeria. “Politicians and interest groups should desist from misinforming the people on the patriotic move by the president,” he said.
