Some 37 civilians, including women and children, were killed by gunmen who attacked the mainly Fulani village of Koulhogon, according to the government. “In addition to the 37 people killed, several people were wounded and many houses set on fire,” according to a government statement. The authorities have announced an investigation to shed light on the situation. They also said they were sending the army to the area to restore calm and arrest those responsible. The village is in the central region of Mopti. The Fulani association, Tabital Pulaku, has blamed the attack on the ethnic Dogon militia, Dana Amassagou, which is made up of Donso traditional hunters. The attackers were wearing traditional Donso clothes, according to the government.
