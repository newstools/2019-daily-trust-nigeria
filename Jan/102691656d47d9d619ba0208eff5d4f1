The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Presidential Candidate, Atiku Abubakar on Sunday vowed to walk the talk on restructuring, saying he remains the only Nigerian committed to devolution of power as being clamoured for by some leaders in the country. Atiku also promised to banish what he termed pervasive hunger and create massive employment for the terming youth. The former Vice President who was represented by his wife, Titi Abubakar spoke on Sunday at a well-attended 14th Annual Thanksgiving and Memorial Service organized by former Ogun State Governor, Otunba Gbenga Daniel held at Abraham’s Tabernacle, Baptist International Worship Centre, Sagamu, Ogun State. He attributed poverty among Nigerian masses to what he termed “concentration of too much power at the centre”. “The power at the centre is too much and this has impoverished masses of Nigerians. Atiku wants to give back to Nigeria, it is only Atiku that can get Nigeria working again. Atiku’s presidency will redeem Nigeria, provide jobs, empower women and ensure security of Nigerians wherever they reside. He will also ensure rural development gets top priority in his administration,” he said. In his address, Daniel noted that “Atiku is the only presidential candidate who has been consistent with his calls for the restructuring of Nigeria,” urging Nigerians to vote Atiku for the transformation of the country.
