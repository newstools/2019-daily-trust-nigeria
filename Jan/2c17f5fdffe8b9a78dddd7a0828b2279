The Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly and Chairman, Conference of Speakers of State Legislatures of Nigeria, Hon Mudashiru Obasa, has called on Nigerians to continue to pray for peaceful and successful general elections next year. Obasa, in his message through a release yesterday signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Musbau Rasak, stated, “Nigerians are very resourceful and courageous, and it is obvious that all these, coupled with their prayers and support, have been very vital in the successes recorded so far by the APC administration at all levels.” The Lagos Assembly Speaker assured Nigerians that the APC administration at all levels would continue to put in place programmes and projects that would enhance their welfare and improve their standard of living. The APC administration, he stressed, was committed to improving the lives of the people and would not relent in doing that. Obasa, on behalf of his colleagues at the Lagos State House of Assembly, wished Nigerians “a happy and prosperous 2019”.
