To further combat fake motor insurance across the country, the Nigerian Insurers Association (NIA) has introduced the unstructured supplementary service data (USSD) code. This short code, according to NIA, eliminates all barriers in confirming the authenticity of all motor insurance policies by the policy holder and law enforcement agencies. Speaking at the launch of the code (*565*11#) the chairman of NIA, Mr. Tope Smart, said “it is hoped that with the USSD existing and prospective customers now have the opportunity to confirm the genuineness of their respective policies at the time of purchase to avoid any embarrassment should claim occur.” He recalled that in 2010, NIA took a major step towards eliminating fake insurance certificates in the market through the inception of the Nigerian Insurance Industry Database (NIID), which went live in 2011 and enabled insurance policies obtained by motorists to be checked real time online on the internet and through dedicated hand-held devices. ‘1.7m vehicles captured on insurance data base’ ‘LASG not frustrating insurance monitoring’ 2014: The year of challenges, opportunities in insurance sector
