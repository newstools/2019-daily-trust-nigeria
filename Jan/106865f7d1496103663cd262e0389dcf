A former Nigerian President, Olusegun Obasanjo, has vowed to “do everything humanly possible to ensure the success of democracy in Nigeria.” Obasanjo stated this on Thursday during the presentation of a book entitled, “Politics as Dashed Hopes in Nigeria” by Dr. Auwalu Anwar, at the Musa Yar’Adua Centre, Abuja. In his presentation, the former president said, “I would continue to do everything humanly possible to ensure the success of democracy in Nigeria. “Works of art like this help to document history and factorize issues that matter in the society.” Obasanjo also urged Nigerians not to lose hope in the Nigerian project, especially with issues related to the entrenchment of democratic norms and ideals. In his remarks, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, represented by former Kano State Governor, Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso, said the book marked a major milestone in the development of Nigeria’s constitutional democracy. According to the author, Anwar, the book was a critical commentary on Nigeria’s political scene, and the politicians who have shaped it, specially the “sanctimonious integrity” of President Muhammadu Buhari, from the days of Congress for Progress Change (CPC). 2019 Elections: The world is watching Buhari, others - Obasanjo Jonathan is planning to scuttle Nigeria's democracy-Obasanjo Why I lost in 2015, Jonathan reveals at book launch
