The PDP in Katsina State has said the recent declaration by the APC National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, that President Muhammadu Buhari and Governor Aminu Bello Masari should get all the votes in the state is a clear indication of planned rigging ahead of the polls. The state chairman of the party, Salisu Majigiri, told Daily Trust that the fears and suspicion of the party were being confirmed by the latest comments of Oshiomhole of the purported planned rigging by the APC. “I wonder how they can get 100 per cent votes in Katsina,” he said. “In 2015, they (APC) used religion and ethnicity against our then candidate and still the PDP garnered over 10,000 votes in Katsina and now that all those factors are no more, you can’t beat us or target that figure,” he said. In a related development, the PDP has launched a new programme titled ‘PDP Sawuta’ aimed at mobilising grassroots support ahead of the elections.
