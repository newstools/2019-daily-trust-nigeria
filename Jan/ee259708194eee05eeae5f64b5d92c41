President Muhammadu Buhari said, yesterday, that if re-elected he will remain steadfast in repositioning the police and judiciary in the course of his fight against corruption. He acknowledged that fighting corruption, which was among the cardinal points of his administration, was the most difficult. Buhari said he was never found wanting in his public services, citing from the era he served as governor of six northern states, military head of state and minister of petroleum. Buhari spoke, yesterday, in Abakaliki during the presidential campaign rally of the ruling APC. “The important thing that I assure you as president today is that I have nerve been in position and I abused it,” he said. “I was arrested, detained, investigated but they did not find anything. So I went through all those things,” he said. Buhari expressed sadness over the unfolding cases of corruption among public office holders. He, therefore, appealed to Ebonyians to vote for him on February 16 so as continue his good governance for the development of the nation. He maintained that many of those individuals before taking oath of office did not own houses in cities like Abuja or foreign accounts, but acquired them shortly after getting appointment. “It is sad because we appoint people into public office without them owning a house, not even a good car but in few months they build houses in Abuja, open accounts in Europe or America. When we discover what they have done, we will take them to court,” he assured. Buhari who was in Calabar, Cross River State said, “Those that will be able to give honest assessment within the country and outside can attest to the fact that we have made greater achievements during our administration in the last four years.” I will continue to reposition police, judiciary – Buhari Page 18 How Buhari can win the anti-corruption war – Prof Oyebode
