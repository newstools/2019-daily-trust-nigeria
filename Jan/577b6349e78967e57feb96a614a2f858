Governor Aminu Masari of Katsina State, yesterday, unveiled his second tenure blueprint for the state christened ‘Restoration Agenda II: Strategic Consolidation’. Masari said the blueprint was aimed at consolidating the gains of his first tenure. The document was launched few days after he launched his second term bid in Funtua town which had in attendance the National Chairman of the APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and multitude of supporters from within and outside Katsina State. Speaking at unveiling of the blueprint yesterday, Masari said the project was carefully drafted to address some of the shortcomings of the Restoration Agenda 1 which were caused by the harsh economic and financial climate that befell the nation. According to him, the administration was forced to also confront the burden of the geometrically expanding quantum of challenges and needs of a demographically expanding citizenry especially youth and women. He said the administration, not withstanding, was able to perform excellently well in its key areas of health, education, agriculture and empowerment, adding that it intended to consolidate on the gains during the second phase if re-elected. “This second segment represents the final charge to accomplish the vestige targets and uncompleted goals and objectives of Restoration Agenda I,” he said. “The overall mission of the second phase is restoring Katsina back to its glories,” the governor said.
