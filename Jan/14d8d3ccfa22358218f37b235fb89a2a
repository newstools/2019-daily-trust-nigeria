Theatre Command, Operations Lafiya Dole has solicited for credible information from the populace around Maiduguri city about fleeing suspected Boko haram insurgents who were threatening innocent civilians to vacate their homes. This Army made this plea in an electronic statement issued by Deputy Director of Public Relations, Theatre Command, Operation Lafiya Dole, Col. Onyema Nwachukwu to newsmen in Maiduguri on Thursday. The statement read: “There is credible information and evidence that, in a bid to further intensify their psychological war and instill fear on the citizens, some elements of Boko Haram terrorists have infiltrated some villages in the fringes of Maiduguri city. They have clandestinely been going about threatening innocent residents, warning them to vacate their homes. “So far, out of fear, several inhabitants have moved out of their ancestral homes. Consequently, we wish to inform all well meaning citizens, especially within Maiduguri metropolis and its environs to promptly report the presence of suspicious persons or avail the security agencies of information about such persons. “Failure to report will be viewed seriously as it is tantamount to collaboration with the Boko Haram terrorists. Such compromising persons, when found, will be treated like the terrorists. “Members of the public are enjoined to please cooperate and support ongoing operations to weed out the infiltrating terrorists and their sympathisers,” the statement said.
