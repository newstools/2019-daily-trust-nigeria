Zimbabwe’s army said on Thursday soldiers accused of beating residents in townships following protests over fuel price hikes were impostors who tarnished the name of the military. Security forces have been cracking down on violent demonstrations that erupted last week after President Emmerson Mnangagwa decreed a sharp increase in the price of fuel. Rights groups say a dozen people have died in the unrest, though police put the figure at three. In an echo of tactics used during the 37-year rule of Robert Mugabe, soldiers have been accused of night raids, and beating residents and activists, in the townships. Zimbabwe National Army spokesman Alphios Makotore said those involved were not bona fide soldiers. “The Zimbabwe National Army has noted with concern allegations of misconduct and acts of violence by people purporting to be members of the organization,” he said. “The actions by these bogus elements have subsequently put the image of the organization into disrepute,” his statement added, urging residents to report violations to military police.
