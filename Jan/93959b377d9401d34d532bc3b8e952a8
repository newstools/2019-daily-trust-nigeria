The Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room has demanded that the Independence National Electoral Commission (INEC) ensure unfettered access for accredited observers and all party agents at collation centres during the general elections. Situation Room, a collaboration of over 70 Civil Society organisations (CSOs), working in support of credible and transparent election, made this call on Tuesday as part of its outlined thresholds for the 2019 General Elections for the election to be regarded as credible. The convener, Clement Nwankwo, who is also the Executive Director of Policy and Legal Advocacy Centre (PLAC), added that INEC must also ensure the non-participation of security agents in collation process at any level. He said all security agencies must ensure that their deployment must be under the operational directive of INEC and that security agencies make a public declaration of neutrality before, during and after the elections. The group also called on all political parties to ensure compliance with election laws and regulations, shun hate speech and violence during campaigns and avoid perpetrating malpractices on Election Day.
