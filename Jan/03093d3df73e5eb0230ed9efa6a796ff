The Weights and Measures Department of the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment has said it has the capacity to generate N5 billion annually should government put all necessary modalities in place to enhance its activities. The director of the department, Engr Mohammed Sada Sidi, disclosed this in Abuja during an interactive session with journalists. Sidi said the department, which is saddled with the responsibility of verifying weight and measure instruments used for trade in Nigeria, needed at least N1 billion allocation from government and the retention of a percentage of its generated revenue to effectively carry out its mandate. He said such money would be used to procure all relevant machines and engage more personnel to achieve its capacity of generating N5 billion to the Federal Governmentâ€™s coffers every year. He said it is no longer tenable, a situation where penalty prescribed in the existing Act is N500 fine or one year prison sentence for an individual defaulter and N5,000 for a corporate body.
