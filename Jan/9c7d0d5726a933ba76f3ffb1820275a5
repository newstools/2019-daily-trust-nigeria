The governorship candidate of Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Ogun State, Rotimi Paseda has blamed Governor Ibikunle Amosun- led government for water scarcity in some parts of the state. He said the administration, when it came on board in 2011, “cut off pipes supplying water into the households in the name of road construction.” To this end, he promised to revamp the State Water Corporation to make portable water accessible to all and sundry in the state. Paseda, who was Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN) governorship candidate in 2015, spoke at Ijebu-Atan in Ijebu North-East Area of Ogun State as part of his campaign rallies across the state. He frowned at the suffering of the people in search of drinkable water in the State due to scarcity of water in the dry season. Paseda assured electorates in the state of his determined effort to eradicate water scarcity by providing pipe borne water across the state. “Obviously, there is sheer lack of portable water in the state for about seven years now. When APC government came to power in 2011 in the state, it cut off the pipe supplying water to every household and communities in the state due to road construction. “But as soon as the government completed the road construction in some communities, it failed to re-connect the pipes to make the residents have access to drinkable water. This is sad, water that is a natural resources has now been come a costly commodity,” he said. 2019: Amosun's govt debts won't deter us from developing Ogun - Paseda No foreigner will get contract in Ogun in my time - SDP Guber Candidate 2019: Bankole, Odebiyi, Adebutu, others jostle to replace Amosun
