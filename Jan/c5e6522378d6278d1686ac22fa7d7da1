The Peoples Democratic Party Presidential Campaign Organisation (PPCO) has asked chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, to rejig the 2019 electoral guidelines and resist pressure allegedly from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Presidency to compromise the electoral process. The director, Media and Publicity of the PPCO, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, who addressed a press conference, yesterday, in Abuja, said the guidelines should be rejigged in a way that accreditation must be concluded first and number of accredited voters ascertained and openly announced before the actual voting. Mr. Ologbondiyan said doing accreditation and voting simultaneously at the polling units as planned by INEC would validate the alleged position of Nigerians that the electoral empire had been compromised by the APC. The PPCO also claimed that the process of employing ad hoc staff as electoral officers, particularly in the presidential election had already been compromised, adding that the commission must publish the list of ad hoc staff recruited for the exercise for transparency. “We challenge INEC Chairman Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, to rise above the manifest compromises and conduct the 2019 general elections in a transparent manner. “Presently, more than half of the card readers to be used in the elections have been rendered obsolete and non-functional. We have less that 30 days to the elections and these card readers have not been upgraded. We have it on good authority that these will be used to create confusion on election days and facilitate the use of incident form, which will hamper transparency,” the PDP spokesman alleged.
