The presidency has said there was no plan to arrest the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) , Justice Walter Onnoghen over non-declaration of asset. Presidential spokesperson, Femi Adesina, described as fake news, the reports by the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) that plans have been concluded to arrest the CJN and frame three other Supreme Court Justices. “We have read with considerable concern and surprise, the fake news of the Presidency’s alleged plan to arrest the Chief Justice of Nigeria and frame three other Supreme Court Justices. “This false story is being peddled by the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) apparently to set the Judiciary against the Executive and cause major confusion ahead of the forthcoming general elections,” he said. He said the story was absolutely false as the Presidency is not in any way involved in plotting against or framing anybody. Adesina noted that the findings of the Code of Conduct Bureau against the CJN and the allegations arising from them are being handled by the courts in the normal way, as is expected in a democratic society. “The Presidency has not, and will certainly not, interfere in the process,” he said. He added that “We, however, want to draw the attention of the general public to this or similar false stories, which are ill-motivated to further the political interests of their sponsors. “While the Buhari administration is very firmly committed to the fight against corruption, we want to assure the general public that government will always pursue its mission with the highest standards of fairness, and in strict conformity with the relevant laws.” Due process not followed in Onnoghen case - CUPP CUPP condemns trial of CJN, alleges APC plans to manipulate 2019 elections CCT: Non-declaration of asset a mistake, funds are from my estacodes - CJN Onnoghen
