A former Senate Minority Leader, Senator Godswill Akpabio, during the weekend in Ibadan, said despite opposition parties’ antics, President Muhammadu Buhari will win the February 16 presidential election. Akpabio, who is also the chairman of Presidential Support Committee (PSC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC), said he was going to ensure he delivered 10 million votes for President Buhari. The former governor of Akwa Ibom, who spoke at the inauguration of the South West and states’ coordinators of the committee, held at the premier hotel, Ibadan noted that God had guaranteed victory for the APC presidential candidate and his vice, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, in the election. He said the group, at various local and state government levels across the country, had continued to mop-up support for the re-election of the APC presidential candidate, based on his achievements in the last three and half years. He further said Nigerians had found in Buhari, a leader committed and dedicated to the struggle to bring about the desired change in the polity. “We are at various wards and local government, moving on daily basis, working for the re-election of President Buhari, Vice President Osinbajo and APC. Since campaign has started, God has guaranteed victory for APC and President Buhari in 2019 general elections. “We are already winning because we are the champions. This is because we have seen a man who wants to bring change. We have seen a man who has brought back respect for the country and its people. “Opposition may say whatever they want, but I believe in transitional leadership, represented by President Buhari,” he said, as he urged the people of the South West to continue to work for the continued progress of the country.
