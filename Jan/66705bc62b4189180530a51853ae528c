A second Republic Governor of Borno State, Alhaji Mohammed Goni has announced his defection to the All Progressives Congress (APC) from the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP). Goni, who was the governorship candidate of the PDP in 2011, announced his defection after meeting President Muhammadu Buhari together with some North East politicians including Senator Ali Ndume, a former Senate leader. The former governor told State House Correspondents that he defected to the APC to support the second term bid of President Buhari. He said he decided to support the re-election of Buhari because of his commitment to the fight against insurgency and the development of the country. Goni, who said Borno State and the entire Northeast was doomed if President Buhari is defeated in the forthcoming election, assured that he would mobilise for the President’s re-election.
