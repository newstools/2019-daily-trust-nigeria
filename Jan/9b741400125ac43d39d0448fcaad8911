A Federal High Court in Abuja has fixed February 4 for hearing on a fresh suit by a civil society organization seeking an order to remove the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidate, President Muhammadu Buhari, from the ballot paper for the general elections. The Incorporated Trustees of the Civil Society Observatory for Constitutional and Legal Compliance (CSOCLC) had on January 15 filed the action against INEC, the APC and President Buhari. In a motion on notice for injunction and accelerated hearing filed on Wednesday, SCOCLC, through its counsel, Nnamdi Ahaiwe, submitted that Buhari was not eligible to stand for election to the office of president. It said Buhari had not provided proof such as First School Leaving Certificate or WASC to INEC as required by law as requirement for the election and made false statement to the first defendant which disqualified him.
