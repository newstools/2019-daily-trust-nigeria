The Police Service Commission (PSC) has said it will sanction erring police officers who show misconducts or unprofessionalism during the forthcoming general elections. The Commission also expressed commitment that the Police would maintain the highest professional standard as it has done in the past to ensure free and fair elections next month. The Commissioner representing Human Rights, North Central of the PSC, Rommy Mom, stated this at a workshop for police officers from Plateau, Kwara and Niger states on “The Role and Duties of the Police during the General Elections” in Jos on Thursday. Mom said the aim of the training was to improve on the role of the police during the elections in Ekiti and Osun states and to ensure the credibility of the electoral process. He said the PSC will set up smaller teams in every state to work with the police headquarters to synergies and coordinate the Police network during the elections. “We shall not hesitate to sanction erring police officers because we want to maintain our standard in protecting democracy especially since the police force is the largest and leading agency providing 85% of the security personnel for the 2019 elections,” he said. On his part, the Plateau State Commissioner of Police, Austin Agbonlahor said the essence of the training was to remind the police officers of the task ahead of them and urged them to show good conduct during elections.
