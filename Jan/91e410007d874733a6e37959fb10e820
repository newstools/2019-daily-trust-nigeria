A 36-year-old Sokoto-based entrepreneur, Umar Idris, has floated an online platform aimed at marketing local products produced in the state, to the world. Idris, a holder of National Diploma in Business Administration and founder of the 21st Century Entrepreneurs Hub, lamented that the state was lagging behind in entrepreneurship despites its potentials. “We have local products in different varieties but our people do not know how to showcase them to the world. So the platform which we named Gizo Market will help show the world our potentials and, at the same time market our products to them,” he said. According to him, his company has been collaborating with the pet project of the former Commissioner for Health in the state, Dr. Balarabe Kakale,  to train young entrepreneurs on how best they could market their products. “So far we have, together, created a working space, where our members and other entrepreneurs can come and work in a shared space and learn from each other and the space was provided with internet facility and uninterrupted power supply. We have also organize different workshops for youth particularly, women on how they could transform their petty businesses,” he said. Idris said 380 entrepreneurs had benefitted from the training. “We taught them how to start a business right from the business plan, registration with regulatory bodies, accessing bank loans among others,” he added. He noted that the state hosted a global entrepreneurship week in November last year during which local products were exhibited. Idris appealed to the state government to support entrepreneurship to thrive in the state through financial support and enabling laws.
