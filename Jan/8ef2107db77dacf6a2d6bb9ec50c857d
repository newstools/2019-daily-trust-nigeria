An average of six migrants died crossing the Mediterranean every day last year, a UN report says. Italy had earlier highlighted the lower overall number of deaths last year, due to fewer people making the crossing. But the rate of deaths from Libya rose to one for every 14 arrivals in 2018 – from one in 38 the year before. The report came as seven European countries agreed to end a row over 47 rescued migrants, stranded on a humanitarian boat for 12 days. “It is likely that reductions to search and rescue capacity coupled with an uncoordinated and unpredictable response to disembarkation led to an increased death rate,” the report said. An estimated 2,275 people died making the journey in 2018 – an average of more than six every day. The death toll was particularly high on the route to Spain, where it was more than four times the 2017 figure.
