British victims of forced marriages overseas are being asked by the Foreign Office to pay costs associated with their own rescue, it has been revealed. An investigation by the Times found those unable to cover flights, food and shelter were made to take out a loan. MPs have condemned the practice as “astonishing” and “immoral”. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he wanted the matter looked into and all British officials abroad should act with “compassion and humanity”. According to the report in the Times, British victims of forced marriage who ask for help abroad are informed about the costs. It has confirmed that between 2016 and 2017, 82 people were repatriated with the support of the government’s Forced Marriage Unit and up to 12 loans were granted. The Times said a Freedom of Information request showed the Foreign Office loaned £7,765 to at least eight victims in the past two years.
