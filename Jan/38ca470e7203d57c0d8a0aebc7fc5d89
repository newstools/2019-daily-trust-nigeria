The National Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Uche Secondus, said yesterday that the “cabal” in the current government wants to kill President Muhammadu  Buhari. Secondus who inaugurated a 27-man sub-committee of the PDP Presidential Campaign Organization (PPCO) in Abuja, said the APC bigwigs were “deceiving” the president to seek a second term and were “overworking” him instead of asking him to rest. He said Nigeria was sliding into a state of anarchy under the current government and called on INEC and security agencies to remain neutral in the presidential poll. He warned that there would be crisis in the country if INEC fails to conduct a credible election. “We are pained about the way the cabal is mounting pressure on the president. You are aware of what happened in Kogi, you are aware of what happened during the interview. You can see that the president is under stress, is under immense pressure from the leadership of the APC,” he added. 2019: Cabal wants to kill Buhari - Secondus APC government filled with cabals - Secondus Buhari should probe Jonathan over arms deal – Gulak
