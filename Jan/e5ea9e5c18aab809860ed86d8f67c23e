The Head of Public Health at the Federal Teaching Hospital, Gombe, Abu-Ubaida Mu’azu has cautioned members of the public on the dangers of self-medication. Mu’azu who said this in an interview with North East Trust yesterday in Gombe, advised against the bad habit of taking drugs without doctor’s prescription. He said self-medication could endanger people’s health, especially during the harmattan season when people usually experience headache, cold, catarrh and other health related problems. He, therefore, called on people to always consult qualified medical practitioners whenever they feel unwell. The head of public health further advised members of the public to avoid using cold water while taking bath and take warm liquid  tea regularly to reduce the effect of the cold weather in their body during the harmattan. Mu’azu also advised people living with pneumonia, sickle cell and asthma to avoid exposure to cold, dust and make sure they take their drugs on time. “People should use appropriate dressing, mind the normal medication you are using and ensure sleeping under treated mosquito net at all time to protect them from malaria,” he said. He further advised pregnant mothers to attend antenatal clinics, and ensure personal hygiene.
