The military in oil-rich Gabon is saying it has seized power from the President Ali Bongo-led government in the country. The BBC reports that soldiers in the African country said they launched a coup to restore democracy. They took control of the national radio station in the early hours of Monday to read a short statement announcing a “National Restoration Council”. The BBC also reported that tanks and armed vehicles were on the streets of the capital Libreville. President Bongo took over power in 2009. He reportedly suffered a stroke in October and received treatment in Morocco. Mr Bongo sought to put an end to the rumours about his health with a New Year message in which he said he was feeling fine. Soldiers said they had been disappointed by the message, calling it “a pitiful sight” and a “relentless attempt to cling onto power.” Africa’s longest-serving leaders Turkey: Troubled by ghosts of a coup attempt Burkina Faso’s coup and peoples’ power in W/Africa
