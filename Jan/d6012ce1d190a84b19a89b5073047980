A pro Buhari group, the United Niger Delta for Buhari, UNDB, says that it is targeting about three million votes for President Muhammadu Buhari in next month’s Presidential election. The Chairman of the group, Chief Anabs Sara Igbe, who disclosed this to Journalists shortly after the inauguration of the association in Port Harcourt at the weekend, said that the group, through issue-based campaign, will ensure that it delivered 500,000 votes from each of the six States of Niger Delta region. Chief Igbe said that the group will carry out an intensive and aggressive strategic campaign through road works and door-to-door campaign to convince the people of Niger Delta on the need to re-elect Buhari for second term. He said that President Buhari had salable points in Niger Delta given his impeccable achievements in the region. He said that most of the strategic ministries in Buhari’s administration were occupied by the people of Niger Delta, saying that President Buhari will do more if the people of the region were fully integrated to the centre by voting en-mass for him in February, 16th, 2019 Presidential election. Chief Igbe said “the aim of the United Niger Delta for Buhari, UNDB, is to integrate the region to the centre through our massive votes for President Muhammadu Buhari in February, 16th, 2019. “With the crowd you saw at the inuguaration of this group in Port Harcourt today, you will be convinced that Buhari will make a good inroad in Niger Delta come February, 16th, 2019” “The membership of the group are drawn from the six States that make up the Niger Delta region. We are working very hard to ensure that we deliver at least 3,000,000 votes for Buhari from Niger Delta. “Our calculation is that we will target 500,000 votes from each of the six States of Niger Delta and when you put together it will give us 3,000,000 votes” Buhari organisation thumbs up Niger Delta youth for endorsement Buhari needs support not threat — VON DG Niger delta leaders condemn Niger Delta Avenger
