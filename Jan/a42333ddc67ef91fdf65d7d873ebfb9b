The National Council of State (NCS), chaired by President Muhammadu Buhari, has expressed satisfaction on the level of preparedness for the general elections by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Former President Olusegun Obasanjo had on Sunday said he doubted INEC’s integrity, impartiality and competence to conduct a fair, free and credible election. Ondo State Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, told State House correspondents on the outcome of the meeting yesterday that INEC chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, took the council through all the processes to be followed at the national and state elections. “In his briefing, he informed the council of the preparedness of INEC and everybody in the council was convinced that INEC was ready for this election. And a lot of things have been put in place and I think we all concluded that it is important for the chairman to even speak to the nation on the preparedness of INEC for this election. That would convince all of us that this forthcoming election would be free and fair,” he said. He said INEC chairman told the council that the money appropriated had been given to them and that they were ready for the elections. “So, everybody was convinced. INEC as at today is ready for election and questions were put, he was interrogated, he responded and gave adequate explanations to the satisfaction of every one of us,” he said. The Council of State comprises the President (Chairman), Vice-President, (Deputy Chairman), all former Presidents/Heads of the Government, all former Chief Justices of Nigeria, Senate President,  House of Representatives Speaker, State Governors and Attorney-General of the Federation.
