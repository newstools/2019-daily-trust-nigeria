Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has suspended its presidential campaign following the suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) Walter Onnoghen by President Muhammadu Buhari. A statement by the PDP National Chairman and co-Chairman of the PDP Presidential Campaign Organisation, Prince Uche Secondus said the decision was in protest of the “illegal” suspension of the CJN. The party’s campaign team was to visit Benue State today, but the PDP said the campaign would be suspended for 72 hours in the first instance. Secondus further said the suspension of the party’s campaign activities was in solidarity with Nigerians in the “collective rejection of the assault” against the democratic order. The PDP helmsman described President Buhari’s action as dangerous and brazen assault on the nation’s constitution.
“The basis for this election is the democracy itself. When democracy comes under this kind of virulent attack, then the election itself becomes superfluous. “The PDP Presidential Campaign was scheduled to be in Benue State on Saturday. But it now said it is suspending its campaign activities for a period of 72 hours in the first instance. “It is our hope that President Buhari will listen to the voice of all lovers of democracy the world over and restore democracy in Nigeria immediately and without qualifications. At the moment, the President has effectively suspended the constitution under whose basis the elections are being contested. “The action of President Buhari represents a constitutional breach and a direct attack on our democracy. This must never be allowed to stand, as there is no way by which democracy can survive under these autocratic tendencies. “We call on all well meaning Nigerians to rise in defence of democracy and save our nation from this imminent slide into tyranny,” Secondus said.
