The police have arraigned a businessman, Abraham Moses, for allegedly converting the sum of N200,000 meant for his neighbour’s house rent to personal use. Moses, who lives on Ajegunle Road, Mpape, Abuja, is facing a two-count charge of criminal breach of trust and cheating before a Wuse Zone 6 Chief Magistrates’ Court, Abuja. The prosecutor, Emmanuel Ochai, told the court that one Onyedika Paul of same address, on Nov. 22 reported the matter at the Metro Area Command, Abuja. According to Ochai, the complainant alleged that the defendant claimed to be the agent in charge of a self-contained apartment and that he gave him the sum of N200, 000 meant for rent of the apartment. The prosecutor said the defendant refused to allow the complainant take possession of the apartment and converted the money to his personal use. The offence, he said, contravened the provisions of sections 312 and 322 of the Penal Code. Moses, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The magistrate, Njideka Nwosu-Iheme, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N500, 000 with one surety in like sum. The case was adjourned until January 16, 2019 for hearing. (NAN)
