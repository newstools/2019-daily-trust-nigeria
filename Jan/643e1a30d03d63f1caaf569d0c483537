The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), under its Transmission Rehabilitation and Expansion Programme, has raised over $1.624bn to boost power supply in the country. This was disclosed by the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of TCN, Mr Usman Gur Mohammed, during the official commissioning of a 60MVA transformer at Dan-Agundi transmission substation, yesterday, in Kano. The MD said part of the amount was $486 million from the World Bank which is targeting existing substations and existing lines across the country aimed at achieving what he called N-1 redundancy criteria. “N-1 redundancy criteria means upgrading transmission substations in such a way that if one transformer is faulty or goes out of service, that does not affect the supply of the substation,” he explained Under the programme, the MD said, Kano and its environs will receive one 300mva transformer at Kumbotso substation and one 100mva transformer at Dakata and Dan-Agundi substations each. In a related development, TCN has commissioned a 30/40mva transformer at Wudil substation in Wudil Local Government, Kano State.
