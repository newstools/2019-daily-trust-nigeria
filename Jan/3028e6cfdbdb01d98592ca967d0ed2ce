The Nigerian Navy has handed over 19 suspects and two fibre boats allegedly laden with petroleum products to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for further investigation and prosecution. The suspects are Ayeni John, Adetini Ademola, Saliu Malik, Emmanuel Tosu, Emopin Moneyin, Malade Aiyetimiyi, Oduroja Ojune, Ikudehinbu Idowu, Abogun Ota, Elamah Augustine and Olarotimi Elikanah. Others are ThankGod Benjamin, Abbas Friday, Victor Goldsmith, Gbenga Thomas, Ibane Austin, Idowu Surprise, Asemia Thomas and Agbayoh Lawrence. The suspects, arrested on August 30, 2018 in Lagos and some parts of Ondo State, were alleged to be involved in illegal dealings in petroleum products sourced from a hijacked vessel, MT Mama Elizabeth. The sum of N3.5 million, suspected to be proceeds from the sale of the illegally acquired products, was said to have been found on the suspects at the point of arrest. An investigator with the EFCC, Idris Abdullahi Abubakar, who received the suspects and the boats on behalf of the Commission, assured the Nigerian Navy of diligent investigation and prosecution of the suspects. He said the suspects would be arraigned in court as soon as investigation was concluded.
