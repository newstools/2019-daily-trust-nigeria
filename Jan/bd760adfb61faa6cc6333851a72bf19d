The southern African regional body SADC has called for a unity government in the Democratic Republic of Congo, following the disputed presidential election. All political leaders should agree a negotiated settlement, it said. Opposition candidate Felix Tshisekedi was declared winner but another opponent of the current administration, Martin Fayulu, insists he won. On Saturday, Mr Fayulu filed an appeal in the Constitutional Court demanding a manual recount of votes cast in the 30 December election.  This call was supported by SADC in its statement issued by Zambian President Edgar Lungu, who is the body’s current chairman. He and other regional leaders felt the best way forward was a negotiated political settlement and a government of national unity, Mr Lungu said. He cited the example of similar deals in Zimbabwe and Kenya. South Africa’s Foreign Minister, Lindiwe Sisulu, also said a unity government could prove to be an acceptable compromise for a troubled country in desperate need of peace.
