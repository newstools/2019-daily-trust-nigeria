Months after the completion of primary elections, some aggrieved PDP faithful who pride themselves as “Loyal Members of PDP” have called for the cancellation of the whole exercise in Bayelsa State on the grounds that the process was skewed in favour of Governor Seriake Dickson’s allies. According to them, the call coming less than two months to the general elections was to ensure that PDP continued with its firm grip of the state but added that that could only be achieved when relevant stakeholders put the house together urgently. In a petition to the National Chairman of PDP, Chief Uche Secondus, signed by Amb. Kenny Sotonye Fiseye and seven other members of the group, which was made available to newsmen in Yenagoa, the group threatened to dump the party and support any other opposition party if the leadership of PDP did not hearken to their plea. They condemned what they called “The purported October 2018 national and state assembly primaries which the National Working Committee appointed Hon. Williams Alamene to conduct in Bayelsa State” According to the petition, “The so-called primary election which produced all the current candidates of the party, who coincidentally were handpicked by the Bayelsa State Governor Honourable Henry Seriake Dickson, was nothing but a mockery of democracy and a charade of the equitable process of electing people to represent the people and the interest of the party.”
