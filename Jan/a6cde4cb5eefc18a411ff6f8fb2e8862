The PDP in Katsina State has flagged off its presidential and gubernatorial campaigns with the promise of reintroducing policies and programmes of its past governors, late Umaru Yar’adua and Ibrahim Shehu Shema. Speaking at the launch, its gubernatorial candidate, Sen. Yakubu Lado, said these “two great sons” of the party had laid a solid blueprint for growth and development of the state which the APC administration allegedly abandoned. According to him, free education, job creation and security which were enjoyed in the past were no more, adding that “within 100 days in office, the PDP will restore security which the present administration has admitted it can’t provide.” In his remarks, the leader of the party in the state and former governor, Ibrahim Shema, said the 2019 election was about the future of the country adding that “Katsina people can visibly see the difference from the two administrations.” He said it was time the electorate faced the reality and stopped living by hope, alleging that “all the juicy promises made by the APC cannot be seen on ground.” PDP launches campaign in Katsina, vows to reintroduce late Yaradua's, Shema blueprints Katsina guber: A race largely in the realm of speculation Why we support Shema for 2011 - Katsina PDP
