A former governor of Sokoto state, Attahiru Bafarawa, has promised to give the sum of N50 million to any zone that gives the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) the highest votes in the state. Also, a business mogul in the state, Alhaji Umarun Kwabo promised the zone a brand new jeep while the Director General, PDP’s Presidential and Gubernatorial campaign committee, Muntari Maigona pledged the sum of N10 million to the zone, if the electorate vote massively for PDP. The trio made the promises at the zonal campaign rally held in Bodinga local government area of the state. Bafarawa said he was supporting Governor Tambuwal’s re-election bid because the governor meant well for the state. In his remarks, Governor Tambuwal promised to construct 5,000 kilometres feeder roads across the state in collaboration with World Bank. He also promised to provide portable water to nooks and crannies of the state as well as farming inputs to farmers at very subsidized rate. The governor who thanked the mammoth crowd at the rally urged supporters of the party to embark on ward-to-ward and house-to-house campaigns. Can Sokoto PDP weather the storm?
