The quick passage of the National Transport Commission (NTC) bill will solve most of the problems in the sector, the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT), Nigeria has said. Towards this end, the group has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to assent to the bill to save the sector from collapse. Speaking at the CILT Leadership Impact Programme (CLIP) and induction of new council executives in Lagos, the president of the institute, Ibrahim Jubril, urged government and the private sector to ensure the passage of the bill. Jubril, who added that there are enormous benefits in the passage of the bill, said it would solve most transportation problems in the country. He said: “Definitely, the NTC will solve most of the problems in the commercial area because it is going to be a commercial regulator and in that case most of our transportation problems will be solved. “We need so much of regulation in the industry so that we can have better transportation system, more efficient transportation system and we can have transport systems that are compatible with every other transport system in the world. “Though, the NTC is awaiting the assent of President Muhammadu Buhari, when it is eventually assented to, it will help the industry greatly.” Jubril also urged all stakeholders in the maritime industry to collaborate to end the continuous traffic situation along Oshodi/Apapa Expressway and the adjoining roads within Apapa.
