The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, has described the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) as a sinking boat that is out to destroy Nigeria. He therefore called on the people of the South-east zone to vote out the party for the good of Nigerians and generations yet unborn. Speaking at the South East zonal  presidential rally, held at the Dan Anyiam Stadium Owerri, on Tuesday, he alleged that APC was planning to rig the 2019 elections and advised that the only way to stop that was for the electorate to protect their votes. He also said that APC has impoverished Nigerians. Atiku said: “We are going to take over the state in the next election. Immediately after voting, stay there and protect your votes. “APC is planning to rig the election. Please protect your votes. We have promised to restructure this country. APC is an evil party. They have turned this country into headquarters of poverty. “We want the economy to start growing again. We want you to vote PDP at all levels. Let nobody deceive you.” Also speaking, the vice presidential candidate of the PDP, Peter Obi, said: “South-east will follow Atiku; he is the one to develop Igboland. He has promised us restructuring. He will revamp the economy of Nigeria. Igbo people will vote Atiku Abubakar.” In his remarks, Senate President Bukola Saraki, said he was happy to be part of the revolution in the entire south-east zone. He expressed pleasure that the zone would be part of the making of Atiku as the next president. He added, “Let me tell you, he has the capacity to make Nigeria united. I know that Nigerians are not happy the way it is now. Believe me, Atiku will solve our whole problems.” Atiku, Secondus to electorate in Nasarawa: PDP will crush Boko Haram, end unemployment Buhari failed to deliver his mandate – Atiku How Atiku emerged as Buhari’s main challenger
