The House of Representatives candidate for the Ogbia Federal Constituency in Bayelsa, Chief Samuel Ogbuku, has advised the PDP-led government in the state to stop creating distractions with unsubstantiated allegations that former President Goodluck Jonathan is supporting him to win the election. Ogbuku, said in a statement issued in Abuja that the insinuations that the former President and his wife were backing his candidacy were baseless. Chief Ogbuku, who urged the PDP to focus on how to redeem its fast declining image, also implored them to desist from creating distractions for the APC. The candidate, who said they had respect for the first family, added that there was nothing to suggest Jonathanâ€™s support for the party. He said the PDP was being haunted by its decision to impose candidates on the people the area.
