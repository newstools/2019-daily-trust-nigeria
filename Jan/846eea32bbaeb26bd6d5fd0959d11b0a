The Lagos state governorship candidate for Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr Jimi Agbaje, has said that he would solve the epileptic power supply in Lagos with generation of 1,000MW in 18 months of assumption of office. Besides, the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu on his part promise to take the state out of national grid with sufficient electricity generation from the state’s power plants. The two leading governorship candidates were the guests of organized private sector in the state organized by the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) in Lagos on Friday to showcase their economic agenda for the state. Agbaje who is contesting for the position on third consecutive times said: “I will improve power in Lagos state by generating 1,000mw from straddled and embedded power within 18 months of our government. We believe this will encourage private sector to invest more in the economy of Lagos”, he said Agbaje noted that the state will have a dedicated gas storage for power plants adding that once there is power failure on the grid, the state will switch to its gas plants. He noted that about 15,000mw of embedded power is being held by private companies and that his government will rally private sector to ensure that 1,000mw of the power is put into use. Babajide Sanwo-Olu on his part, said with 1,000Mw, Lagos will be sufficiently powered adding that he had commenced talks with Ikeja and Eko Electricity Distribution Companies on how electricity can be improved in the state Few people should no longer determine who governs Lagos - Agbaje Agbaje too inexperienced to handle N500bn economy – Ambode Lagos guber: How Sanwo-Olu will lock horns with Agbaje in 2019
