The Chief Executive Officer of NSE, Mr. Oscar N. Onyema, has said swift approval and implementation of the 2019 budget will have a positive impact on companies’ earnings as well as consumer spending. Onyema said this at the Nigerian Stock Exchange 2018 Market Recap and Outlook for 2019, yesterday, at the Stock Exchange House, Marina, Lagos. This annual event is a forum to brief the stockbroking community, analysts, media and other stakeholders, on the performance of the market in the preceding year and give prognosis for the market for the new year 2019. Speaking on the outlook for 2019, Onyema noted that the market sentiments in the first half of the year will be driven by uncertainty in oil prices as well as the 2019 general elections. “Accordingly, we anticipate volatility in the equities markets in the first half of 2019, with enhanced stability post-elections. “Therefore, we expect an uptick in market activity during the second half of 2019,” he added. Mr. Onyema stated that the Nigerian economy continued its path of recovery, growing by 1.81% year on year in real terms as at the third quarter of 2018. The recovery was bolstered by increased stability in the macro environment as the CBN continued to pursue a relatively tight policy stance in an effort to curtail inflation while holding the benchmark rate steady at 14.00%; and effectively maintained liquidity and stability in the foreign exchange market during the year.
