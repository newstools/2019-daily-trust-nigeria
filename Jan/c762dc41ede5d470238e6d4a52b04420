Three journalists from different media organisations, who were caught during the pandemonium that broke out at the APC campaign flag-off in Lagos on Tuesday, have been confirmed to sustain varying degree of injuries through stray bullets. Among those that were hit by bullets were the Group Political Editor of The Nation newspaper, Emmanuel Oladesu; News Telegraph correspondent, Temitope Ogunbanke, and Ibile Television cameraman, Abiodun Yusuf. Narrating his experience, Ogunbanke said he was lucky to have sustained minor injury on his cheek even when he also felt bullet hits in his abdomen. “I escaped two bullets in my face and stomach. One of the bullets scratched my cheek, hence the plaster I got. “I thank God that I am alive. When I felt the bullet in my stomach, I thought I was dead. It was when I open my eyes and touch the stomach and saw no blood that I knew I was still alive,” Ogunbanke said. Oladesu is said to be recuperating in an undisclosed hospital while the whereabouts of Yusuf is unknown.
