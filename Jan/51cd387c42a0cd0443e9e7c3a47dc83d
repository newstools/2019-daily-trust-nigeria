The FCT Administration has called on political parties and their agents not to use public schools in the territory for the purpose of political campaigns and other partisan political activities. In a statement signed by the Education Secretariat’s spokesperson, Mr. Anthony Ogunleye, the administration said it would not tolerate the use of schools for political purpose in any guise or form. He added that the FCT education secretariat had a statutory responsibility to ensure the physical, emotional and mental wellbeing of the students and pupils under its care. “We caution all those planning to use our students or school premises for partisan political activities to, in their own interest, please, stay away. “Our principals and head teachers have also been advised not to grant any access whatsoever to any individual or organisation intending to use their schools or access the students for partisan political activities. “Any principal or head teacher that contravenes this directive will be sanctioned in accordance with the extant civil service rules and regulations. Any individual or group that wishes to access any public school in the FCT for whatever reason should first seek permission from the Office of the Secretary for Education,” Ogunleye said.
