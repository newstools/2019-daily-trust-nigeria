The leadership of Kogi west senatorial district has described the alleged move to extend the tenure of Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris and alleged insistence by INEC to have President Buhari’s niece, Amina Zakari as head of INEC ad hoc committee on National Collation Centre as part of the “grand plot” by the APC-led federal government to “rig the elections at all costs”. This allegation was contained in a communique issued to the press at the end of their meeting held over the weekend at Iyah-Gbedde, Ijumu Local Government. The communique reads in parts “We are taking these matters seriously because we cannot fool ourselves that we are comfortable. In view of our state of helplessness, we urge our people to watch out for the possibility of election not holding at all, and if election holds eventually, results may not be declared. “Also, the tendency of inconclusive election cannot be ruled out at any time under this regime, and if election is declared and the result does not favour APC, will they be prepared to hand over power? ” If we go to court, will they allow the judiciary to play its role? This is why we told our people to pray fervently, for our distinguished Senator Dino Melaye. “Our people are resolute that just like the recall exercise failed, they will return senator Dino Melaye in the February 16 election whether he is released from detention or not. “Fortunately enough, he does not have a competitor. We urge our people to pray fervently for Kogi West; to pray fervently for 2019 general elections and to pray fervently for the survival of Nigeria after the election”. 2019: INEC, Presidency setting stage for crisis over Zakari's new role - PPCO PDP raises alarm over plot to rig Lokoja/Kogi bye election PDP accuses APC of conniving with INEC to rig
