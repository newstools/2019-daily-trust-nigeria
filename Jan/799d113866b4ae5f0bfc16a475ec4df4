The wife of Kebbi State governor, Dr. Zainab Shinkafi Bagudu, has started what she calls ‘door to door campaign for the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari.’ Mrs. Bagudu, who was recently appointed as Women and Youth Presidential Campaign Coordinator for the North West zone, said at an interactive session with journalists at the government house in Birnin Kebbi that she would mobilise women and youth in the North West to overwhelmingly vote for Buhari in 2019. She said the APC would be capitalising on the numerical strength of women and youth in the area which constituted the highest voting groups. She harped on the records of achievements of President Buhari in infrastructural development such as roads and railway project, social intervention such as the N-power, the school feeding programme, agriculture, nutrition of children as well as the effort of his wife, Mrs. Aisha Buhari, to better the lives of women and children in the country. Dr Zainab said “We will meet people door to door to educate them, to showcase our achievements. We have already started our campaign to mobilise women and youths in the region to vote for Buhari and APC; some of our preparations are visible and some are not visible in order to win the 2019 election.”
