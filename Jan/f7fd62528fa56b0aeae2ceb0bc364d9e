President Muhammadu Buhari’s government should consider the security and unity of the nation’s ethnic nationalities, the national chairman of Social Democratic Party (SDP), Chief Olu Falae, has advised. Falae, in his New Year greetings, said the strength of mutual understanding and co-existence that made Nigerians rise and live together in peace and unity had been eroded by alleged mis-governance and lackadaisical attitude of past leaders towards addressing fundamental national questions. The SDP boss, in a statement issued by the party’s National Publicity Secretary, Alhaji Alfa Mohammed, urged President Buhari to jettison his personal interest for  the national and collective interest of Nigerians for the good of all. Falae, who lamented the killings of  Nigerian soldiers fighting insurgency in the North-East, implored Nigerians to pray fervently for the country.
