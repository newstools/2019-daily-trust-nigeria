Police yesterday said Senator Dino Melaye was moved from the Garki, Abuja police hospital to the Department of State Services Clinic in Abuja. A statement from police spokesman DCP Jimoh Moshood said Melaye is currently in police custody on a 14-day remand warrant obtained from the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court on January 9, 2019. Moshood said he was being investigated for criminal conspiracy and attempted culpable homicide, committed on July 18, 2018, when Melaye and armed thugs attacked police personnel, shot and wounded SGT Danjuma Saliu along Aiyetoro Gbede, Mopa Road in Kogi State. “The police medical team at the Police Hospital, Abuja certified that Senator Dino Melaye is well and healthy. However, due to the complaint from Senator Melaye that he was not well, the police investigation team has taken him this afternoon to another government hospital, the DSS medical facility in Abuja for further medical attention.” “Senator Melaye will be prosecuted along with other suspects on completion of investigation,” the police statement said.
