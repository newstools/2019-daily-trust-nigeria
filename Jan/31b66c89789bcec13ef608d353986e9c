A delegation of the European Union Election Observation Mission, yesterday, visited the court-recognised leadership of the APC in Kwara State led by Hon. Ishola Balogun-Fulani. The two-man delegation, made of Gabor Bash and Mashed Poulsen, arrived the party’s secretariat at about 1.00pm and was received by Balogun-Fulani, Chief Christopher Ayeni (secretary), Alh. Jimoh Balogun (Kwara South chairman) and other members of the party’s executive committee. While welcoming the team to Kwara State, Balogun-Fulani commended the observer mission which he noted had also visited the party’s national leadership. He used the occasion to express the insistence of his group on being the authentic leadership of the party in the state based on the subsisting court order, which he gave to the EU team to also study. He traced the history of the crisis in the party to the decision by its national leadership to dissolve the executive committee under him after they had been duly sworn in despite the fact that they did not show any sign of leaving the party. He said, “When they said they dissolved us, we said no, we are still in the party. That if we wanted to leave we would have formally communicated to the party. And instead of resorting to self-help, we went to the court to challenge what they had done. The court agreed with our position and gave us permission to conduct the primaries; which we did. “The problem, however, was that when INEC released the list of candidates, they didn’t use the names of our own people. Instead, they wrote ‘court ordered’ against the names of people from the other camp. And we are saying that it is wrong because we are the ones who have court order with us and in our favour.” The delegation later went into a meeting behind closed doors with the chairman and his group.
