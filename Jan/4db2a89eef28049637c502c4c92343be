The Police Service Commission says it has established a team to monitor the conduct of police personnel during the general elections. The PSC commissioner in charge of the South-south, Austin Braimoh, who disclosed this after  meeting with Governor Nyesom Wike in Port Harcourt yesterday,  said the action is aimed at checking negative attitude of police personnel during the elections. “We are mindful of the fact of that in every wrong activity during any election, the police are usually blamed.  The new board has deemed it necessary to go round the zones and sensitise that the commission will not fold its hands to watch the election manipulated,” he said. He added that the action became necessary as the police would contribute 80 percent of the security personnel for the elections.  He said a 12-point guideline has been drawn up to regulate the conduct of policemen. 2019 Election: Police commission establish team to monitor officers conduct Ekiti elections: Commission to monitor police conduct Ekiti poll: Commission to monitor police conduct
