Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State has declared that it will be impossible for the national ruling party, All Progressive Congress to win any election in the state, especially the governorship. He said that everything in Cross River was all about the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and that it would be difficult for any other governorship contender to beat him. He boasted that he hardly needed to campaign because his many people-oriented projects, appointments and regular payment of salaries to workers had given him an edge over and above his competitors. Christian Ita, Ayade’s spokesman said there was no opposition at all in the state against the governor’s second term ambition. Also reacting to claims by Senator John Owan-Enoh, who is the APC governorship candidate in the state, Ita said Owan-Enoh was looking for cheap publicity and public sympathy by claiming Ayade was destroying his billboards.
