Responding to journalists questions after the judgement, counsel to the defendant, Barrister Bashir Yusuf Muhammad, said the verdict did not surprise him considering the facts he presented before the court. Meanwhile, the PDP flag bearer, Engr. Abba Kabir Yusuf, has called on all supporters of the party to come together for the victory of PDP in all positions come 2019 polls.
