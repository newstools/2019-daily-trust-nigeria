Kwara State Internal Revenue Service (KW-IRS), yesterday, said the state has the potential of raking in about N5 billion monthly from internally generated revenue (IGR). The service added that currently the state is generating about N2 billion as its IGR, saying that based on the peculiarity of the state, it is handling the issue of tax with tact and persuasion. The Executive Chairman of KW-IRS, Prof Muritala Awodun, stated this to reporters in Ilorin, the state capital, noting that the state is next to Lagos in IGR. Prof Awodun said “that is just an evidence of the impact of the reformed revenue collection in the state,” adding that before he came on board in September 2015, the processes of revenue collection were awash with leakages. “The story over the last three and half years particularly at the close of 2018, the IGR of the state increased to N23 billion as opposed to N7.2 billion in 2015. “In 2015, the monthly IGR of the state was a paltry sum of N600 million making 27th position out of 36 states. The state’s Federal Account Allocation (FAAC) position was 34 out of 36 states and the situation of infrastructure was awful. No less than 45 infrastructural projects were abandoned. Also IGR per capita of the state was 30th out of the 36 states.
