The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has removed the names of 2,500 registered voters that died. The Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in the state, Alhaji Ahmad Makama, stated this yesterday during an interactive session with religious leaders in Damaturu. He said prior to the removal of the deceased names, the commission had displayed the list of  registered voters in the 1,718 polling units across the state, a development that gave the people opportunity to identify names of the deceased. “It is the duty of INEC to remove names of the deceased after those who made the observations filled and signed some forms,” he said. He, however, complained that over 100,000 voters’ cards were still in various offices of the commission and called on the religious leaders on the need to talk to those concerned to collect them.
