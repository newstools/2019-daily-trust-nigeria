Gabon security forces killed two suspects in a failed coup attempt in Gabon on Monday. Government security forces also captured seven others, government spokesman Guy-Bertrand Mapangou told reporters. The plotters seized control of the national radio station early on Monday morning. They then broadcast a message saying that President Ali Bongo was no longer fit for office. After the coup announcement, over 300 people initially trooped to the streets to celebrate the coup, which was later crushed by government forces.
