The Kaduna State chapter of the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) has been thrown into crisis following the choice of its governorship candidate, Ahmad Tijjani Umar. Umar was announced as the party’s candidate after the national chairman of the party, Alhaji Falalu Bello, who was affirmed as the party’s governorship flag bearer stepped down in December. The manner Umar was chosen as replacement to Bello did not go down well with members of the state working committee led by the state chairman of the party, Tom Maiyashi, who immediately put in his resignation in protest on how the governorship candidate of the party emerged, it was reported. Our correspondents learnt that officials of the party led by Maiyashi had insisted that the Kaduna State PRP governorship ticket be retained by Bello to buoy the image of the party as it goes into the 2019 elections. They were said to have felt that giving the ticket to another person then would not add much value to the party seeing the interest that the announcement of Bello as the candidate generated. But our correspondents learnt that as it became clear that Bello was insisting on stepping down as the party’s candidate, and as many from both within and outside the party began to show interest, the pressure became much on the stalwarts of the party. The State Publicity Secretary of PRP, Murtala Abubakar, who left the party in solidarity with Maiyashi said many of them were not pleased with how the current candidate of the party emerged. Efforts to get the PRP governorship candidate to comment on the matter failed as he did not respond to several calls made to his line and an SMS. Dr. Maiyashi too did not pick calls from our correspondents and did not reply a text message sent to his line. But the chairman of the Board of Trustees of PRP, Alhaji Balarabe Musa, when contacted, confirmed the resignation of Tom Maiyashi. He, however, said Maiyashi withdrew from the party in order to have time for his other businesses.
