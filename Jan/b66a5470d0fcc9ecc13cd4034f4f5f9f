Arewa Christians and Indigenous Pastors Association (ACIPA) has asked Nigerians to look beyond President Muhammadu Buhari as he is not a viable president for Nigerians in 2019. In its New Year message signed by the Coordinator, Rev. Luka Shehu, the group described years of Buhari-led administration and especially 2018 as the worst in the history of Nigeria. The statement read: “While looking forward to a more fulfilling, prosperous and secured Nigeria in 2019 and beyond, it is pertinent to note the abysmal failure of the Buhari administration in the areas he promised Nigerians since 2015. “The gulf between Christians and other denominations have widened with often little lip service or rhetoric,  the spate of Fulani militia across Nigeria, ethnic cleansing of Christians and mainly indigenous people, the abduction of school girls at Dapchi in Yobe State, the none-negotiation for the release of Leah Sharibu, the Decmber, 2018 spate of serial attacks by well organized terrorists at Metele, Baga and other towns where soldiers were decimated and had to escape while weapons of assorted types and make where carted away by terrorists who took over towns, not to mention the horrific menace of recent killings in Kaduna, Plateau, Yobe and Zamfara states where traditional rulers where abducted and killed in cold blood, were all evidence that the Buhari administration has failed Nigerians.” The association said that in decent societies, both the President and the service chiefs would have resigned since they have proved incapable of defending Nigerians, which is their primary duty.
