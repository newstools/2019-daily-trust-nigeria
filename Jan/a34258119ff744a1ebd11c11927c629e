A group, the Pipeline Right of Way Surveillance Providers Forum, has appealed to the Management of Nigerian National Petroleum Cooperation (NNPC) to immediately intervene and settle the salaries and entitlements of all community guards along Koton Karfe-Kaduna axis. The community guards were employed to protect pipelines from vandals along the axis. The group in a statement issued in Kaduna and signed by the Chairman of the group, Alhaji Ibrahim Salihu said the community guards were being owed 21 months salary “The community guards are being owed salary arrears for 21 months by MRS OIL & GAS which has resulted to untold hardship on the workers. “Series of complaint letters have been written to the management of the NNPC since last year with a view to look into their problems and solve the issue, yet nothing has been done in such regards.” He assured that the group will not relent in its efforts to seek their right through meaningful and rightful means and appealed to NNPC to come to their aid and put smile on the faces of workers. He wondered why some of their colleagues from Warri axis have been settled.
