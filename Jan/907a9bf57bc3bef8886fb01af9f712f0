A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos, Adedayo Thomas, has inaugurated a campaign office he donated for the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari in the February 16 Presidential election. Thomas, who is the Executive Director of National Film and Video Censors’ Board (NFVCB), also trained 1000 grassroots foot soldiers who would drive the campaign for the President. At the unveiling of the office named, “PMB House” located along Oshodi Road in the heart of Oshodi in Oshodi-Isolo Local Government, the APC chieftain said the office would serve as a centre and engine room for Buhari’s campaign. According to him, the President deserves re-election having championed the infrastructural revolution of the country. He said there is no state in Nigeria that is not experiencing infrastructural development courtesy of the President. “This office would also sensitize voters to understand why they must cast their votes for the President”, he said, adding, “This is the first time the country would be ruled democratically. This is the first time the country has moved drastically into the development train”. Thomas said the 1000 foot soldiers had been trained to bring on board many more Buhari supporters, adding that Buhari had already won re-election even before the poll was conducted. He noted that the Buhari’s effect had taken spread to the creative industry which he heads with billions of investments being made on a daily basis. “Let me tell you the biggest cinema in the entire Africa is coming into this country to sign a Memorandum of Understanding and work starts immediately,” he added.
