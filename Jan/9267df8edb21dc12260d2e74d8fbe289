What we are trying to do at this stage is to empower these women groups both in the villages and the cities so that they can get some financing that they presently lack to develop their businesses,” he said. ‘JAIZ Bank not troubled, wants more players in Islamic banking’ Islamic banking key to financial inclusion – CBN governor Jaiz bank witnessing a steady growth-MD
