About 500 stakeholders drawn from various security organisations from Ondo, Osun, Ekiti and Edo states are to attend a security summit this week in Ondo State as part of the state government’s efforts at finding lasting solutions to the cases of kidnapping and highway robbery that have made farmers abandon their farms. The summit will hold at the International Centre for Culture, the DOME, Akure. The chairman, planning committee of the summit, Mr Jones Ogunmusere, told journalists at a press conference yesterday at the Governor’s Office, Alagbaka, Akure, that the state’s geographical location was enabling people with criminal tendencies access it from neighbouring states, hence Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu’s decision to organize the summit. Ogunmusere said the ideas and recommendations that emerge from the summit would be harvested, processed and packaged  into a draft security policy document to be submitted to Gov Akeredolu for the state security council to consider. He added that the state House of Assembly would be involved in the summit.
