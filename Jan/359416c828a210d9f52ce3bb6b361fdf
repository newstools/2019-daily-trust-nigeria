The Secretary for Health and Human Services Secretariat, Adamu Abubakar Bappa, has said the secretariat will soon construct more solar powered boreholes in some primary healthcare centres across the six area councils of the FCT. Bappa, who stated this while commissioning PV Water International Pilot Project at the Primary Healthcare Centre in Dutsen Alhaji, Bwari on Sunday, said the secretariat was making arrangements to construct two similar ones in Kuje and AMAC. He noted that the project, which was conceived about a year ago, was the first of its kind in Nigeria, and would provide clean and safe drinking water as well as solar power in the PHC at the immediate communities. He said the project was aimed at enhancing the functionality of the primary healthcare centre facilities which required steady and reliable power for effective and efficient service delivery. The secretary said the project was funded 100 percent by PV Water International through a public private partnership with the FCT Administration.
