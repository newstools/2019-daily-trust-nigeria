Rafael Nadal overcame American youngster Frances Tiafoe in straight sets 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 to book his place in the last four of the Australian Open. The second seed arrived in Melbourne having not played a match since September because of a series of injury problems but has barely put a foot wrong all fortnight and is the only man not to have dropped a set. That statistic was not challenged by Tiafoe, who was swatted aside 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 in only an hour and 47 minutes. Nadal, who extended his winning streak over Americans to 21 straight matches, said: “For me it’s very emotional to be back in the semi-finals in Melbourne. I had some troubles here in all my career, so to be back means everything to me. Of course I’m very happy with the way that I played tonight.” The 32-year-old has now dismissed two of the next generation in Tiafoe and Alex de Minaur, and must prepare for another one in Stefanos Tsitsipas. “I said a couple of rounds ago that they can wait a little bit, but it looks like they don’t want to wait,” said Nadal with a smile. He added of Tsitsipas: “He’s a player that during the last year he has been improving every month. He’s able to win against the best players of the world already. He’s a great player. “He’s unbelievable today but he will have the chance to be one of the best for such a long time.” This has been a breakthrough slam for Tiafoe, who turned 21 on Sunday, but he was simply unable to match the relentless power and consistency of Nadal.
