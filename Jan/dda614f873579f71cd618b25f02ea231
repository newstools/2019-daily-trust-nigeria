Chinese President Xi Jinping has said that no one can change the fact that Taiwan is “part of China”, adding that Beijing will not give up the use of military force as an option to ensure “reunification”. Xi made the comments on Wednesday in a speech marking the 40th anniversary of a policy statement that eventually led to a thaw in relations with the self-ruled island. “We are firmly against those who conspire behind the ideo of ‘Two China’, or ‘One China-One Taiwan’, or Taiwan Independence,” Xi said in a part of his first major speech addressing the people of what Beijing considers a breakaway province. His speech came a day after Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen called on China to seek a peaceful solution over their differences, insisting people on the island want to maintain self-rule. “I would like to call on China to face squarely the reality of the existence of the Republic of China on Taiwan,” Tsai said in a New Year’s Day address, referring to the island’s formal name.
