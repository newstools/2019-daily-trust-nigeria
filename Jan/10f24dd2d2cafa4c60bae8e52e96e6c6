A resident of the area, Ramatu Danjuma, said the baby was found covered in a wrapper in the bush by some youth while going to the farm on Tuesday morning. She said the cry of the baby attracted the attention of the youth, who went in search of it, discovered it and came back to the village to alert the people. “I suspect that the woman dumped the baby in the night. Some boys who were going to the farm in the morning heard the cry of the baby and when they found it dumped by the roadside in the bush, they went back to the village and raised alarm,” she said.
