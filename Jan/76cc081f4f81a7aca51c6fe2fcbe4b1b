Reporters Without Borders (RSF) says it is appalled by Nigerian army’s raids on Daily Trust newspaper and arrests of two of its journalists in response to a report that the army had lost of control of several Northeastern towns. Condemning the raid as serious press freedom violation, RSF urges the Nigerian authorities not to obstruct journalists, regardless of the stories they cover. Yesterday’s issue of the Daily Trust, one of northern Nigeria’s most popular newspapers, nearly did not appear as a result of the raids on 6 January on its headquarters in the capital, Abuja, where computers were seized, and on its bureau in the northeastern city of Maiduguri, where bureau chief Uthman Abubakar and one of his reporters, Ibrahim Sawab, were arrested. Daily Trust editor Mannir Dan-Ali told RSF that the raids were prompted by an article in the 6 January issue reporting that a faction of the Jihadi terror group Boko Haram had occupied several towns in Borno State and that the army was massing troops to retake the towns. The army, which had never recognized the loss of these towns, defended the raids on the Daily Trust on the grounds that the newspaper had “divulged classified military information, thus undermining national security.” “It is unacceptable that the military should take justice into their own hands, carrying out arbitrary arrests, seizing equipment and intimidating journalists just because an article was not to their liking,” said Arnaud Froger, the head of RSF’s Africa desk. This is not the first time that the military have targeted Daily Trust, regarded as one of the leading sources of coverage of Boko Haram activities in northern Nigeria. Soldiers stormed the newspaper’s office in 2013 in an attempt to arrest a reporter who wrote a story critical of the military.
