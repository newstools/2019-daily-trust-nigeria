A former deputy national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Olabode George, has ended insinuations of a rift between him and the party’s candidate in Lagos State, Mr. Jimi Agbaje, as he has officially raised his hand and that of his running mate, Haleemat Busari, endorsing them for the March governorship election in the state. This was the outcome of a stakeholders’ meeting which ended on Wednesday evening held at Chief George residence. At the end of what was called a family meeting, George also dismissed insinuations that the PDP in Lagos was divided, saying that was the figment of imagination of the ruling party. Besides, he condemned the violence which rocked the inaugural campaign rally of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos, describing it as madness taken too far. There had been insinuations over the state of the party in Lagos with observers suggesting that all was not well between the party leadership and its candidates as the 2019 elections approach. Addressing the press, the PDP leader said the party “has now come out stronger on a mission of rescue and salvage,” adding that “Lagos must be redeemed and unchained from the manacles of APC.” No rift between me and Agbaje – Bode George Lagos 2019: No rift between party leaders, Agbaje – PDP chair Lagos 2019: I'm confident of defeating Ambode,Sanwo-Olu,Otedola — Jimi Agbaje
