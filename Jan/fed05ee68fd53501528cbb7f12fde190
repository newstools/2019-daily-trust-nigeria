President Muhammadu Buhari and former President Olusegun Obasanjo met at the Council of State meeting, barely two days after a hot exchange between the two leaders. Obasanjo had on Sunday likened the Buhari administration to the military era of late General Sani Abacha, adding that the president was plotting to rig the forthcoming election. The Presidency responded by describing the former president as grandfather of corruption who was jittery that he would be called to account. Before that commencement of the meeting, President Buhari went round the council chamber and exchanged pleasantries with some of the past leaders, including Obasanjo. The two leaders did not show any sign of problem between them. Daily Trust reports that Obasanjo offered the opening Christian prayer, while former Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) Mohammed Uwais said the Muslim prayer. A one minute silence was observed in honour of former President Shehu Shagari, and late CJNs Aloysius Katsina Alu and Idris Kutigi who were members of the council before their death. The Council of State meeting which lasted for about three hours was also attended by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Senate President, Bukola Saraki, former President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, former Head of State, Abdulsalami Abubakar and the former Head of the Interim Government, Chief Ernest Shonekan. Others include former CJNs Alfa Belgore and Mahmud Mohammed. Also present were governors of Osun, Kebbi, Zamfara, Plateau, Ebonyi, Adamawa, Edo, Lagos, Niger, Borno, Ogun, Ekiti, Kogi and deputy governors of Bauchi, Kaduna, and Rivers State. Two former Heads of State, Yakubu Gowon and Ibrahim Babangida sent apologies for their absence at the meeting. House of Representatives Speaker Yakubu Dogara was also absent.
