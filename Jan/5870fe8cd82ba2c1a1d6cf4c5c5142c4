President Muhammadu Buhari has appointed Umar Ibrahim El-Yakub as his Senior Special Assistant on National Assembly (House of Representatives). The appointment, according to a statement by the President’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, followed the resignation of Kawu Sumaila as the Senior Special Assistant (SSA) to the President on National Assembly Matters (House of Representatives). Kawu, who was appointed as SSA in August 2015, resigned to contest for the Sumaila/Takai Federal Constituency seat in Kano state under the ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC). His successor, El-Yakub, an APC stalwart from Kano state, was a member of the House of Representatives in 1998 and 2003-2007 representing Kano Municipal Federal Constituency.
