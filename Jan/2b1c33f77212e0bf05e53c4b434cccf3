The Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) has pledged to intensify its efforts at repositioning the nation’s maritime industry to meet the Federal Government’s 2019 budget proposal. A statement by the agency’s Head of Corporate Communication, Isichei Osangbi, said that the Director-General of NIMASA, Dr. Dakuku Peterside, stated this during the Independent Newspapers Awards 2018, where the agency bagged the Federal Agency of the Year Award. Dakuku said, “We are spurred by this award and we appreciate the fact that our efforts to revitalise the maritime sector through our medium term strategic plan are yielding results. “We will redouble our efforts to ensure that the quest of the Federal Government to diversify the economy gets the required support from the maritime sector and its stakeholders, as it portends several opportunities for economic growth and development,” he said.
