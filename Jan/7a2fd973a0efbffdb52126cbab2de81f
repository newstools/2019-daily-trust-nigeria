The National Power Training Institute of Nigeria (NAPTIN) says it earned over 600,000 euro (about N250 million) from training 545 Nigerian and Ghanaian electricity workers under its collaboration with the Association of Power Utilities of Africa (APUA) in 2018. NAPTIN acting Director General Ahmed Nagode, who was speaking in Lagos during the official launch of NAPTIN/West African Power Poll (WAPP) training programme for 80 Liberia Electricity Corporation staff, said the initiative will not only lead to enhancement of the capacity and competence of the manpower of the utilities, but also transform into improvement in the delivery of electricity to the countries. It also serves as a means of generating foreign exchange to the nation because the contract with APUA is in euro which is paid to our TSA account, he added. According to him, the training programme is being implemented in batches in order not to unsettle the smooth and scheduled operations of the utilities. He noted that NAPTIN has keyed into President Muhammadu Buhari administration’s initiative of job creation for Nigerian teeming youth. NAPTIN will this year be training many Nigerians who seek to develop career in the power sector, on skills acquisition programmes that are in high demand in the privatised utilities namely, Distribution Substation Operation (DSO), Cable Jointing, Lines Maintenance, and Electrical Fitting. In addition to this is the training on Solar PV Installation and Maintenance which will give those who graduate from it the opportunity to be self-employed and also play a critical role in the country’s drive towards promoting renewable energy as an alternative source of power production.
