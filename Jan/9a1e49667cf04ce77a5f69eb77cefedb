Work on the 136 kilometre road from Ilorin in Kwara State up to Kabba in Kogi State has resumed, Daily Trust on Sunday gathered. Speaking with journalists, the Kwara State Federal Controller of Works, Engineer Atitebi Waisu, said the cost of the project stands at N21. 734 billion and that the contract is being handled by Messrs CGC Nigeria Limited. Engineer Waisu said Section I of the road begins from Ilorin through Ajase-Ipo, Omu-Aran and Egbe and terminates at Egiba in Kogi State, while the Section II begins from Ejiba and ends in Kabba in Kogi State. The Controller said the original contract was awarded on February 8, 2017, with an agreement of 36 months completion period. Asked of what caused the delay in the execution of the project, he said price variation was part of the problem between the government and the contractor “but the issue has since been resolved and from our site inspection I can tell you on authority that work is going on smoothly.” The Controller denied rumour that the road project was being executed by the Kwara State Government to be reimbursed later by the Federal Government.
