Reports from Zimbabwe said no fewer than 12 people have been killed in a crackdown on protests that began in the Southern African country on Monday over a sudden increase in fuel prices. Washinton Post reports that at least 78 have been shot and more than 240 have faced “assault, torture, inhumane and degrading treatment” in the onslaught by the security agencies. The Zimbabwe Human Rights Forum in a statement also says 466 people have been arbitrarily detained in what it calls “massive” violations. The statement says children as young as 9 have been reportedly tortured as security forces break into private homes. A prominent pastor and political activist, Evan Mawarire was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly inciting the protest via the social media.
