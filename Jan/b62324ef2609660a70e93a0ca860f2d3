The Kaduna State governorship candidate under the platform of Mega Party of Nigeria (MPN), Muhammed Kabir Usman, has promised to complete  Zaria water project if elected as the next governor of the state. He made the promise in a statement signed by his Director Media and Publicity, Dr. Al’amen Muhammad. He lamented that the present ruling All Progressives Congress APC  in the state promised to complete the 150-million litre project before the end of  2018 ,but failed to do so. “The state Government said they have spent almost N56 billion for the completion of the project, but till now the people of Zaria and other local governments are yet to benefit or enjoy the water,” he said. The governorship candidate also called on the state government to come out and explain to the people of the state on why the water project was yet to be completed.
