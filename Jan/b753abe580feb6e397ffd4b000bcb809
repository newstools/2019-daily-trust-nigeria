The Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) has served mass summons to judges over some alleged discrepancies in their asset declaration forms. Some judges on Thursday rushed with copies of their asset declaration forms as issued by the Code of  Conduct Bureau (CCB) to answer the summons. A source confided in Daily Trust that judges who could not reconcile details contained in their asset forms for the last four years, could be charged to court. “We do not know why the CCT is issuing the summons to judges now, but it may be related to the CJN matter,” the source.
