The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Katsina has asked the state governor, Aminu Masari, to resign for admitting that the state is under siege by bandits and kidnappers. Speaking with newsmen on Thursday, the state party chairman, Salisu Majigiri, said Masari has openly admitted his failure and the most appropriate thing for him to do is to step aside and allow those who can to take charge. According to him, the declaration of the governor is scary and a contradiction to an early statement of President Muhammadu Buhari who told the world that security has been achieved. “Our take is that, Masari promised on assumption of office that security will be improved, but today he openly said he can’t. “If the governor is not safe himself ,who else is? This statement should be carefully looked at; this is an open truth and we also fear for our lives. “How can people be in Government House that cannot be secured? What about our lives as citizens then,” he said. He added that the PDP as a party will embarked  on a peaceful protest march to press home for their safety adding that “we now fear for our lives in Katsina.”
