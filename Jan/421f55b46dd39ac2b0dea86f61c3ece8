The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has said most Nigerians are living under hunger and extreme poverty under the APC-led administration. Dogara made the comment on Monday in Kaltungo LGA of Gombe State at the flagging off campaign of the PDP gubernatorial candidate in the state, Senator Usman Bayero Nafada. He said majority of Nigerians are living in abject poverty, rising unemployment and insecurity in the last three years of President Muhammad Buhari’s administration. The speaker therefore urged the electorates to vote for the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, who he said has the solutions to the highlighted problems. Dogara added that it is the right time to vote for Atiku who is from the North-East geo-political zone, “to accelerate development of the zone devastated by the Boko Haram insurgency over the years.” On his part, Senator Bayero commended Governor Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo for the improved security and people-oriented projects he executed in the state. He pledged to continue with all ongoing projects started by Dankwambo’s administration if elected as the governor in the forthcoming election. While presenting the PDP flags to the party’s candidates, Dankwambo pledged his unflinching loyalty to Atiku Abubakar, the party’s presidential flag bearer. Governor Dankwambo called on electorates to vote for all the candidates fielded by the PDP, to end hunger, poverty and unemployment. He added that he will do all it takes to ensure that Atiku and all the party’s candidates emerge victorious in the 2019 general elections.
