German Chancellor Angela Merkelhas said Germany will take on greater responsibility internationally in 2019, and keep pushing for global solutions to the challenges of climate change, migration and “terrorism”. In her annual New Year’s address, the four-term chancellor said international cooperation was needed to master these problems, but said old certainties about the multilateral approach was “coming under pressure”. “In such a situation, we must again stand up for, argue and fight more strongly for our convictions,” Merkel said in a text of the message her office released before a scheduled Monday broadcast. “And we must take on more responsibility in our own interests.” Germany will campaign for “global solutions” through the United Nations, Merkel said, noting the country is spending more on humanitarian aid and defence.
