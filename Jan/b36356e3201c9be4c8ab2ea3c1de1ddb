Some families on Wednesday stormed Lagos State to hold a rally for the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari. The families, under the umbrella of Nigerian Families for Baba Buhari, hinged their decision to back the president for another term on what they termed the progress that have been made in the short span of four years, albeit in the midst of distractions. Speaking during the rally at the Freedom Park, coordinator of the families, Festus Akintola, said the Buhari-led government had shown tenacity in its drive to set Nigeria on the part of economic growth and sustainability According to Akintola, “Considering the prosperity and prospect we enjoy from taking the right decision of supporting President Muhammadu Buhari to emerge winner in 2015, we should have stayed back in our respective places of employment, businesses and homes. But the good governance that is being delivered to us is something that must not be interrupted. There is need for the good life we now have, courtesy President Buhari’s government, to continue. “Therefore, we are gathered here because of our firm belief in the imperative of ensuring the continuity of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Buhari-Osinbajo Presidency for another four years term in office. “Lagosians are known to be politically enlightened. We have been able to read between the lines and we have watched with keen interests the events of the past four years. We have been able to compare with what existed before and we know that the best bet for us is for Baba Buhari to continue in office for another four years.
