Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) has called on electricity consumers to disregard rumour making the rounds that it was deliberately depriving them of adequate power supply for some political reasons. A statement signed by the company’s spokesman, Mohammed Kandi, indicated that the power shortage being experienced in some parts of Kano, Katsina and Jigawa states was due to some transmission constraints. “The power supply shortage is caused by failure of our second 150MVA transformer at Kumbotso substation in Kano. The transformer is undergoing repairs. The problem has no link whatsoever with the alleged attempt to sabotage the President Muhammadu Buhari APC-led government.” “In addition to the faulty two out of four 150MVA transformers at Kumbotso transmission substation is a dip in power generation occasioned by two major system collapses that were recorded earlier in January, 2019,” the statement said. It also quoted KEDCO’s Head of System Operation and Dispatch, Engr. Shuaibu Adeiza, as saying “Normally, when the grid recovers from disturbance like system collapse, places far north of the country like Kano and other states in the region become subservient to operation.
