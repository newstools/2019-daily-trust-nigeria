The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Katsina said the recent declaration of the National Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, of canvassing hundred percent of total votes in 2019 general elections for President Muhammadu Buhari and incumbent Katsina governor, Aminu Masari, is a clear indication of planned rigging ahead of the polls. The chairman of the party, Salisu Magijiri, told Daily Trust that the fears and suspicion of the party is being confirmed by the latest comments of Oshiomhole. According to him, all the factors that were used to destroy its then presidential candidate in 2014, Goodluck Jonathan, are no more saying that “I wonder how they want to get hundred percent of votes.” “In 2015, they (APC) used region and ethnicity against our then candidate and still, the PDP garnered over 10,000 votes in Katsina and now that all those factors are no more, you can’t beat us or target that,” he said He said, with the inherent difficult conditions that the APC administration have plunged the nation, the people are wiser and resolute to change the change that have failed us in the last three and half years. “Your inadequacies have made it easy for the PDP to emerged victorious with free and fair level-playing ground,” he said In a related development, the Katsina PDP has launched a new programme titled “PDP Sawuta” aimed at mobilising grassroot support towards the 2019 general elections. The party chairman at the launch, expressed optimism that the programme if well implemented would enable the party stands tall to emerge victorious at the polls. In his remarks, the Chairman of the programme, Gambo Mai-Walda, said the target of the programme is to mobilise 25,000 of its supporters to lobby 500,000 people during the polls.
