The Association of Bureaux De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON) has called on the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to implement provisions of its circular in 2014 by making BDCs direct agents of international money transfer operators (IMTOs) as obtained in other countries. The association also called for the restoration of its status as a self-regulatory organisation (SRO) in order to ensure effective coordination of the over 4,500 BDCs across the country. The association made this call in its Economic Review for the fourth quarter of 2018 (Q1’18), saying: “Inasmuch as the regulatory bodies in Nigeria have realised the indispensable role that the BDC sub-sector occupies in the stabilisation of the currency in Nigeria, the sector should be further strengthened and developed to achieve greater systemic efficiency. “The CBN should implement its circular of 2014 for making BDCs direct agents of international money transfer operators as obtained in other climes. “CBN should revisit the suspension of ABCON as a self-regulatory organisation for result oriented coordination of the over 4,500 CBN licensed BDCs.’’ ‘CBN, ABCON partnership stabilises naira despite campaign spendings’ 21,000 Nigerians dependent on BDC subsector for jobs – ABCON President BDC, foreign reserves and Emifiele’s regulations
