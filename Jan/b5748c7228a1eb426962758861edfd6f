Senator Dino Melaye is being detained by police investigators at the Special Anti Armed Robbery Squad (SARS) offices in Guzape, Abuja over his alleged involvement in an attempted murder of a police man, Daily Trust has gathered. Daily Trust learnt that Melaye submitted himself to the police after several days of resisting arrest, hiding at his Maitama residence during a standoff with police operatives determined to arrest him. Melaye submitted himself at the headquarters of the Nigerian Police Force, accompanied by other lawmakers and his lawyer Mike Ezekome, where they demanded a meeting with the Inspection General of Police. It was learnt the IGP could not meet Melaye because he was in a meeting, before he was later whisked away by police men to the SARS office where he is being kept in preparation to move him to Lokoja, Kogi State. The police is said to be investigating the shooting of a police Sergent on stop and search duty involving someone in the convoy of senator Melaye. The policeman, who is said to be recieving treatment from a gun shot wound at the Federal Medical Centre, Lokoja, was injured in Kogi State last year July. Daily Trust was unable to get a comment from the spokesman of the Nigeria police, DCP Jimoh Moshood. He did not respond to phone calls and messages sent to him at the time of filing this report.
