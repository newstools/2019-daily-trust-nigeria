The Director General of Voice of Nigeria (VON), Osita Okechukwu, has advised the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to stop shopping for excuses and concentrate more on campaign after the outrage over the appointment of Amina Zakari as chairperson of Election Collation Center, Okechukwu, who is a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), said yesterday that “One is constrained to advice the PDP to leave propaganda, stop shopping for excuses and concentrate more on real campaign. For the truth of the matter is that the electoral machine under the state of the art Card Reader, one of the greatest antidote to rigging invention, is impeccable. There is no way Hajia Amina Zakari can manipulate the Card Reader process. How can she alter or stop the results from Enugu, Ekiti, Bayelsa or even Jigawa or any other State for that matter?” “I laughed when I saw my friend Kola, spokesman of the PDP banging the table that Amina will manipulate the results. How? Is she going to be the Returning Officer? Is PDP Agent going to sleep? Is there fear that he will be compromised by Amina? My understanding is that Amina’s role is more administrative than electoral result management, pure and simple.” PDP accuses APC of conniving with INEC to rig Let Amina Zakari be Ekiti guber: Fayemi hired four top INEC staff to manipulate July poll, Fayose alleges
