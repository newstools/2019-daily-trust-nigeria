The Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, has lifted the ban on civil operation at the Nigerian Air Force (NAF)’s Airport in Makurdi, the Benue State capital. Daily Trust reports that the NAF airfield in Makurdi was temporarily closed in November last year to allow repairs and maintenance of the runway which had become uncomfortable for taxiing aircrafts. Abubakar, on Thursday, directed the Air Officer Commanding (AOC) of the Tactical Air Command (TAC) of the NAF Base in Makurdi, AVM Oladayo Amao, during his operational visit to Benue, to immediately send NOTAM (Notice To Airmen) to the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) so that civil aircrafts can begin landing in Makurdi. The Airforce boss, who inspected the runways at the Flight Line of the 131 Engineering Group of the NAF base, also directed the immediate duplication of prototype wireless alarm (base siren) imputed with frequency moderator which transmits signals to cover 4.2 meters in Maiduguri, Yola and Port Harcourt airfields. “It is now very clear that the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) is a professional force that has nothing to do with who is landing here and who is not landing here. We cannot allow aircrafts to land here if we believe that, in the process of landing, safety issues are involved. Those who wish to come and land here can now do so. “Now, civil traffic into Makurdi can now be restored. So, let us go ahead and send the necessary papers to NCAA that the Makurdi Airport is now open to civil operation,” he said.
