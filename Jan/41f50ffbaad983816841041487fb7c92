The Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore Fulani Socio-Cultural Association has urged Nigerians to reject Alhaji Atiku Abubakar as the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at Feb.16 polls. The National President of the Association, Alhaji Bello Bodejo, made the call yesterday at a news conference in Abuja. He accused Atiku of trying to destabilise the country using the latest Amnesty International (AI)’s report on the farmer/herders’ conflicts in some parts of the North. In the AI’s report released in December and entitled, ‘Harvest of Deaths: Three Years of Bloody Clashes Between Farmers and Herders,’ the international organisation said the clashes claimed 3,641 lives in the past three years. The organisation said the killings were fuelled by the “failure of authorities to investigate communal clashes and bring perpetrators to justice,” an allegation that the Federal Government has dismissed as false. “Atiku weighed in on the report to attack the President Muhammadu Buhari administration for failing in its duty to protect the lives of its people who have witnessed many preventable deaths,” the chairman said. Miyetti Allah came down hard on the former vice president, describing his reaction as “a naked dance in the market place.” “We totally condemn the desperate vituperation of Atiku for lashing on the false Amnesty International report with the hope of garnering political capital from the farmers/herders conflict. “We call on our members and peace-loving Nigerians not only to condemn him for the naked dance in the market place but to totally reject him as a presidential candidate,” he said.
