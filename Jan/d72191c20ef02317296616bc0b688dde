Four of five Gabon military officers who attempted a coup to take over power in the oil rich West African country have been arrested. Reuters reports that the four officers were arrested at the radio station shortly after they had announced their plan to take over power. Reports said one of the officers is on the run as the government declared the attempt as a failed mission. Soldiers in Gabon have attempted coup announcing the establishment of a “restoration council” after taking over the national radio station. But the communications minister later on Monday announced that most of the renegade military officers had been arrested and the situation was under control. There were still reports of shots being fired in the capital, Libreville.
