The presidential candidate of the Peoples Trust (PT) for the February 16, 2019, election, Mr. Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, has urged the Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar-led National Peace Committee (NPC) and the Nigeria Judicial Council (NJC) to intervene and amicably resolve the suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Walter Onnoghen, in order to avert political and constitutional crises. Olawepo-Hashim said President Muhammadu Buhari acted on a “black market” ex-parte order procured at the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) to suspend Onnoghen and swear in Justice Tanko Mohammed as acting CJN. He said all the presidential candidates, including President Buhari of the APC, were made to sign a peace accord, which among others, was to ensure peace before and after the elections. “The suspension of the CJN barely three weeks to the elections and the hasty manner in which the acting CJN, Justice Tanko, swore in judges of election tribunals, have compromised the credibility of the electoral process and are thus capable of undermining peace and stability during and after the elections,” he said.
