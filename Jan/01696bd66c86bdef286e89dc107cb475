Democratic Republic of Congoâ€™s opposition said on Monday it expected one of its candidates to win the presidential election based on early vote tallies, but the ruling coalition said it was confident its candidate had won the chaotic contest. The competing claims followed a disorderly election day on Sunday in which many Congolese were unable to vote due to an Ebola outbreak, conflict and logistical problems. After unofficial tallies started to circulate on social media on Monday, most mobile internet connections in the capital Kinshasa went down, residents said, in a possible move by authorities to stop the information from circulating. Connections were also slow or down in the eastern city of Goma. Government officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Authorities have cut the internet in the past, saying they sought to stop rumours from spreading during protests.
