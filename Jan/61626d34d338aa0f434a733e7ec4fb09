Plateau State Governor Simon Bako Lalong has granted pardon to four  prisoners serving various jail terms in the state, in commemoration of the New Year. The governor, in his New Year goodwill message to the people of the state, stated that the sentences of three of the convicts were commuted to absolute pardon; while the third convict had his life sentence commuted to 21 years. A statement issued by the governor’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mark Longyen, stated that Lalong had approved the granting  of pardon in exercise of the powers conferred on him under Section 212 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) and after consulting with the State Advisory Council on Prerogative of Mercy. The statement identified those pardoned as Abdullahi Musa, Rev. Samson Bisat and Chikwu Anadi who were granted absolute pardon; while Emmanuel Ochiba who was sentenced to life imprisonment has now been commuted to 21 years jail term. Governor Lalong urged  the people of the state and the nation at large to commit the year 2019 to sobriety, penance, forgiveness and fervent prayers for divine intervention, stressing that “no challenge under heaven is immune to the power of prayers.”
