Elder statesman and former Publicity Secretary of the defunct National Party of Nigeria, NPN, Chief Simon Shango has slammed ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo, for his recent attack on the government of President Muhammadu Buhari. Chief Shango was reacting to Sunday’s press conference where Obasanjo attacked the Buhari Government and labelled it another Sani Abacha era. He called on the ex-leader to desist from ‘the habit of spreading falsehoods and half-truths on the pages of newspapers to the detriment of peace and tranquillity’. He asked rhetorically , “Who is an Elder statesman? Should an Elder statesman conduct himself in public with dignity? Should an Elder statesman continue to throw spanners in the wheels of progress to advance his selfish cause? “The above question is for discerning Nigerians to answer as regards the recent outburst by no other than the self-serving and all righteous Olusegun Obasanjo titled “Points for Concern and Action.” ‘Why Obasanjo is attacking Jonathan’ Obasanjo not speaking for Nigerians – APC chieftain Arewa Consultative Forum dissociates self from attack on Obasanjo
