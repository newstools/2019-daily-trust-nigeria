The APC gubernatorial candidate in Cross River State, Senator John Owan-Enoh, has approached the minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Pastor Usani Usani, for peace and reconciliation following the High Court rejection of the latter’s request for him to be declared as the authentic candidate of the party. In a public statement issued in Calabar, Senator Owan-Enoh urged Pastor Usani and his supporters to sheathe the sword and embrace peace in the overall interest of APC and Cross River State “so that together we can rescue our state from mediocrity and bad governance.” He said he strongly believed that responsible politics all over the world was premised on compromise or give-and-take, without which development would be seen in the dividing line between savagery and barbarism. “Politics of civility and enlightenment for which our state is renowned over the years should be uppermost in our minds. Losers should accept their defeat with equanimity and winners share their victory with magnanimity,” he said. Reacting, Usani insisted that he remained the governorship candidate because no court had invalidated their earlier judgement. Speaking through the director general of Usani Campaign Organization, Ene Cobham, the minister said it was only the Appeal Court that could set aside the judgement of December 13, 2018. Usani insisted that he remained the authentic governorship candidate of the APC in Cross River State, saying the party flag given to Owan-Enoh was a big error by the national leadership of the party.
