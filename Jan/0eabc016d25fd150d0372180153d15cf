President Muhammadu Buhari has slashed the budget of the National Assembly by N14.5 billion, Daily Trust reports. The federal legislature got N139.5bn in the 2018 budget, but under this year’s budget, the president proposed the sum of N125bn for the lawmakers, representing a reduction of N14.5bn. A careful look at the proposed National Assembly’s budget showed that the entire N125bn was under recurrent expenditure, with ‎overhead and capital having zero allocation. The proposal showed no further breakdown of the National Assembly budget. For many years, there had been no details for the National Assembly budget, until in ‎2017 when the two chambers made details of their budget public following sustained public pressure. Daily Trust recalls that the president had initially proposed the same N125bn for the lawmakers in 2018, but the legislators jerked it up to N139.5bn, a development that did not go down well with the executive arm. Our correspondent reports that from a budget of N19bn in the year 2000, the National Assembly’s budget ballooned to N150bn at some point. WATCH ALSO:
