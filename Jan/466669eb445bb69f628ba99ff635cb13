Chad and Israel have renewed diplomatic ties in what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described as “a partnership… to forge a prosperous and secure future for our countries”. His comments came during a brief visit to Chad where he was welcomed by President Idriss Deby. In recent years, Israel has made a big effort to improve diplomatic relations with several African countries. Chad, which has a majority Muslim population, cut ties in 1972. Mr Netanyahu’s visit reciprocates President Deby’s trip to Israel last November, the first by a Chadian leader. In addition to renewing diplomatic ties the two leaders signed several agreements, Mr Deby told a joint press conference, but did not say what those deals were.
