The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has granted owners of illegal filling stations and gas plants within Abuja and environs up to the first quarter of this year to regularise their outlets or face sanctions. The ultimatum was issued by the Zonal Operations Controller, DPR Abuja, Alhaji Misau Abba, during the 2018 Annual General Stakeholders meeting organised by the department with the theme, ‘Regulatory Compliance as a Tool for Safe Operations in Nigeria’s Oil and Gas Industry’. Abba said the move was part of measures taken to ensure that illegal retail outlets were regularised. “DPR will take all necessary measures within the ambience of the law on any illegal retail outlets that fail to regularise after the expiration of the grace period,” he warned. The forum, which brought together major players in the downstream oil and gas sector to review the 2018 operational challenges and set out new plan for the new year, was organised as part of DPR’s efforts to sensitive stakeholders on guidelines governing operations. The Director of the DPR, Mr. Modecai D.B Ladan, said the department has some new innovations to serve the public better. Represented by the Zonal Controller, Maiduguri, Mr. Idris Ali, the director said one of the new innovations was the full implementation of online processing of downstream licences, permits and approvals. “These were achieved through the Retail Outlets Monitoring System (ROMS), Depots System (DEPOT), Import and Export (IMPEX), Lube Blending Plant System (LBL), Coastal Vessel License System (CVL) and Refinery Operations System (RPL),” he said. He said the Oil and Gas Industry Service Permit (OGISP) application has also been automated, meaning that interested applicants can easily make applications from the comfort of their homes or offices worldwide.
