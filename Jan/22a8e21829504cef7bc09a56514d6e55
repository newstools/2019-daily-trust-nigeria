Former Vice President and Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar has been exonerated from statement which implied that 30 accused persons are working for President Muhammadu Buhari, saying it was a personal opinion of the author which the media erroneously ascribed to the PDP candidate. According to a statement, the Director General of the Atiku Presidential Campaign Organization and Deputy Chairman of the PDP Presidential Campaign Council (South), Otunba Gbenga Daniel explained this while talking to journalists at the Abuja airport on his way to the South East rally in Owerri on Tuesday. According to the former governor of Ogun State, Atiku Abubakar “is a statesman and not in the habit of making unguarded and unsubstantiated claims about persons and institutions. The media probably got it wrong and simply elevated personal opinions to that of Atiku Abubakar. They simply cannot be the same. “Atiku believes in the rule of law, and would not accuse people wrongly especially if no competent court of law has found them guilty. “That is what distinguishes Atiku Abubakar from the current APC government which has elevated deceit and lies to such height in Statecraft. 2019 Campaigns Heat Up How Atiku emerged as Buhari’s main challenger Authentic Yoruba leaders have endorsed Atiku as next President – Babatope
