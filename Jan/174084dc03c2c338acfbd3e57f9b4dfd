The newly appointed Secretary for Local Education Authority (LEA) in Abaji Area Council, Alhaji Umar Ndagi, has said his administration’s top priority was primary school teachers’ welfare. Ndagi, while speaking with newsmen in his office yesterday, said giving priority to teachers’ welfare would motivate the teachers to perform optimally. He also reiterated his administration’s commitment to improve on the standard of basic education in the area, even as he called on FCT administration and the area council to build additional classroom blocks to meet the pupils’ enrollment triggered by influx of people into the FCT. He said efforts were ongoing to address the menace of girl child labour, teenage pregnancy and school dropout, while urging parents to empower their wards by giving them quality education. “Most importantly, I want to call on parents to cultivate the habit of monitoring the movement of their wards especially when they were leaving for schoolor  after closing from school,” he said.
