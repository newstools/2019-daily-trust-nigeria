Two armed robbery suspects arrested by operatives of the Lagos State Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) have admitted killing a woman because she made an effort to save her husband from being robbed. The police said that the suspects, Isah Shobayo and Olalekan Ogundimu, had invaded the home of one Mr Akin on January 1, 2019 and held the man and his wife, Modupe Catherine, hostage at gunpoint. The victims’ children were said to be away to church for the cross-over service at the time of the incident. The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal, said that Catherine stood between the robbers and her husband, pleading with them not to kill him. Edgal added that unfortunately for the woman, one of the robbers shot her on the chest, after which they made away with their victims’ phones, laptops and a cash sum of N2,200. But Ogundimu, whom the police identified as the killer, denied firing the shot that killed Catherine, saying it was Shobayo who did the killing. He said, “We had arrived the house a few minutes to New Year day with the intention to rob and not to kill. However, while we were asking the man to give us money, his wife jumped in front of him pleading to us to spare her husband. She claimed that her husband had been sick. But my partner, out of fear, fired a shot at her, killing her.” Edgal, who paraded the suspects, said that SARS operatives who visited the house after the robbery gathered “items of evidential importance”, which were analysed, leading to the arrest of one of the robbers. “During interrogation, he confessed to committing the crime. He later led detectives to arrest one other suspect who served as their armourer,” he said.
