“In fact, we want put it on record that, those calling for emergency rule have no interest of the state at heart”, he declared. The IPAC chairman reminded the APC-led federal government of the far reaching negative consequences a declaration of an emergency in the state would have on the electorate. Yusuf said rather the federal government should device more strategies to end the activities of bandits. He stressed that, those calling for emergency rule were self- centred and unconcerned with the political and economic development of the people in the state. “The political parties in the state are in support of the state and federal government collaboration in fighting bandits,” he said. He urged the federal government to distance itself from the agitators of emergency rule  and focus on the provision of more security actions  to tackle the problem.
