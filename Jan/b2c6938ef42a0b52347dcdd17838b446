The Caretaker Committee of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Ogun State has slammed Governor Ibikunle Amosun over what it called the governor’s constant attacks on APC governorship candidate, Dapo Abiodun. The spokesman of the Committee, Tunde Oladunjoye, in a statement made available to our correspondent in Abeokuta, said Amosun was suffering from “outgoing syndrome, emanating political amnesia and loss of touch with reality.” The governor, who was against Abiodun’s emergence as APC flagbearer, has openly declared that he would not support him in the next election. He had vowed to ensure victory of his anointed candidate, Adekunle Akinlade who is contesting on the platform of Allied Peoples Movement (APM). But Oladunjoye said the party remained focused despite Amosun’s position, saying Abiodun’s victory “is assured.” The statement partly reads: “For an individual to attempt to play God, and assault the collective intelligence of the well informed people of Ogun State by telling them who the next governor of Ogun State will be, as if he has already written the results, shows that such person deserves our pity; we don’t need to exchange words with him, but to actually sympathize with him on his present state of paranoia on Prince Dapo Abiodun.”
