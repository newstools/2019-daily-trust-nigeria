A Karmo Grade 1 Area Court, Abuja, yesterday sentenced an 18-year-old man, Henry Sunday, to three months’ imprisonment for stealing a laptop and cell phone. The judge, Alhaji Inuwa Maiwada, said the court had no option than to sentence the convict accordingly since he had pleaded guilty to the charge. Maiwada, however, gave the convict an option of N6,000 fine. He said the convict’s plea saved the court the pains of prolonged prosecution. The judge warned the convict to be of good behaviour and desist from committing crime after serving out his punishment. Earlier, the prosecuting counsel, Mrs Ijeoma Ukagha, had told the court that on Jan. 1, one Safiyanu Abudullahi of Utako village reported the case at Utako Police Station. Ijeoma said the convict broke into the complainant’s shop and stole the laptop and cell phone worth N48,000. She said the complainant raised an alarm when he came back to his shop and discovered that his shop was burgled. She said the complainant rushed to the station and reported the incident for proper investigation, which led to the arrest of the convict. The prosecuting counsel said during police investigation the stolen items were found in the convict’s bag, and that he admitted committing the offence. The offence contravened the provisions of Section 287 of the Penal Code. Following the plea of the convict, the prosecutor prayed the court to try him summarily under Section 347 of the Administration of Criminal Justices Act, 2015. (NAN)
