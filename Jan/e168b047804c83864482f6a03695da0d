The managing director of National Inland Waterways (NIWA), Senator Adeleke Olorunnimbe Mamora, has said that Baro port will soon commence operations. Mamora said that is possible following the completion of the installation of the cargo handling equipment. The equipment, which is valued at N2.5 billion, were moved to site recently, according to the MD.  The Baro River port in Niger State, awarded in 2011/12  at a cost of N2,563,499,248 by the Federal Executive Council to Messrs  Global Projects Ltd has been completed but abandoned and left in ruins before the current management resuscitated and turned it into use. But Mamora, speaking at the weekend when he visited the Baro River Port to ascertain the level of work done so far, hinted that operations would soon commence. Mamora, who was impressed by what he saw, the contractors already fixing the last equipment, assured the MD that it will be ready in another one week or two. The MD commended the contractors for a job well done and the community for being a good host and encouraged them to ensure the safety and security of the River Port.  The MD said the equipment at Baro Port are first class and will bring glory not only to the community and the state but the entire nation. Meanwhile, the Managing Director of National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA), Senator, (Dr). Adeleke Olorunnimbe Mamora, has promised to improve on staff welfare. He made the promise while delivering a speech at the NIWA 2018 end of year party that took place at the headquarters.
