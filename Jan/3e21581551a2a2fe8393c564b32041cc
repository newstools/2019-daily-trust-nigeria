She made the call yesterday during the North-East zonal women rally of the PDP in Bauchi, which also featured distribution of foods and other gift items to women groups. Mrs. Atiku called on women to vote the PDP in 2019 to curb poverty, unemployment, drug abuse among youths, as well as improve the education sector. She, however, warned against vote buying, reminding the electorate of their civic responsibilities of electing their leaders based on conscience. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Atiku distributed 500,000 chicks, 1,400 packs of macaroni,1,000 bags of rice, among other items. Speaking earlier, the wife of PDP governorship candidate in Bauchi, Hajiya Aisha Mohammed, said that if PDP returned to power in 2019, women and youths issues would be at forefront.
