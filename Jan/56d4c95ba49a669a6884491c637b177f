A House of Representatives member for Abuja South Federal constituency, Rep. Angulu Dobi, has said he plays politics with the fear of Allah in his mind. Dobi stated this when a local miner, Muhammad Saidu Usman, donated banners, posters and other campaign equipment to his constituency office in Gwagwalada on Friday. “If you are lucky to be associated with success at all times, what people say about you is Angulu Dobi is not an ordinary politician, which is not true because I play politics with the fear of Allah,” he said. He commended the miner for donating election campaign equipment to him, even as he urged him to ensure he paid revenue meant for the area council. He called on the council chairman, Alhaji Mustapha Adamu, to ensure he checked the activities of illegal miners in some villages in the area.
