Licensing of foreign technologies by the National Office for Technology Acquisition and Promotion (NOTAP) has fetched the Federal Government N240 billion in six years, the Minister of Science and Technology, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, has said. Dr Onu disclosed this, yesterday, in Abuja when he laid the foundation for the N762 million NOTAP new office complex. He said NOTAP got the money from licensing issuing to owners of foreign technologies which Nigerians have no capacity to develop. He said the agency had been developing Nigeria’s capacity by making sure that no foreign technology is allowed into the country except those Nigerians have no capacity to develop. He said NOTAP was stepping up efforts to give more patents to researchers as technological advancement is measured by the number of patents in the hands of researchers and scientists. He directed NOTAP to collate the data of Nigerian professionals at home and abroad so that government would know the capacity of its citizens in terms of what jobs they can handle and what the foreigners can handle. “We want to industrialise Nigeria in a way that is irreversible. We have started this already by developing the capacity of our researchers. We have made it easy for them to patent their innovations; we have linked them with the market and sooner or later we are going to see the result of all these,’’ he said. In an interview with journalists after the event, the Director General of NOTAP, Dr Dan Azumi Ibrahim, said the building, when commissioned, would boost the capacity of staff. He said the idea to collate the data of Nigerian professionals is to know their competence in order to improve indigenous technologies.
