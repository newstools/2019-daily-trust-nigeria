The Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGANSSAN) has condemned what it described as the lingering anti-labour practices perpetrated by some indigenous oil companies operating in the country against their employees, especially Nigerian workers. Arising from the it’s National Executive Council (NEC) meeting in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State recently, PENGASSAN listed Forte Oil, Seplat, AITEO and NIPCO as amongst the worst abusers of the nation’s labour laws and therefore vowed to resist their nefarious acts on their workers who are also citizens of Nigeria. According to PENGASSAN, these oil and gas companies are notorious in the practice of casualization, contract staffing, outsourcing and off-shoring of jobs as well as other unfair labour practices and under-hand tactics in their labour relations activities. The association, whose membership is organised among senior and middle management staff in the temporary and regular employment in Nigeria’s oil and gas sector, thereby marking it a leading advocate and stakeholder in policy formulations that affect its over 10,000 members on workplace related issues, also accused the companies of refusing to unionise their workers, disrespect for mutually signed collective agreements, persistent intimidation and victimisation of union leaders and members. PENGASSAN also in the statement, signed by its president, Mr Francis Olabode Johnson and General Secretary Lumumba I. Okugbawa, commended the efforts of the Federal Government through the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) at ensuring adequacy and consistent supply of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) throughout the festive season.
