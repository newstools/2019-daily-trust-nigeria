The Peoples Democratic Party Presidential Campaign Organisation (PPCO) has rejected the alleged idea of an interim government being mooted by the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, on behalf of the Presidency. The Director, Media and Publicity of the PPCO, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, said in a statement, yesterday, that the party could not accept any form of unconstitutional governance and a contraption such as interim government. He was reacting to the press conference addressed by Alhaji Lai Mohammed during which he (the minister) alleged that the opposition was planning to instigate crisis across the country to the extent that elections would not be conducted. Mr. Kola said the PDP was confident of a landslide victory during the  February 16 presidential election, given what he described as the overwhelming support that its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, enjoyed from Nigerians. The party said a suggestion of an interim government, under any pretext, context or contemplation could only come from desperate and unpatriotic minds in a “failed administration or political party” that has lost hope of being re-elected in a free, fair and credible election. “Every Nigerian knows the desperation of the APC and the Buhari Presidency ahead of the 2019 general election, leading to their resort to threats, intimidation and clampdown on dissenting voices, as well as assault on institutions of democracy in the face of incontrovertible indices pointing to their imminent crushing defeat at the polls,” he said.
