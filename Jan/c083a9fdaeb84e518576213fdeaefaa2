The Ondo State chapter of the National Automobile Technicians Association, NATA, has declared its support for Dr Olusegun Mimiko’s bid to represent Ondo Central Senatorial district at the Senate in 2019. The former governor of the state is contesting on the platform of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP). President of the Association, Sobande Babatunde, who made the declaration on behalf of the group, said NATA’s support for Mimiko’s senatorial aspiration was in appreciation of the numerous live changing programmes the group enjoyed under his leadership as Ondo state governor. “His care and support for the union when he was Ondo state governor were profound. The ultra modern mechanic village he built for us expanded our trades and ease our jobs operations,” he said. “When it was announced that we all must vacate the road sides for a newly constructed mechanic village, some of us frowned at the idea, thinking of how we will get patronage when we leave roads side, where we still enjoy small patronage, for a general workshop built almost at the city boundary. “But to our surprise, the patronage was massive even ten times more than what we got while risking our lives along the roads. “Customers feel comfortably relaxed, we have more hands to help when in need of expertise, we have needed auto parts at our close reach. Also, security of workshops and Customers’ vehicles were guaranteed. He has our votes.”, Sobande added. The group also acknowledged the former Governor’s intervention in building a befitting secretariat and allocation of soft loans to the group during his time as Ondo state governor. Mimiko, in his remarks, appreciated members of the group for their usual support and reassured them of his commitment to always work to better the lots of his people. 2019: Igoba Community drums support for Mimiko's Senate bid Lessons from the Ondo governorship election Mimiko’s allies defect to APC
