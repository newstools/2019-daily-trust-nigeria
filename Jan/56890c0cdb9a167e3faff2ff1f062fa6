The Ekiti State governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, has donated digital blood pressure monitors to all permanent secretaries and other top government functionaries as a way of encouraging them to pay due attention to their health. Dr Fayemi made the donations at the end of the year get-together programme with the leadership of the civil service, in Ado Ekiti. Noting that health is wealth, the governor said, “Most of the health challenges we have don’t just start in a day. They are products of unattended-to health issues.” Gov Fayemi assured the workers of regular training and retraining of staff, noting that even the best man if not nurtured could become a societal problem. The Deputy Governor, Otunba Bisi Egbeyemi, advised top civil servants in the state to seriously consider life after service and encouraged them to go into farming and other profitable ventures.
