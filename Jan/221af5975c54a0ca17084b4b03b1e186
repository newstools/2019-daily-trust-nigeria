The spokesman of the command, DSP Tyopev Terna, said the Commissioner of Police, Austin Agbonlahor, had immediately assembled a team to the scene of crime, but discovered that the attackers had left the scene. “On the scene of crime, three persons were seen motionless and they were immediately taken to the Barkin Ladi General Hospital where they were confirmed dead by the doctor on duty. Three injured persons were also taken to the hospital out of the three persons that were injured, one of them died while receiving treatment,” he said. He said the other two persons in the hospital were responding to treatment. He advised citizens to go about their lawful businesses and volunteer information that could lead to the timely arrest of the perpetrators.
