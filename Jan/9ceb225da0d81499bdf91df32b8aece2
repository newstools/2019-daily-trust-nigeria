A Director of Administration in Ijero Local Government Council, Mr Olusola Rotimi, is being interrogated at the State Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) following his arrest on Saturday at the council headquarters, where he was allegedly caught attempting to cart away files and vital documents after he had tampered with others. Rotimi, who was said to have sneaked into the council office in Ijero-Ekiti during the period of the monthly environmental sanitation programme, was apprehended while about leaving the office with the files and vital documents. When accosted by the security men attached to the office to disclose what he had in his bag, he said they were his personal belongings. But the security men insisted on searching the bags and discovered that files and other vital documents were concealed in clothes tucked inside the bag. The matter was reported at the Divisional Police Office (DPO) in Ijero, where Rotimi was later detained before the case was transferred to the CIB headquarters in Ado-Ekiti on Sunday. Confirming the arrest, Mr Olayinka Oyebode, the Chief Press Secretary to the Ekiti State governor, said the state government was not unaware of clandestine moves by some individuals to undermine ongoing investigations by the State House of Assembly into the activities of local government administration in the state. The state government has consequently warned civil servants in the state not to, “in their own interest”, get involved in any act that could compromise or frustrate the investigation, and to desist from any act capable of sabotaging the state government’s efforts. The government has reiterated its zero tolerance for fraudulent activities, saying it would ensure offenders face the full weight of the law. Already, the state governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, has directed that security be scaled up around public institutions in the state with a view to checkmating similar occurrences.
