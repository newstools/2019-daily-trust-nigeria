Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong,Â  said his administration was willing to pay any amount agreed as the new minimum wage for workers in the state. He spoke on Tuesday when the state Chapter of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) led a peaceful protest to the Government House in Little Rayfield, Jos to transmit the recommendation of the Tripartite Committee on the new minimum wage for Nigerian workers. The workers who staged a peaceful protest from the Old Airport Junction in Jos, the Plateau State capital with solidarity songs as well as placards with different inscriptions, were protesting the delay in the implementation of the recommendations of the committee by the government . Represented by his deputy, Professor Sonni Tyoden, Governor Lalong commended them for being orderly and matured in their protest.
