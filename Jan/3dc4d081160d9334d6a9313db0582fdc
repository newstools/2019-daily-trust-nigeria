Mr. Hakeem Olusegun Odumosun on Wednesday resumed office as the Edo state Commissioner of Police. Odumosun is replacing CP Johnson Babatude Kokumo who is going to the Nigeria Institute of Policy Strategic Studies (NIPSS). Receiving the new commissioner, Edo state governor, Godwin Obaseki, charged him to use the new State Security Architecture, to fight crime in the state to the barest minimum. “We are building an emergency response centre to be ready in the quarter of this year. For now, we will set up a temporary centre to coordinate all the activities of the operatives under the new security architecture recently launched in the state,” he said. He commended the outgoing Police Commissioner, Johnson Babatunde Kokumo, for his cooperation and support in birthing the security architecture, which has made the state safer for citizens. “We can’t secure the state alone without the support and cooperation of Edo people. The security information management system which Kokumo has helped the state to set up is vital. “All the information in the database will help in understanding the incidence of criminality in the state as well as assist in policing the state,” he added. He however urged the new Commissioner of Police to run a corruption-free command and ensure that the people of the state trust the police force. Earlier, the new CP said his mission in the state is to protect lives and property and ensure the state is safe for all.
