The Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lieutenant General T.Y Buratai and his gallant troops have continued to receive plaudits for the remarkable efforts in clamping down insurgency. A renowned religious group, the National Inter-Faith and Religious Organization for Peace (NIFROP) is the latest to shower encomium on the Nigerian Army under the dogged and charismatic leadership of the COAS. NIFROP, in a press conference, addressed by its President, Bishop Sunday Garuba, on Sunday in Abuja, hailed Lt. Gen Buratai and his relentless troops for their immeasurable sacrifices for the safety and security of the nation. According to the group, the Army’s patriotism came to the fore during end of the year when it seemed as though the Boko Haram terrorist were on the rise again. “We thank God that the Nigerian Army, as usual, rose to the task and chased the terrorists and bandits back to the pit of hell from whence they came. The damage the Nigerian troops inflicted on the terrorists in the past year might have been underreported but patriotic citizens that are interested in the truth are still able to read between the lines to appreciate what has been done on their behalf,” “It is on this note that we identify with troops that have made great sacrifices for the safety and security of the nation, especially those that laid down their lives for their country,” the statement reads. The group vowed to continue supporting the Army in any way whatsoever, including prayers.
