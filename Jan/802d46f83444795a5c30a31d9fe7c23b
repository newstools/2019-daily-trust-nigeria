The presidential candidate of the People’s Trust (PT) for the February 16 presidential election, Mr. Gbenga Olawepo Hashim, has pledged to run an all-inclusive government in order to tackle the political, socio-economic, security and other challenges bedeviling the nation. Speaking with newsmen, yesterday in Abuja, Hashim said rescuing Nigeria was a herculean task which required the input of every available good hand in the country. The presidential hopeful, who said he believed there were good politicians in both the ruling APC and the opposition PDP as well as in the other political parties, added that Nigeria required like-minded people devoid of political linings to rescue it. Hashim said if voted into power, he would put his cabinet in place within 48-hours and that technocrats, experts in the diaspora among other professionals would be considered. He said they would collectively unite the nation, fix its infrastructure, security and economic challenges. “We have the talented people to solve the problems confronting Nigeria both within and outside the country. Only the narrow mindedness and ineptitude of some leaders have prevented the deployment of these enormously great human resources available to this nation. “Our government will include, by the grace of God, forward looking political leaders in the two major political parties and the newly registered parties, technocrats, professional groups, youth, women, patriotic Nigerians in the Diaspora and other interest groups. “There is no scope for small mindedness in this urgent business of national redemption. We shall defeat darkness, hatred and division with love, light and unity,” he said.
