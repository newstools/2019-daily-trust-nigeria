Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Wednesday disclosed that the Federal Government would expand and strengthen the N-Power by increasing its beneficiaries from 500,000 to one million. Osinbajo disclosed this at a town hall meeting organised by the sons and daughters of Remoland at Akarigbo Palace in Sagamu, Ogun State. The VP added that the FG has been  able to stem the tide of employment with the provision of “Tradermoni” and “Marketmoni” through the “N-Power” scheme. He also said that all traders from Remoland, in Ogun East district, have been enumerated and captured electronically through the “Marketmoni”. “Let us key into federal government programmes when they are available”, he said. While responding to the questions from the audience, Osinbajo noted that though the federal government has played its own part in bringing development to Remoland through the provision of an enabling environment. He said the responsibility of establishing a cargo airport rests squarely on the state government. Osinbajo said: “We have federal government’s presence here in Remoland and we can still do more. “We are already constructing the Ikorodu/Sagamu road. It is an important road and the contract for it was awarded six months ago. “And when it is completed, it would help to ease traffic from Ikorodu to Sagamu and also from Sagamu to Ikorodu. “Also, I have good news for you, that you will have a passport office in Remoland and there would not be any need to go to either Lagos or Abeokuta (Ogun state) or Abuja to get international passports. “We are already paying attention to ecological funds and one of the projects is ongoing in Ikenne.” Sallah: Osinbajo says FG is focused on eradicating poverty FG commits N1.7trn to capital investment -Osinbajo FG spent N1.3trn on capital projects in 2016, says Osinbajo
