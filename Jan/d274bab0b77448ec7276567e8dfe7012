A Second Republic Governor of Borno State, Alhaji Mohammed Goni has announced his defection to the All Progressives Congress (APC) from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Goni, 77, who was also the Borno State governorship candidate of the PDP in 2011, announced his defection after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Villa. He visited the president together with some North East politicians including Senator Ali Ndume (APC, Borno South). The former governor told State House Correspondents that he defected to the APC to support the second term bid of President Buhari. He said he decided to support the re-election of Buhari because of his commitment to the development of Nigeria and fight against insurgency. Goni who said Borno State and the entire North East  could be  doomed if President Buhari was defeated in the forthcoming election,  said he would mobilise for the president’s re-election. The former governor, while recalling when Buhari was Governor of North Eastern state, said “I know the president very well, I was the council secretary when he was governor of North East. He is a performer. “ Breaking: Ex- Borno Governor, Goni joins APC, meets Buhari Borno 2019: Sheriff wants to manipulate Buhari, Oshiomhole – Ex-Deputy Governor Buhari’s biggest hurdles ahead 2019 polls
