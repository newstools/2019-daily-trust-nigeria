Out of the 25 governorship candidates of political parties in Cross River State for the 2nd March 2019 governorship election, 16 have unanimously adopted Senator John Owan-Enoh as their consensus candidate. The governorship candidates came out on the platform of Coalition of Owan Friends of Political Parties And Groups (COFOPPAG). The inauguration was done Thursday in Calabar where all the candidates were present. They said they will move their supporters and votes to Owan-Enoh. Coordinating chairman of the coalition, Mr Charles Okoi said they came up with the idea having noted Owan-Enoh as the most formidable, experienced, tested and proven politician, and as one that had the capacity to galvanise desired impact. “We feel that our state, Cross River has been brought down through many dramas and lies of the incumbent. We have agreed to work for and support Owan-Enoh to emerge as governor. “Our intention is to pull all forces and votes to the APC.” Speaking, the APC governorship candidate, Owan-Enoh said he was humbled by the unanimous adoption, promising not to disappoint them. He said he was touched that they set aside their personal ambition for the larger interest of the state.
