The Resource Centre for Human Rights and Civic Education (CHRICED) has expressed apprehension over the unending attacks, as well as the elaborate disinformation campaign being orchestrated by partisan actors against the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The executive director of the centre, Comrade Dr. Ibrahim M. Zikirullahi, said, yesterday, in a statement that while CHRICED was not holding brief for INEC, it was within their patriotic mandate for civic education to point trends in the polity, which posed threats to the credibility of the electoral process. According to him, with barely few weeks to the 2019 general elections, there was no mistaken the fact that the attacks against INEC by some partisan interests were well calculated to achieve sinister objectives, including attempt to undermine voter confidence and the acceptability of the outcome of the polls. “Without mincing words, the latest storm in a tea cup, induced by the reaction of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), to the appointment of Mrs. Amina Zakari as Head of INEC Collation Centre for the 2019 presidential election, is motivated by nothing else, but sheer mischief on the part of the PDP. “If this were not so, objective onlookers would wonder why the PDP insists on misleading the public by deliberately refusing to own up to the fact that the said Mrs. Zakari was actually appointed to INEC by a PDP president, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, and confirmed by a PDP dominated National Assembly. “If a PDP president found the said Mrs. Zakari worthy of appointment as a National Commissioner, on what reasonable basis would the party be questioning her work at INEC, including the latest assignment that she has been saddled with?” Zikirullahi asked.
