The Etsu of Kwali, Alhaji Shaban Audu Nizazo III, has said reading culture among Nigerians is going into extinction due to over concentration on social media. Alhaji Nizazo, stated this at a book launch by the Centre For Gbari Research and Documentation, written by Dr. Midah Kwali Ayuba, held at Kwali town hall on Saturday. He said it was unfortunate that majority of Nigerians, especially the young, have abandoned reading books and concentrated on only social media, adding that there was need for both government and private school teachers to inculcate reading culture in students. “During our days in school, we spent our time in classrooms or libraries to read for at least one or two hours. In fact, we had a competition on reading novels but the situation has changed completely especially among our younger ones,” he said. The traditional ruler described the author of the book as someone with a passion for writing books. Also speaking, a lecturer in the Department of Education of the University of Abuja, who was the book reviewer, Dr. Andy Nesta Philip, said he saw a brand new vision for the development of the Gbari nation with the publication of the book, saying the future of the Gbari speaking people across the country would be a great one. “So if the youth will come back to their senses and embrace what they have and value it, the Gbari culture will not go into extinction,” he added. City News reports that two books were launched; ‘The Legendary Heroine: Dr. Ladi Kwali’ and ‘Gbari Names and their Meanings’. FCT council chairmen tasked on children’s education page 46 page 43
