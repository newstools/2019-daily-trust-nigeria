The Ekiti State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Abuja has adjourned sine die (indefinitely) judgement following the conclusion of hearing of the case. The petition was filed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its governorship candidate, Prof. Kolapo Olusola, against the election of Mr. Kayode Fayemi of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as governor. The chairman of the tribunal, Justice Suleiman Belgore, announced yesterday that the tribunal would communicate the judgment date to the parties 48 hours before the delivery. In their final written address, the petitioners, represented by Yusuf Ali (SAN) urged the tribunal to nullify the election on the ground that Governor Fayemi was not qualified to have stood for the election in July, 2018 because he had been barred from seeking elective office for 10 years on the strength of his indictment by the Justice Oyewole Commission of Inquiry. Ali also argued that justice would be served if the election was nullified because of malpractices like over voting, deliberate voiding of votes meant for the petitioners, among others. However, Governor Fayemiâ€™s lawyer, Prince Lateef Fagbemi (SAN) urged the tribunal to dismiss the petition for being baseless and lacking in merit. He contended that the purported indictment of his client by the commission of inquiry and based on Section 182 had been deleted from the constitution by the first alteration in 2010.
