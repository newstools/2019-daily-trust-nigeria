The Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said seven Houthi prisoners will be released after a Saudi soldier was freed and arrived in Riyadh in a rare exchange of goodwill between combatants in the devastating three-year war. Saudi prisoner Mousa Awaji returned on a Red Cross plane from Sanaa on Tuesday with the rebels. Coalition spokesman Turki al-Maliki said the exchange came because the Houthis did not provide Awaji with proper medical treatment and efforts were under way to end the detention of other prisoners, state media reported.
