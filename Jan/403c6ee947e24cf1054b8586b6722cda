Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has officially announced his defection from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Other defectors from the APC to the PDP were; the lawmaker from Plateau State and Chairman, House Committee on Rules and Business, Edward Pwajork, as well as Ahmed Yerima from Bauchi State. Announcing the defections on the floor of the House during Tuesday’s plenary, Dogara said their defections were due largely to pressures from their constituents, who had lost confidence in the ruling APC. “I, Yakubu Dogara, hereby announce my defection from the APC to the PDP. In my own case, I would say I took the decision because of the wishes of my constituents who bought PDP nomination forms for me on 12 September, 2018,” the Speaker announced. Recall that Speaker Dogara had on September 12, 2018, obtained nominations forms of the PDP under which he is seeking re-election into the Bogoro/Das/Tafawa Balewa Federal Constituency of Bauchi State. Meanwhile, both Pwajork and Yerima are not coming back to the 9th House after failing to secure APC return tickets in the September primaries, which might have prompted their defection few weeks to the general elections.
