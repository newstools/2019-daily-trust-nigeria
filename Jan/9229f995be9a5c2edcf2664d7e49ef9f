The Senate President, Bukola Saraki has raised the alarm that the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Ibrahim Idris was after his life. Saraki who is the Director General of the PDP Presidential Campaign Organisation (PPCO) addressed a press conference this evening in Abuja, where he called on the international authorities to hold Idris responsible if anything bad happened to him or members of his family. Saraki said the IGP has tried “several tricks to implicate” him in some criminal charges, the first being the arrest of some cultists who were being compelled to claim they worked for him. “Later, he went on to the Offa robbery case and politicized the investigation in order to rope me. In the process of forcing suspects to implicate me, the principal suspect died in their custody. He has also not succeeded with that plot. Who knows what else he may have planned?” he asked. The Senate President said, “We need to make it clear to the entire world that now that ward to ward campaigns is about to begin in the state and I am set to participate in that grassroots campaign as I have always done. “Nobody is sure what instructions Mr. Idris has given to the police command in the state. “Thus, the entire world should hold the IGP responsible if anything untoward happens to members of my family and myself.” Offa robbery: IGP receives court order to summon Saraki BREAKING: IGP wants to implicate me, Kwara Gov in criminal scandal — Saraki Offa Robbery: Saraki meets IGP''s investigators in his office
