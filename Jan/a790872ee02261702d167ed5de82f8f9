The Chairman of the Senate Committee on Petroleum (Downstream), Senator Kabiru Marafa (APC, Zamfara Central), has hailed the judgment of a Federal High Court in Abuja which upheld INEC’s rejection of Zamfara APC candidates. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had rejected the list of candidates submitted by a faction of APC in Zamfara State over the party’s failure to conduct primaries. Marafa, in a reaction to the court judgment delivered on Friday by Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu, said it had ended the political dynasty that brought in Governor Abdulaziz Yari as governor of Zamfara State. The court had held that the INEC acted within its powers by refusing to accept list of candidates for the next general elections from a faction of the APC in Zamfara State. Justice Ojukwu, in a judgment on Friday, said it was not the fault of INEC that the APC failed to conduct a valid primary within the period scheduled by the electoral body. Ojukwu said INEC’s action was intended to curb impunity among political parties and politicians; ensure that rule of law is adhered to. The judgment was on a suit filed in the name of APC by some individuals, who said they emerged from a consensus arrangement adopted by the party in Zamfara State. Meanwhile, Marafa has said that he would challenge the judgment of a Zamfara State High Court, affirming that primaries were conducted by the Yari-led APC faction in the state.
