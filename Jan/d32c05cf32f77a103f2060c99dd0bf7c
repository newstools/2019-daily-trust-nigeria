The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) has pledged to grow the contribution of the manufacturing sector to Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from 9.5 percent to 15 percent. MAN’s president, Engr. Mansur Ahmed, made the pledge at the 2019 media luncheon in Lagos, yesterday. Ahmed said the association will strive to appreciably increase the capacity utilization of member-companies by promoting policy consistency in a manner that the gains already made are not pulled back while ensuring the revival of sectors that are currently struggling. He said: “We will promote a more inclusive economy among all categories of companies in the membership of MAN through the establishment of structured and mutually beneficial linkages between the large corporations group and small and medium industries.” Speaking on the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCTA), Ahmed said  MAN, being a proactive organisation that strongly believed in evidence-based advocacy, has commissioned a sector specific study on AfCFTA. He said: “We have shared the study, full report and fact sheets on the highlights of findings with the Presidential Committee on AfCFTA. “We are confident that the eventual position of Nigeria on the AfCFTA Framework Agreement would be well articulated in a fresh national negotiation mandate that is in the best interest of the manufacturing sector and indeed the Nigerian economy while paying utmost attention to emerging issues on AfCFTA and ensuring that the industrial aspiration of the country is not compromised on the platter of free trade.” 2010: The year of poor power supply to manufacturers New MAN president pledges collaboration with FG on competitiveness Nigeria’s food import grow at 11% every year
