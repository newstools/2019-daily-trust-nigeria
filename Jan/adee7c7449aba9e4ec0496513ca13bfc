Presenting a scorecard of the bank’s performance in its first year of operation to the media in Lagos, Okpanachi said the DBN formally commenced lending operations in October, 2017, to its first two Participating Financial Institutions (PFI)-micro finance banks. He noted that with a strong on-boarding exercise it carried out within the year, the bank currently had a total of 29 PFIs, which included commercial banks at various stages of engagement. “Our total disbursement to date stands at N31.364bn, thus exceeding our year-end projection of N30bn. Total number of end borrowers stands at 35,000, which also exceeded our year-end target of 20,000 MSMEs. “Women accounted for 73 per cent of the end-borrowers of the DBN loans and received 27 per cent of the total amounts disbursed,” he added. Spurred by the achievements attained in its first year of operations, Okpanachi hinted that the bank’s disbursement target for 2019 had increased to N70bn and was expected to help deepen the bank’s penetration in the MSMEs sector of the economy. As a proof of the bank’s professionalism, the DBN boss also noted that the bank had been recommended for various ISO certifications such as Information Security-ISO 27001; Business Continuity-ISO 22301 and IT Service Management-ISO 20000.
