The chairman, Publicity Committee of Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje Campaign Organisation, Malam Muhammad Garba, said, yesterday, that ex-governor Rabiu Kwankwaso did not seek re-election for the Senate because he is afraid of defeat by former Governor Ibrahim Shekarau. Garba who is the commissioner of Information in Kano State, said this during Ganduje’s campaign tour in Karaye Local Government Area. He described Senator Kwankwaso as “a spent force who is no longer relevant politically.” “Senator Kwankwaso saw the handwriting on the wall and tactically withdrew, because he is afraid of being disgraced at the polls by His Excellency, Malam Ibrahim Shekarau, Sardaunan Kano. “You can recall how Shekarau dealt with him in 2003 and 2007 when he defeated him as a sitting governor and also defeated his preferred governorship candidate in the 2007 governorship elections. “Kwankwaso’s utterances in recent times depict that of a defeatist who is aware that he has lost touch with the realities in Kano politics,” he said. Garba said the “depletion of his Kwankwasiyya Movement and the gale of defection by former chieftains of the movement to our great party, the APC are also pointers to the fact the former governor and his governorship candidate have already lost out even before the election.” Faces eyeing Kwankwaso’s seat Where is Malam Shekarau?
