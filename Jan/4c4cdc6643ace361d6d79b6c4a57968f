The Joint Security Task Force, made up of officers of the Nigerian Army, police and other security agencies the Ondo State government set up to curb insecurity in the state, has arrested seven persons from different gangs of suspected kidnappers. Some of those the task force paraded yesterday at the Ondo State police command headquarters were said to have been arrested at the Emure-Ile junction, via the Owo-Akure road. The Army Public Relations Officer for Owena Cantonment, Major Ojo Adenegan, and the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mr Femi Joseph, told journalists that the suspects were arrested at their hideout inside the Emure-Owo forest. Also arrested was a man Joseph described as the kidnappers’ informant who was monitoring the operations of the task force. The police spokesman disclosed that about 20 guns, 15 daggers, 15 cutlasses and other dangerous weapons, as well as charms, a sum of N27,820 and clothing materials were recovered from the suspects. The  police also said that two suspected weed planters identified as Friday Ami and Sunday Femi, who allegedly assassinated a 75-year-old woman, Mrs Modupe Olorunfemi, at her Owo farm last year, have been arrested. Joseph said Ami and Femi assassinated the septuagenarian in February 2017, accusing her of giving security operatives information about their nefarious planting and selling of Indian hemp in the Owo area. He promised the suspects would be charged to court as soon as investigations were concluded.
