The management of Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) says the company has perfected plans to cut Aggregate Technical, Commercial and Collection (ATC&C) losses to less than 20 per cent in 2019. KEDCO’s Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Dr Jamilu Isyaku Gwamna, made the disclosure, yesterday, while speaking to newsmen in Kano. Dr Gwamna said it would be difficult for the company to meet the N48 billion target if such losses were not reduced. He said the company’s focus in 2019 is to reduce its aggregate Technical, Commercial and Collection losses to less than 20 per cent amongst other things toward achieving its target. “We must cut losses to the barest minimum to achieve our target in 2019 so as to sustain our robust role of workers welfare as well as keep up with our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in different communities. “The analytical assessment carried out by our team shows that losses through vandalism, equipment sabotage, energy theft, non-payment of bills and other unfriendly acts were gulping money from the company that could have boosted our revenue. “As far as 2019 is concerned, we are poised to blocking all loopholes which may prevent us from achieving our target of N48 billion,’’ he stated.
