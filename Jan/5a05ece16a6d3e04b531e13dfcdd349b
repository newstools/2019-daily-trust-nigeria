A former PDP presidential aspirant, Dr. Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed, has said a fraudulently elected government is simply a civilian coup. Baba-Ahmed said this on Thursday in Abuja as one of the lead speakers at the 16th Daily Trust Dialogue themed: “Youth and Democracy: The Nigerian Challenge”. He added that nothing demeaned democracy like electoral fraud. He voiced concern that majority of those who engaged in vote buying and selling that had been accepted as normal act were the Nigerian youths.

He wondered why the youths who were elected into position of authority had continued to sustain the old order of absolute loyalty to their political leaders. “Vote buying appears to be accepted. Buyers are portrayed as valiant. And majority of vote buyers are Nigerian youths. “Nigerian youths are beneficiaries of wrong narratives. They are victims of sustained misgovernance,” he said. He stressed the need to entrench democracy in the country in order to serve its purpose and advised against rigging the next general elections.
