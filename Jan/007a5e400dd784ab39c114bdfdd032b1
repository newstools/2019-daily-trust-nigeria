The governor of Imo State and Chairman, Progressives Governors’ Forum, Owelle Rochas Okorocha, has urged Nigerians to be positive about 2019. He noted that 2019 would favour Nigeria more than previous years. The governor, in his New Year message, said no nation could grow with the citizenry being negative about its progress. He therefore called on Nigerians to see light at the end of the tunnel with regard to 2019 especially on the nation’s politics, economy, unity and development. He noted that year 2018, which had just ended, was not a bad year when properly scrutinised. Okorocha, therefore, urged Nigerians to be grateful to God for his goodness in 2018 and also pray that 2019 would be better. He assured Imo people that his government would continue to work till the end of his tenure in May, 2019, saying his administration had surpassed its target.
