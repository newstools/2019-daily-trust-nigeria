Residents of the Mangoro-Agege areas of Lagos state where a train derailed on Thursday morning have blamed the incident on negligence on the part of the Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC). They said the incident would not have occurred if the NRC officials have fixed part of the rail tracks that was faulty. Many travellers were reportedly trapped when two coaches on the train derailed from its tracks around Ashade Ram Market, near Mangoro Bus stop, in Agege area of Lagos. It was however learnt that the incident was a minor one as only one person was injured and was given first aid treatment at the scene.
