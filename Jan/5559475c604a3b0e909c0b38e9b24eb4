The winners of the 11th Daily Trust African of the Year Award have arrived Abuja yesterday. The schoolgirls, Stacy Owino, Purity Achieng, Ivy Akinyi, Synthia Otieno and Macrine Atieno, from the western Kenyan city of Kisumu, won the $25,000 award for developing a mobile application called “I-cut.” The application has become a very useful tool in the war against Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). The girls were Africa’s only representatives at Google’s 2017 Technovation Challenge which took place in Silicon Valley, California, USA. The girls’ team leader, Stacy Owino and their manager, Dorcas Owino were received at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja by Media Trust’s head of brand marketing, Mrs Gift Ilesanmi and Imam Nma Shuaib, protocol officer. Stacy Owino would receive the award on behalf of the team at a dinner to be held today at the Shehu Musa Yar’adua Centre, Abuja by 7:30pm. The event is strictly by invitation. Daily Trust African of the Year Award, which attracts a prize sum of $25,000, was instituted by Media Trust Limited to celebrate ordinary Africans who are doing extraordinary things in their chosen fields of endeavour. The works of such individuals are usually unique and have an impact across their immediate environment and Africa as a whole.
