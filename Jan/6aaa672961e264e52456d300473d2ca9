A civil rights activist and legal practitioner, Kayode Ajulo has written to the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof Mahmoud Yakubu over the conduct of the elections in Ondo State. In a letter to INEC which was made available to Daily Trust, Ajulo argued that the Action Alliance (AA) party did not conduct any primary and therefore does not have a candidate for this year’s general election. He citing the case of the APC in Zamfara State whose failure to conduct primaries within the time stipulated by the law denied it the opportunity to have a candidate for the general elections in line with the provisions of the Electoral Act. “Please note that the law clearly states that all parties must submit their list of candidates to your commission not later than sixty (60) days before the date of any election and further states that parties can substitute the names of candidates before the deadline for final submission of names; only when they have conducted primaries that is duly observed and certified by INEC,” he wrote. “We have it on good authority that the Action Alliance (AA) in Ondo State has not complied with any of these provisions in the Electoral Act; thereby forfeiting the legal right to field candidates in Ondo State in the 2019 general elections,” he said.
