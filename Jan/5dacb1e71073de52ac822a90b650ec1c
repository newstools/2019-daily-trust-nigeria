The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) vice presidential candidate, Mr Peter Obi, has taken swipe on the Tradermoni social investment programme for market traders by the All Progressives Congress led Federal Government, as mere jamboree and futile effort. Obi advised the APC administration to take a cue from the job and wealth creation initiative of the Delta State Government, under Governor Ifeanyi Okowa led administration. The PDP vice presidential flag bearer, who expressed delight at the sight of skills already acquired by over 4,250 youths trained under the states. Skills Training and Entrepreneurship Programme (STEP), Youth Agricultural Entrepreneurs Programme (YAGEP) and Graduate Employment Enhancement Programme (GEEP), said the onus is on the Federal Government to create jobs for the teeming unemployed youths scattered across the country. Obi, who made a brisk show at the Cenotaph, venue of the exhibition show of fledgling entrepreneurs in Asaba, 24-25 January, charged beneficiaries to use their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) to vote out a nonperforming ruling APC during the forthcoming general elections. He said, “In the world over, unemployment cannot be stopped without supporting entrepreneurs. You cannot compare job creation scheme with trader-moni of the Federal Government. While N10,000 tradermoni is a waste of time. “Job creation entrepreneurship is a wealth establishment venture. Federal Government needs to come to Delta state and learn from its people-oriented programmes for it to become a national issue”, he stated.
