Thugs have destroyed the billboards, posters and banners of the PDP senatorial candidate for Kebbi Central, Alhaji Abubakar Shehu, popularly known as Abu Geda in Gwandu, Jega and Liman Zangina areas of Birnin Kebbi. Shehu, who lamented the destruction of his banners and billboards in three local government areas (LGAs), told Daily Trust that he was happy with the prompt intervention of the security agencies who arrested the suspects. The former secretary general of Gwandu Emirate said two people were apprehended in Jega, one in Gwandu and another at Liman Zangina areas of Birnin Kebbi while destroying his billboards and banners. He said, “Kebbi is a peaceful state, I am a law abiding citizen. I am going to the Senate to make laws for this country. I call on the leadership of the APC to caution whoever is behind this. The destruction of posters, banners and billboards has not happened in Kebbi South, it does not happen in Kebbi North, it is happening only in Kebbi Central. I know that the supporters of Buhari are not the ones destroying my billboards and banners. I also know that the supporters of Governor Bagudu are not behind it. I know who is behind it.” He said the culprits had been charged to court. Thug kills APC member in Kebbi LG General Bamaiyi’s sister attacked in Zuru ‘poster war’ Those who want Bagudu’s job in Kebbi
