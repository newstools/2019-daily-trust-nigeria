The chairman of the Board of Directors of Media Trust Limited, Malam Kabiru Yusuf, has raised alarm over the growing threat Nigerian youths posed during political campaigns and elections. He said the huge number of youths, who are mainly unemployed or trying to eke out a living in the informal economy, are easily mobilised as thugs by politicians during elections. Yusuf, who stated this in a welcome address at the 16th Daily Trust Dialogue on Thursday in Abuja, called for urgent action to engage the youth. The theme of the Dialogue is: ‘Youth and Democracy, the Nigerian Challenge.’ “The youth segment of our population are easily mobilised to become enforcers and thugs for politicians who use force rather than persuasion to win election,” he said.

These are potential cannon fodder. “We must devise ways to give them jobs and hope. Only then can we realistically call on them to be good citizens,” he said. Yusuf expressed confidence in the panel of speakers to examine the theme of the Dialogue. The Dialogue is chaired by Prof Jibrin Ibrahim, Senior Fellow of the Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD). Other speakers are: a former presidential aspirant, Dr Datti Yusuf Baba-Ahmed; Special Adviser to the President on Social Investment Plan, Mrs Maryam Uwais; and the coordinator of the Not Too Young to Run movement, Samson Itodo.
