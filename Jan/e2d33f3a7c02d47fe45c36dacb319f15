The Senate Minority Leader, Senator Biodun Olujimi, has accused former Governor Ayodele Fayose of hijacking Atiku Abubakar Campaign Council in Ekiti State by allegedly injecting his cronies in all strategic positions. In a petition to the National Chairman of the PDP, Chief Uche Secondus, Olujimi called on the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party to disband and reconstitute the council. The senator urged Secondus to compel Fayose to adhere strictly to the resolution reached by stakeholders at a stakeholders’ meeting held in Ado Ekiti on December 28, 2018 on how the council should be composed to forestall cracks and crisis in the party ahead of the general elections. In the petition dated January 6, 2019, the senator argued that only immediate dissolution of the highly ‘lopsided’ campaign council could avert unnecessary cleavages in Ekiti PDP, warning that failure to accede to the request could dim the party’s chances in the state. Of particular reference, she alluded to a publication in a newspaper wherein changes were made to the membership of the Atiku/Obi Campaign Council for Ekiti State without notifying the stakeholders, describing such as “demeaning and mischievous.” She said, “The original composition had Prof. Olusola Kolapo as chairman, Otunba Yinka Akerele as director general and Chief Sanya Atofarati as spokesperson/director of media among others while the position of secretary did not exist in the original composition by the national directorate.” But the composition that Olujimi was rejecting, had Prof. Olusola as chairman, Chief Dipo Anisulowo as DG, Chief Gboyega Oguntuase as secretary: Jackson Adebayo as spokesperson and Lere Olayinka as director, media and publicity.” Olujimi warned that the PDP might lose the state to APC despite what she described as the people’s resolve to vote against the ruling party.
