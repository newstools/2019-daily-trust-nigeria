The National Chairman of African Democratic Congress, Chief Ralphs Nwosu, has called on the National Assembly to declare Senate President Bukola Saraki president of Nigeria with immediate effect. Nwosu, who made the call in a statement signed and issued, yesterday, by Yemi Kolapo, ADC National Publicity Secretary, said the action was necessary considering the fact that recent happenings, especially the alleged ridiculing of the constitution by President Muhammadu Buhari, indicated that he could no long continue to rule the nation. He said all what he described as blunders against Nigeria’s fledgling democracy indicated that the president and his vice, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, were no longer capable of staying in office. He said the Presidency had no right to remove or suspend the head of the Judiciary arm of government without due process, adding that the president had committed a grave offence against the nation. He also said it would be less reckless for the legislature to take over power from this government without necessarily going through any impeachment procedure. “The National Assembly should declare the Senate president, Dr. Bukola Saraki, president,” Nwosu said.
