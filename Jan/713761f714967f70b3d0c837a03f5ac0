The Secretary, Area Councils Secretariat of the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), Senator Isah Maina, has said the secretariat has identified six communities in the territory that are having chieftaincy disputes. Maina, who was speaking with newsmen in Abuja, yesterday, identified Lugbe, Jahi and Pyakasa in Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) and Ashara and Wako under Kwali area council, as some of the communities having chieftaincy disputes. He also said there were Igbo and Ebira communities in the FCT with similar disputes and assured that they would all be addressed by the secretariat. He explained that the secretariat had intensified dialogue and mediation to resolve disputes, saying the need to wade into the chieftaincy crises became urgent to avert violence such as was witnessed in Bwari Area Council in 2017. He stated that security and public peace were needed for development in any given society, hence the secretariat would ensure that all impending chieftaincy matters in the rural areas were amicably resolved. “The secretariat has proactively intervened in resolving series of such chieftaincy disputes by organizing community dialogue with support of community elders,” he said.
