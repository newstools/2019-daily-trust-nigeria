The Federal Government has approved the commercial release of Genetically Modified (GM) beans developed by some Nigerian scientists, officials said yesterday. The pest resistant beans, developed over a 10-year period, is expected to double the farmers’ yields and increase their revenue, Prof Mohammed Ishiyaku of the Institute of Agricultural Research (IAR) Zaria, Kaduna State, who is Principal Investigator of the GM cowpea project, said. Speaking at a press conference in Abuja to announce the commercial release of the GMO beans, Prof Ishiyaku said it is capable of protecting itself against attack by Maruca or pod-borer whose attack lower yields by between 70 and 80%. It will also provide farmers with an alternative to costly and hazardous insecticide spraying, he added. The GM process, he said, entailed transferring the Bt gene, which confers resistance to the pod, into improved cowpea varieties. Also speaking at the conference, the Acting Director General of National  Biotechnology Development Agency (NABDA), Prof Alex Akpa, said Nigeria’s beans production was under threat as the country was already experiencing demand deficit of over 500,000 tons while national productivity average has stagnated at 350kg/hectare. “Our primitive agricultural practices are facing various challenges and from what we are seeing all over the world, science and technology holds the key to overcoming these challenges,’’  Prof Akpa also said. He said GM rice would soon be released into the market in commercial quantity. The Nigerian coordinator of Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology in Africa, Dr Rose Gidado, said the commercial release of the cowpea would boost Nigeria’s foreign exchange reserve. She said the GM beans “is very safe for consumption and will solve the malnutrition problem in the country.’’ GM beans hit market in 2018 Researchers develop  pod-borer resistant beans Agency holds hearing ahead of commercialisation of GMO beans
