The President of National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), Bello Bala Shagari, has said handlers of the APC campaign should be wary of fake youth leaders and their endorsement of President Muhammadu Buhari. Bello who stated this, yesterday, debunked a news item attributed to the association, saying one Sukubo Saraigbe Sokubo had gathered some people to endorse the candidacy of the incumbent president. Shagari said: “It has been brought to our attention that some people led by one Sukubo Saraigbe Sokubo have gathered somewhere to endorse the candidacy of President Muhammadu Buhari in the name of the National Youth Council of Nigeria. We hereby disassociate ourselves with them and their endorsement. We also wish to state categorically clear that we have nothing against the president and we will continue to work for the progress of this administration. “It is pertinent to note, that the National Youth Council of Nigeria as an umbrella body of the Nigerian youth is a non-partisan organisation and thereby cannot indulge in partisan politics. It is unconstitutional and unethical. It will be unfair to do so on behalf of the entire Nigerian youth without consulting the young people of Nigeria who belong to different political parties,” he said. 2019: We are not available for thuggery - Youth council Endorsements that will shape 2019 polls 2019: Sokoto students deny endorsing Buhari
