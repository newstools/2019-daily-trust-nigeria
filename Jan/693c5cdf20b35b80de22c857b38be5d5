The Katsina State Urban Planning and Development Authority (KUPDA) has warned political parties against indiscriminate erection of billboards and pasting of campaign posters in the state. The General Manager, KUPDA, Usman Nadada, gave the warning at a sensitisation meeting with representatives of the parties and other stakeholders. He said the board was disturbed at the indiscriminate erection of billboards and pasting of posters by politicians across the state. According to him, many of the parties are violating the provisions of the law governing erection of billboards and other enlightenment posters which the authority will not condone. “First and foremost parties are not allowed to erect any political advert without a written approval from the authority as dictated under section 83 (subsection 1 and 2 ) of the law cap no. 2 of January 2011, Katsina state law. “Other places prohibited are palaces of emirs, district heads, mosques, security areas, monuments and grave yards. There should also not be any political advert at roundabouts, u-turns and road intersections” the General Manager said. He said parties were not allowed to erect or place their posters close to a rival party’s posters. Nadada said meeting was aimed at sensitising them on what was required before embarking on such exercise. Arewa Trust reports that recently some government agencies embarked on seizure and removal of several billboards across the state with some political parties protesting against the action. The meeting  was attended by representatives of, political parties, security agencies and  traditional rulers, among others.
