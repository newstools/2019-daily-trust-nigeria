A Kubwa Grade 1 Area Court in Abuja yesterday remanded a 56-year-old businessman, Mallam Ya’u, in prison for misappropriation. The judge, Ibrahim Balarabe, ordered Ya’u’s remand after he had pleaded guilty to charges of criminal breach of trust, misappropriation and cheating. Balarabe, however, adjourned Ya’u’s sentencing until Jan. 21, for the value of the parts of the machine he sold to be ascertained. Ya’u, who pleaded guilty to the charges, begged for leniency. The prosecutor, Babajide Olanipekun, had told the court that one Okpanachi Wilfred of Kubwa, Abuja reported the matter at the Kubwa Police Station on Jan. 9. He said the complainant entrusted a groundnut oil processing machine valued at N2 million to Ya’u to keep for him on Nov. 25, 2018. Olanipekun said Ya’u acted in a fraudulent manner and sold some parts of the machine and converted the money to his personal use without the complainant’s consent. He added that the offences contravened sections 312, 309 and 322 of the Penal Code. (NAN)
