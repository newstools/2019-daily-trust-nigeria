The Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, has described the current security challenges in the country as very complex. Abubakar was addressing newsmen weekend after delivering a lecture at the Air Force War College in Makurdi to mark the institution’s Strategic Leadership Week. “The kind of challenges we face in 21st century are very complex and for you to be part of the process of resolving those challenges, of providing solutions to those challenges, you must have knowledge, for without knowledge, one cannot achieve anything meaningful,” he said. He noted that the War College was established to train senior military officers who had done extremely well in their national defence college programme. He said: “I think with what we have done here, we have laid the right foundation for them (participants) to acquire what they require to be able to disect complex issues that they might likely face in the future. From what I have seen, we made the right decision in 2016 by establishing this college.” Military progressing in nation's security - Chief of Air Staff NAF to recruit 1,500 in 2016 Air Chief orders commanders to comply with professional code
