 The Chairman of Abaji Area Council, Alhaji Abdulraman Ajiya, has commissioned the newly established timber market located on Toto road, in the area. Ajiya, while commissioning the timber market said it was unprecedented not only under his administration but in the entire political history of the council. He said it was the first time that the council would be having a timber market, even as he appreciated the former chairman of the council, Alhaji Musa Yahaya Muhammad, for conceiving the idea of establishing a the market. He said there was delay in the takeoff of the timber market due to land dispute between Abaji and Kuje councils. He however said the land dispute had been resolved in favour of Abaji area council which then paved way for the establishment of the market. “When the issue of the land dispute came up, I quickly swung into action by meeting my Kuje counterpart where we both met here and resolved the land dispute. And I want to clear everybody’s mind that today, this land where timber market is sited belongs to Abaji area council,” he said. Also speaking, the former chairman of the council, Alhaji Musa Yahaya Muhammad, commended the council chairman for his efforts to key into establishing a timber market in the area. He cautioned the timber dealers against indiscriminate tree felling, saying as they cut down trees, they should make efforts to plant new ones. “I will also like to counsel us about the effect of deforestation as whenever we are falling down one tree, we should be ready to plant 50 more trees,” he said. The chairman of Timber Traders Union in the area, Mr. Raymond Agu, commended the efforts of the past and present administrations in establishing the market.
