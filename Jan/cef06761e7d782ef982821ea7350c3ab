The Solid Minerals Miners, Traders, Quarry Operators and Sand Dredgers Association says mining can take Nigeria out of the doldrums. The association, in conjunction with Miners for Buhari/Osinbajo (M4BO) spoke through its chairman and former governor of Bauchi State, Alhaji  Isa Yuguda, at a press conference held in Abuja Friday. Yuguda said as a result of the enabling policies/reforms that were brought in by this administration in the mining sector, over 5 million miners are in the field and taking mining as a profession. He stated that due to more activities in the sector, revenue generation improved from N2.08 billion in 2015 to N3.92 billion in 2017, adding that this government has established the Artisanal and Small Scaling Financing Support Fund of N5 billion for artisanal miners. “Miners in Nigeria have come together to support the programmes of President Muhammadu Buhari and to succeed in his reelection bid in the forthcoming general elections to enable them continue with the very good works they have been carrying out in the mining industry,” Yuguda said. The president, Quarry Owners Association, Alhaji Nasir Ibrahim, said the government of President Muhammadu Buhari has helped develop the mining sector, hence should be returned for another term in office.
