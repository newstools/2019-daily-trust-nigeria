The Senate on Thursday commenced debate on the National Minimum Wage Bill. The debate commenced immediately after the Senate received the bill from President Muhammadu Buhari. The letter on the bill was read at Thursdayâ€™s plenary by Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu. In the letter, Buhari requested the Senate to expedite action on the passage of the bill. Daily Trust recalls that the Council or States had on Tuesday approved a national minimum wage of N27,000. However, the Federal government promised to pay N30,000 to federal workers. Senators had to suspend their relevant rules to allow for the first and second readings of the bill. They are expected to refer the bill to the relevant committees of the Senate for further action.
