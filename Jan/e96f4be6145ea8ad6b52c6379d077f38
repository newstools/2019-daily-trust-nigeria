Following relentless efforts by scammers to defraud members of the public in the name of Civil Defence recruitment, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps is calling on members of the public especially desperate job seekers to be wary of antics of fraudsters. Speaking on the worrisome menace of job racketeers, Kaduna State Commandant of the corps, Alhaji Modu Bunu, said the call has become necessary in spite of previous warnings to prevent ‘desperate’
unemployed persons from been defrauded. According to the Commandant, the warning is imperative due to a social media advert stating that government has approved recruitment of 40,000 persons, comprising graduates and non-graduates. The publication which enjoined applicants to go online and fill recruitment forms according to Bunu is not only false, but dubious, mischievous and deliberate design to smear the reputation of the corps. ‘Those who are interested in joining the NSCDC should wait for adverts in national dailies and shun what is being circulated on social media because for now the corps is neither recruiting nor conducting replacement exercise. ‘The fake social media publication reads in part: “FG approves immediate 10,000 Graduate and 30, 000 Non Graduate recruitment at Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps.” He further said that, careful investigations have revealed that the site provided for the alleged scandalous exercise does not even exist.
