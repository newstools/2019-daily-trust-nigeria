The striking Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) yesterday begged President Muhammadu Buhari to show mercy on university students by quickly meeting the demands of the union. ASUU has been on strike since November 5, 2018. The union, in a release signed by the chairman of the University of Ibadan chapter, Dr Deji Omole, described the call by the Labour Minister, Chris Ngige, on the union to have mercy on students and call off its strike as “a merciless utterance”. According to Omole,  the statement by the minister exposed the federal government insincerity. He stated: “Nigerians should join us to beg President Buhari to meet our demands on time rather using keep them talking approach”.
