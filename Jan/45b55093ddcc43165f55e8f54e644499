The Ohanaeze Ndigbo has said that heavens would not fall if it does not support or adopt any presidential candidate in next month’s presidential election. It said even if it decides to remain silent on the issue of adopting any candidate, no one can drag it to court on that ground. In an exclusive interview with Daily Trust in Enugu yesterday, the spokesman of the association, Chucks Ibegbu, said the group had re-stated its resolve to strongly support any candidate whose key agenda is to genuinely restructure the country so that it could make reasonable progress, noting that no two candidates could have exactly the same view on how to restructure the nation.
