The governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State, Buruji Kashamu has rejected the constitution of another PDP Presidential Campaign Organisation (PPCO) for the state under the chairmanship of his arch-rival, Oladipupo Adebutu, describing  the new body as fake. In a statement he issued on Wednesday in Ijebu-Igbo, Ogun State, Kashamu, who represents Ogun East Senatorial District at the Senate, said the authentic PPCO, is the one he heads as the chairman, which was inaugurated by the Adebayo Dayo-led state Executive of the PDP last year. He said his choice as the chairman of the PPCO in Ogun state was informed by the fact that “he is the party’s governorship candidate with a solid structure and functional offices across the state.” Daily Trust reports that both Adebutu and Kashamu are at the loggerheads over the PDP gubernatorial ticket and had in turn constituted parallel PPCOs to campaign for PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, in the state. Kashamu urged the security agencies and the national leadership of the party to call Adebutu to order before “his importunate actions plunge the party and state into an unnecessary chaos and crisis.” “The purported inauguration of another PDP PCO by the dissident group within the Ogun state PDP is most unfortunate. One is surprised that this is coming at a time well-meaning stakeholders are preaching reconciliation, peace and unity. “As a lawmaker, he should not portray himself as a lawbreaker. The only PDP chairman known to the law and major stakeholders within the Ogun State PDP is Engr. Adebayo Dayo,” the statement partly read.
