The chairman of the Board of NDDC and former Senate Leader, Senator Victor Ndoma-Egba, has called on the electorate in Cross River State to reciprocate the love President Muhammadu Buhari has shown them by giving him bulk votes next month. He said the president singled out the state and gave her several key federal government appointments which did not happen before. Speaking with journalists in Calabar, Ndoma-Egba said the performance of the president, who despite the low voter support he had in Cross River State in 2015, demonstrated such love and affection for the state by ensuring the ongoing rehabilitation of the Calabar-Ikom-Ogoja highway, as well as the award of the reconstruction of the Calabar-Itu-Ikot Ekpene highway. He added that the president deserved support because he gave Cross River the following appointments: the Head of Service of the Federation, Auditor-General of the Federation, Chief of Naval Staff, Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Chairman of NDDC Board and Director General of the Women Development Centre among others. Senator Ndoma-Egba also disclosed that he was embarking on his political campaign to return to the Senate based on facts, figures and mountains of previous achievements whilst he was a serving senator.
