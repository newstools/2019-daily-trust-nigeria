The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), in Yobe state said it would provide an alternative voting centres for areas identified as inaccessible due to Boko Haram insurgency. The Resident Electoral Commissioner, Alhaji Ahmad Makama, disclosed this on Wednesday, during a stakeholders’ forum meeting at the commission’s headquarters in Damaturu. The REC said that alternative voting centres became necessary after security operatives confirmed that 24 voting areas in Gujba, Gulani and Gaidam local government areas were unsafe for elections. “You know we cannot risk the lives of our staff, the people there or even the security operatives that would defend them. “So far, we are working with political parties and relevant stakeholders to agree with the alternative voting areas so that no one cries fowl,” he said. Makama observed that the collection of Permanent Voter cards (PVCs) was impressive but 69,000 are yet to be collected by their owners. “I’m sure people are waiting for last minute collection but, they should be aware that we are going to closed PVC distribution on February 8, 2019”. He allayed people’s fear on voters’ security during the conduct of the general elections, saying that security operatives would be provided in all the 2,823 polling units across the state. He noted that the meeting was summoned to synergize with the stakeholders to make utmost use of their roles and contributions in the electoral process. He, therefore, implored all the stakeholders that participated in the meeting to convey the information gathered to their people for peaceful conduct of the 2019 general elections.
