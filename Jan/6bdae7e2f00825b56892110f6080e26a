The Managing Director of Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), Mr Usman Gur Mohammed, has decried the liability left for the present government after the previous administration sold off power assets for $5.4 billion with no improvement in the power sector. Mr Mohammed said this when TCN commissioned two units of 60MVA transformers to deliver 96 megawatts (MW) of electricity at the Suleja substation to boost industrial activities in Niger State. While appraising the significant progress the President Muhammadu Buhari administration has made in the sector after inheriting the liability, he said the privatisation was huge liabilities for the present government. He said: “They took everything of the Federal Government and sold everything, and put a contingent liability of $5.4 billion on the country.” With the new transformers, the capacity of the 132/33KV substation has been raised from 66MW to 162MW. The project, which started in June 2016 and completed five months ago, will boost the quality of power supply across 13 towns in Niger and other towns in Kaduna State. Mohammed, who commissioned the facilities along with the Governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, said while power generation is now at 7,000MW, transmission has risen to 8,000MW, noting that what should be fixed is the distribution section of the value chain. “So the only link that should be fixed is the distribution. I want to assure you that in the next level, distribution will be fixed,” he noted. He said a N72bn Distribution Expansion Programme of the Federal Government was ongoing to strengthen some Distribution Companies (DisCos) and that TCN has raised $1.623bn investment to expand the transmission capacity to 20,000MW by year 2021.
