The Serving Overseer of Latter Rain Assembly and former vice presidential candidate of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), Pastor Tunde Bakare, has called for a “unification gathering” of all contending presidential candidates after the presidential election, noting that it will help in salvaging the country. Bakare, in a state of the nation address at Latter Rain Assembly, Lagos, said irrespective of who emerged winner in the election, the candidates must take cognisance of the fact that there was only one presidential seat being contested for by 73 of them. “After the elections, we have a nation to build together,” he admonished. According to him, in “the winner-takes-all-politics, we could be losing the ideas, the brilliance, the institutional memory, and all the strengths required to build a nation. “But beyond the elections, the Buharis, the Atikus, the Moghalus, the Ezekwesilis, the Durotoyes, the Sowores and the like must come together to minimise our weaknesses  and maximise our strengths as one political family with one agenda – nationhood. We can shape a new nation beyond 2019,” Bakare urged. The pastor, who said he belonged to ‘Team Restructuring’, noted that the concept was all that the country needed to get it right. He said the coming together of all the presidential candidates was also part of the maxim being professed by “Team Restructuring.” PDP presidential ticket: Bakare lauds Atiku, says 2019 will be between two eagles Fire razes Bakare’s house 2019: Can Obasanjo’s romance with Yoruba leaders stop Buhari?
