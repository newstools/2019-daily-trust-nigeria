A Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Rivers State, Prince Tonye Princewill has dismissed claims by the Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike regarding his alleged conversation with the Minister of Transportation, Rt. Hon. Rotimi Amaechi. Governor Wike had, at a campaign rally in Eleme, alleged that the Minister of Transportation, in a conversation at Princewill’s resident in Abuja, boosted that he was behind the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Walter Onnoghen’s ordeal. Princewill, in a statement issued in Port Harcourt at the weekend, expressed shock that Governor Wike could descend to a level where he could afford to make bogus claims of non existent conversations. He said he was disappointed “with the lies that the governor fabricated”, saying Rivers people should ignore comments that are completely baseless and absurd. Princewill noted that there was no time such a conversation took place between the Minister and his humble self, stressing that there was no reason for such a high ranking official to spin such lies. He wondered how the Minister of Transportation could be held blamable for the prosecution of the Chief Justice of Nigeria, who he said, had admitted that he forgot to comply with constitution provisions regarding assets declaration.
