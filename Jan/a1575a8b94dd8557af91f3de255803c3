Thousands of All Progressives Congress (APC) members and supporters in Kwara state trooped to the streets of Ilorin on Thursday as the party’s governorship candidate AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq led other candidates to mobilise voters ahead of the general elections. The rally saw thousands of locals lining the streets and lauding the long motorcade and heavy trucks conveying the APC campaigners amid deafening shouts of ‘O To Ge,’ the campaign slogan of the party which means ‘enough is enough’. The rally was also dominated by shouts of Sai Buhari. The campaign train took off from Fate end of the capital city and criss-crossed the densely populated areas like Ipata market, Gambari,  Okelele,  Abayawo, Omoda and peaked at Pakata where the candidates took turn to address the masses. “We are committed to end the tyranny in our state. O To Ge. We will ensure workers are paid their dues at the right time. A government that cannot account for trillions of Naira of public funds cannot expect to be trusted again,” AbdulRazaq told the rally. AbdulRazaq also laughed off a recent claim by Senate President that APC wants to make Kwara a part of the Southwest. “If West means Tinubu, Bukola took Kwara to the West in 2015 when Tinubu was leader of APC. “Their desperate attempt to incite the public against us has failed. Every student of history understands the role my father AGF AbdulRazaq SAN played in 1955 to convince the Willinks Commission on Minorities that Ilorin belonged to the northern region. Where was Saraki in those years?  Where is his sense of history?” he said.
