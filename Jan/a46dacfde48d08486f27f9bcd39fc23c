With weeks before the polls next month, Rotary International District 9125 is intensifying its  campaign to warn youth against violence and vote buying. District 9125 of the international philanthropic club plans to stage series of peace walks and debate among select schools in the FCT. President of FCT Rotary International District 9125 Adeola Adekunle said the awareness was needed in light of the propensity of politicians to use young people as thugs to perpetrate violence during elections. She said the project, slated for February, is tagged ‘Peace and Conflict Resolution Month’ on Rotary’s calendar in order to reach more youth before elections begin. “Rotary is all about peace building and conflict resolution all across the world. We believe that the world will be a better place if there’s peace,” she said in a statement. “Now that election is around the corner, we are preaching peace and advising all and sundry to shun violence. “The youth most especially should not be used as tools anymore. They are our future, our hopes for tomorrow. So, we are calling on them to shun violence.” The first debate among Interact Clubs in the FCT holds this week, on the topic “Youth as Panacea for National Development”. Six schools are vying for the top prize. Rotary launches school debate to counter election violence Asokoro Rotary Club embarks on tree planting in FCT Page 6 Monday August 17
