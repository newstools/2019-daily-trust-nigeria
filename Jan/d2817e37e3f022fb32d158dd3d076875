The Chairman of Association of Licensed Telecommunications Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), Gbenga Adebayo, has advised MTN Nigeria to pay the revised N50,000,000 Social Services Contribution Levy (SSCL) to the Kogi State revenue agency and seek legal redress in court afterwards. Mr. Adebayo, who made this known in a statement, yesterday, advised both parties to prioritize national interest or always explore dialogue or seek legal resolution of contentious matters. He also reported that the Nigerian Communications Commission had similarly advised MTN to pay the revised sum and seek legal redress. Kogi State Internal Revenue Service (KGIRS) sealed MTN sites in the state capital and other locations on Tuesday last week over claims that MTN had refused to pay the N120,000,000 Social Services Contribution Levy (SSCL) due to the state in 2017 and 2018. The state government had reviewed the total figure down to N50 million during the course of discussions with MTN. MTN on the other hand has repeatedly claimed that the levy was illegal because it was arbitrarily fixed by the state government even though the powers to determine such rates resided with the Hon. Minister of Finance, as contained in the Taxes and Levies Act. He said: “We would like to remind all stakeholders that telecommunications facilities play very important roles in security and economy, hence their classification as, Critical National Infrastructure (CNI).” “As the general elections approach the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) will rely on telecommunications faci-lities of all GSM Operators to transmit election results across the country for collation. The nation cannot afford to have running disputes between telecommunications operators and state governments.” Kogi denies shutting down 150 telecom stations MTN protests shutdown of its facilities by Kogi govt NCC to meet Kogi officials as MTN protests facilities shutdown
