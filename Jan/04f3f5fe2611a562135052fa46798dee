A former Governor of Bauchi State, Malam Isa Yuguda, has said his group will mobilise five million voters to support President Muhammadu Buhari’s re-election bid. Yuguda, who is the chairman of the group, Miners for Buhari/Osinbajo (M4BO), said the effort of the President Buhari-led administration in the mining sector was taking Nigeria out of doldrums, hence the resolve of miners to support the government. At a press briefing in Abuja, Yuguda said, “Based on series of consultation, we have seen the need for miners in Nigeria to come together and support the programme of President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Prof. Yemi Osinbajo to succeed in the forthcoming general elections,” he said. Yuguda said as a result of the enabling policies/reforms that were brought in by this administration in the mining sector, over five million miners had taken to the field. The convener of the event, Alhaji Saleh Katsina, said revenue generation in the mining sector had improved from N2.08bn in 2015 to N3.92bn in 2017.
