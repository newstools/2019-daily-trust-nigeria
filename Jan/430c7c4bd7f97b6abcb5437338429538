The National Chairman of the APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, yesterday, begged President Muhammadu Buhari to probe ex- President Olusegun Obasanjo. Oshiomhole spoke in Damaturu during the launch of President Buhari’s second term bid. He urged Buhari to prove all the alleged mismanagement perpetrated by Obasanjo when he the president. Oshiomhole said Obasanjo who ruled Nigeria for thirteen years should be held responsible for 65 per cent  of sins committed against the country and its people. “He (Obasanjo) introduced corruption into the National Assembly by giving every senator N100 million. He gave every House of Representatives member N50 million; where did he get that money from?” Oshiomhole asked. “Mr President, in the name of Almighty God, you have a duty when you are re-elected to probe Obasanjo,” he said. Buhari on his part said the people of Borno and Yobe states were in a better position to assess whether there were improvements in the security sector or not. Addressing a mammoth crowd, the President Buhari assured the people that his re-election for a second term would provide him with the opportunity to build on his previous achievements. Thousands of people from all the 17 local government areas of the state thronged to Damaturu for the rally which was peaceful. In his remarks, Governor Ibrahim Gaidam assured the president that the state would be delivered to the APC.
