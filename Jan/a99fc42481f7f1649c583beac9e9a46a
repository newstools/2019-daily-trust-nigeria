The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has said his party will do all it takes to prohibit the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) from rigging the February 2019 presidential election. Speaking yesterday at his campaign rally in Jos, he said the APC has already settled to rig and that was why they are not campaigning across the country as the PDP was doing. He said the PDP will resolve all the violence and crises in Plateau State if elected and urged the electorate elect its gubernatorial candidate, Senator Jeremiah T. Useni. APC, according to Atiku, has created mass unemployment due to its unfavourable economic policies, and that the PDP will rectify all the havoc the APC has caused and provide thousands of jobs if elected. In his remarks, the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, said the APC has already resulted to intimidation with the clampdown of the National Assembly stressing that the ordeal of Senator Dino Melaye was one of the attempts to silence them. Speaking also, the PDP National Chairman, Uche Secondus, said they wonâ€™t tolerate violence in the forthcoming elections.
