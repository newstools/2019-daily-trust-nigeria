Governor Nasir el-Rufai, yesterday, disclosed that he had met with security chiefs in Abuja in order to ensure peaceful elections in Kaduna State. The governor had last week said he had, through recent intelligence reports, established that there were plans by elements of the opposition party to disrupt elections in the state. He said, yesterday, in addition to that, there were indications that some people wanted to foment crisis in Southern Kaduna before or during the elections and that the planners wanted the violence to spread to other parts of the state because they had sensed defeat in the coming general elections. “I have met with the Chief of Defence Staff (General Abayomi Olanisakin); the Chief of Army Staff (Lt-General Tukur Buratai) and the Inspector General of Police (Mohammed Abubakar Adamu) on the issue and they promised to strengthen security in Kaduna State before and during elections,” the governor said. He said the security chiefs had assured him that they would deploy new personnel to tackle the security threat and advised parents to warn their children to be of good behaviour, adding that they should not carry weapons on election day. El-Rufai also said he had met with traditional rulers of Southern Kaduna to reiterate the warning and enjoined the people of the state to come out and vote for their preferred candidates as adequate security would be provided on election day. He said, “But there are some people who bring ethnicity and religion on the issue. In spite of what the government has done for the people of Southern Kaduna, they have vowed not to vote for us because they say that our party is out to Islamise Nigeria.” The governor pointed out that Architect Barnabas Bala Bantex had been his deputy for close to four years but he had not Islamised him.
