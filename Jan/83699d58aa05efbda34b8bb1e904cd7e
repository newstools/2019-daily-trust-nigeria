A member of the Board of Trustees of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, has said that the doors of the party were still open to former members of the party who defected to other parties. Iwuanyanwu said that, as father of all the other political parties in Nigeria, PDP would be willing to forgive them as the prodigal son and accept them back into its fold. Iwuanyanwu, who spoke at the inauguration of the Campaign Council of Imo PDP governorship election in Owerri on Thursday, said that, as a party with a large heart, PDP will be willing to accept repentant former members of the party who still shared in its vision of a progressive and purposeful Nigeria. He said that what the party needed at this critical period was reconciliation, urging the party’s governorship candidate, Hon. Emeka Ihedioha, to pursue the agenda with all vigour. Also speaking, the State Chairman of the party, Barrister Charles Ezekwem, expressed optimism that the party will win the 2019 governorship election in the state. He urged members of the Campaign Council to work assiduously to ensure a total victory for PDP.
