The Senate yesterday confirmed Modibbo Hamman Tukur as the Director of the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU). The confirmation followed the adoption of the report of the committee on anti-corruption and financial crimes headed by Senator Chukwuka Utazi (PDP, Enugu). President Muhammadu Buhari had in a letter last week requested the Senate to confirm Tukur to head the unit. Daily Trust reports that Tukur is the first director of the NFIU as the unit was given independence through legislation by the National Assembly last year. Briefing his colleagues before the confirmation, Utazi said the nominee appeared before the committee on January 17 at about 4.pm and was told of his ‎requirements. He said the nominee responded to the committee’s questions accordingly and that there was no adverse report against the nominee, adding that Tukur possesses the requisite qualifications, experience and suitability for the position. Contributing, ‎Sen Jibrin Barau (APC, Kano) said since the nominee was able to answer the questions put to him by the committee, he should be confirmed without delay. On his part, Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu advised ‎the nominee to be professional and upright in carrying out his duties, noting that he must be fair to all Nigerians and not allow himself to be influenced by anybody. After the confirmation, Senate President Bukola Saraki congratulated Tukur on his appointment and subsequent confirmation, urging him to be above board in his job.
