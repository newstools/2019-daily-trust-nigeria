Policemen attached to the Alakuko police station in Lagos State have arrested six armed robbery suspects alleged to be involved in attacks on motorists on the Alakuko-Sango road. The arrest of the suspects arose from a piece of information the policemen received on Wednesday that some hoodlums, armed with dangerous weapons, were dispossessing motorists of their valuables in the Ajegunle area of the Alakuko-Sango road. The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Chike Oti, said that working on the information, operatives from the Alakuko police station mobilised to the scene. Oti said that on sighting the policemen, the armed robbery suspects fled. The policemen, however, chased them, leading to the arrest of Opeyemi Suraju, 22; Abdullahi Hammed, 18; Abiodun Adegoke, 20; Samuel Innocent, 25; Basit Makinde, 20; and Motunrayo Akeem, 23. The police spokesman said exhibits recovered from the suspects included cutlasses and daggers. He said that the suspects had confessed they committed the crime. Oti said that similarly, the police caught one Faruba Idris, 38, in the Ejigbo area of Lagos State robbing motorists. According to him, when the suspect was searched, a cut-to-size locally made gun and two cartridges were recovered from him. “He will be charged to court at the conclusion of investigation,” he said.
