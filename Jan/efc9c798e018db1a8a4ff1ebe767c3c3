The national chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Uche Secondus, has warned the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) against any attempt to rig the 2019 elections, saying the electorate have made up their minds to support the party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. Secondus, handed the warning during the PDP presidential campaign in Dutse in Jigawa state on Monday. He argued that the turning up of the party’s supporters enmasse indicated the acceptability of their candidates across the country. He urged the people of Jigawa state to vote all the PDP candidates for a purposeful change adding that if Abubakar get their mandate, he would make Nigeria work again. “The crowd is overwhelming in all the venues for our campaign and Jigawa state is not an exception. It is based on this that we are warning INEC against any attempt to manipulate this year’s election.” In his remark, Atiku promised to undertake three projects for the people of Jigawa state if voted into power. The projects, which include the dredging of River Hadejia and construction of two roads, that he promised to undertake were requested by the former governor of the state, Sule Lamido, during the rally.
