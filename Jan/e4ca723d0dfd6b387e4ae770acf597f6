An angry mob attacked the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) post at Giri, a major intersection on the Abuja-Lokoja highway, and set fire to their ambulance. A member of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), identified as Segun, said the incident happened around 8:30pm on Sunday after the angry mob laid siege on the FRSC post for allegedly failing to respond to a distress call at an accident scene where four persons died. Segun said some sympathisers rushed to the crash scene that involved a trailer and an unmarked vehicle near the Giri NNPC mega filling station near the overhead bridge. “I learnt it was the poor response of the FRSC men to the accident scene that provoked the  mob,” he said. He further said the four corpses and others that sustained injuries were later taken to the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital (UATH) in Gwagwalada. Our reporter learnt that the incident forced some traders selling by the road to flee from the area as the mob hurled stones on the FRSC office. Our reporter who stopped over at the FRSC post at 8:23am yesterday saw the burnt ambulance, while some  FRSC officers in mufti stood in the ashes  in front of their office discussing the incident. Effort to get comments from one of the FRSC officials were abortive. The Gwagwalada Unit Commander of the FRSC. ACC Moses Attah, could not be reached too as his phone was switched off. When contacted, the FCT Sector Commander of the FRSC, Wobin Gora, said he was still waiting to get details of the incident from the FRSC unit commander in Gwagwalada.
