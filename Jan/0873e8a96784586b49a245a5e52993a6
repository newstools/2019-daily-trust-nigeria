Dangote Oil Refining Company (DORC) Limited says it has taken delivery of one of the major components of its refinery equipment; the regenerator for the Residual Fluid Catalytic cracker. Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) is one of the most important conversion processes used in petroleum refineries <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery>. It is widely used to convert the high-boiling, high-molecular weight hydrocarbon <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon> fractions of petroleum <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum> crude oils <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crude_oil> into more valuable gasoline <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline>, olefinic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olefin> gases and other products. Dangote, in a statement, said the company has commenced the installation of equipment for the 650,000 barrels-per-day crude oil refinery being built in the Lekki area of Lagos. The refinery has continued to receive heavy equipment, through the Dangote jetty, located close to the refinery in the Lekki Free Trade Zone. It would be recalled that the jetty, constructed by Dangote Oil Refinery received its first 132 metres long, 9,755 tonnes general cargo ship, last year to deliver essential equipment for the ongoing construction. The refinery is being designed to accommodate multiple grades of domestic and foreign crude and process same into high-quality gasoline, diesel, kerosene and aviation fuel that meet Euro V emissions specifications, plus polypropylene. It will include a crude distillation unit, single-train residual fluid catalytic cracking unit, diesel hydro-treating unit, continuous catalyst regeneration unit, alkylation unit, and a polypropylene unit. The refinery will also be able to adjust its production of different products to match market demands. The Head of Quality Assurance/Quality Compliance and Construction, DORC, Mr. Rama Putta, said the sand filling of the site has been completed, adding that 60 per cent of the land was swampy. Executive Director, Dangote Group, Mr. Devakumar Edwin, said the 650,000 barrel per day refinery would stimulate economic development in Nigeria. He said the refinery was designed to process a variety of light and medium grades of crude and produce extremely clean fuels that meet Euro V specification. Fixing Nigeria’s refineries: How feasible?
