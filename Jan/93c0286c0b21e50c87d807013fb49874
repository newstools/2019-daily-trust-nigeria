President Muhammadu Buhari has called for respect for constitutional provisions in the oil-rich west-central African nation of Gabon. This follows the attempted military takeover in the country yesterday. According to the Nigerian leader, “The military officers in Gabon should understand that the era of military coups and governments in Africa and indeed worldwide, is long gone. “Democracy is supreme and the constitutional stipulations on the peaceful change of administration must be respected. That is the only way we can ensure peace and stability not only within the country but also in the region.” President Buhari, who is also the ECOWAS Chairman, urged military officers with political ambitions to resign or face their constitutional role. The President, in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity , Garba Shehu, enjoined the people of Gabon to remain on the side of peace, security, stability and democracy in their country.
