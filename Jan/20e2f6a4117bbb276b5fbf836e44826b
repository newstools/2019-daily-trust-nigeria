Plateau State Governor Simon Bako Lalong said, yesterday, that APC in the state will set up elections monitoring committees to monitor individuals who may want to venture into anti-party activities ahead of the general elections. Lalong stated this, yesterday, shortly before inaugurating members of his campaign council. He said, “We will not publish the names of those in the committee because you should not know those who would be investigating you,” he said. He chided former governor of the state and senator representing Plateau North, Jonah David Jang, who recently said he did not build the new government house at Little Rayfield for the present governor to occupy. The governor said, “I heard that someone said he will take away the keys of the house I’m occupying but he has forgotten that at the time he was occupying the house, we took away the keys from him. Maybe he is dreaming that he still has the keys to the house so he is deceiving someone that he will give him the keys.” He said the general elections were about the future of Plateau, adding that “the people at the grassroots should be made to understand that those who are responsible for their present poverty woes, who destroyed the education of their children yesterday and looted the national and state treasuries yesterday, are the same people seeking to replace APC and return to power.” Why states are yet to  name commissioners Makurdi is dirtiest state capital in Nigeria- Sen.
