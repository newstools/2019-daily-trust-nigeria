The Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) has congratulated Mr. Mohammed Abubakar Adamu on his appointment as the acting Inspector General of the Nigeria Police Force. “I am absolutely sure that Adamu Mohammed Lafia would bring professionalism and true leadership to policing in our country,” the Director General of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum, Mr. Asishana B Okauru was quoted as saying in a statement. The statement signed by Abdulrazaque Bello-Barkindo, the Head, Media and Public Affairs of the NGF Secretariat, said Adamu’s appointment is well deserved considering his accomplishments. Okauru, who had worked with several notable police officers during his time as the Director of the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) within the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), added that “I can attest to his solid pedigree and rich experience. He is arguably the most qualified serving police officer at this time, to occupy the very sensitive office of the Inspector General of Police”. The NGF prayed that the new top cop would harness all experiences from his previous offices, at home and abroad, to curb crime, ensure peace in the entire country and propound the policing principles that would lead Nigerians to believe that the police are their friends.
