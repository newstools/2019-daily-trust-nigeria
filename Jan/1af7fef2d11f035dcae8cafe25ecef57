The Kano State government has reacted to a court order seeking an accelerated hearing in a suit to compel the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC to arrest and prosecute wife of the governor of the state, Dr. Hafasat Abdullahi Ganduje. The state Commissioner of Information, Malam Muhammad Garba, in a statement he signed, claimed desperate politicians were bent on scampering the gubernatorial candidature of Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje in the forthcoming election. Garba expressed surprise at the timing of the release of the court order, saying it was dished out to embarrass Dr. Hafsat. He insisted that the order was a fabrication and does not exist. He said, “the plaintiff in the suit, the Incorporated Trustees of Hope Development and Empowerment, filed the case in November 2018 and December 10 was fixed for mention but were neither in the court nor were their representatives, only for them to release the purported court order at this material time.” Kwankwaso’s aides to sue Kano govt over entitlements Kwankwaso, Ganduje factions disagree on peace terms Ganduje threatens Kwankwaso with probe
