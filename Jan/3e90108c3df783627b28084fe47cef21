Mrs Abubakar, who spoke with newsmen in Abeokuta on the sidelines of a dinner organised in her honour by one of the contenders for PDP governorship ticket in Ogun State, Hon Oladipopu Adebutu. “Nigeria is in trouble”, she said, “there is need to vote out Buhari-led government on February 16 to get the country working again.” She said: “I am here in Ogun State to bring message of hope, love and togetherness that my husband has sent me to come and give people of Ogun State. “I have gone round and seen so many of our children on the streets. Anywhere I go, I see our boys, they are very idle. They have no jobs. They have no food. They will even tell you that they are hungry and that you should give them food. “There is no money. People are suffering. And we are now more divided than we were before. So, we want to unite this country. Before we do this, our PVCs must speak for us. By this time next month, we have to vote APC out.” Buhari can’t fix Nigeria — Titi Abubakar Titi Abubakar: How I met my husband, Atiku Atiku’s wife Titi replies critics, says 'I married Atiku because of his integrity'
