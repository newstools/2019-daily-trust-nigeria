The  National Youth Service Corps yesterday  said no corps member would be posted to volatile local government areas of Kaduna State as INEC adhoc staff for the forthcoming general elections. Addressing journalists in Kaduna, ‎NYSC Coordinator in the state, Hajiya Walida Siddique, noted that for a long,  corps members had not been deployed to  Kajuru and Birnin Gwari Local Government Areas of the state owing to insecurity. She said the corps was working with the Department of State Security Service to identify other volatile  areas in the state. “Most of our corps members are not from Kaduna and so, they don’t know the terrain much. What I’m saying in essence is that, they don’t know the terrain and when there is any unrest, they may decide to run and run into another problem, she said. According to her, it is not compulsory for corps members to participate in the election. She said the NYSC was not compelling any corps members to serve as ad-hoc staff.
