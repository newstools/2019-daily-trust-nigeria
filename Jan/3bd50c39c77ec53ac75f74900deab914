The Buhari Diaspora Support Organisation (BDSO) has said that President Muhammadu Buhari and the ruling APC have restored the hope and confidence of Nigeria’s friends abroad through the consistent fight against corruption. The chairman/global coordinator of the group, Mr. Charles Sylvester, in a chat with our correspondent, said “President Muhammadu Buhari has no doubt restored the fading hopes of many Nigerians who were subjected to institutional corruption, looting of our common wealth and impoverishment.” He said a lot of effort had been made to create an enabling environment for the socio-economic and political development of Nigeria through the restoration of values and confidence in the citizenry. “It is in recognition of this advancement by the Buhari/Osinbajo government that the Buhari Diaspora Organisation is calling on all Nigerians to support and vote President Muhammadu Buhari for continuity and stability of our great country,” he added.
