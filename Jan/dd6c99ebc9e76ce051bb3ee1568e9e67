Nigerians in Diaspora under the aegis of Buhari Diaspora Support Organization (BDSO) have asked former President Olusegun Obasanjo not to constitute a clog in the wheel of progress of the present administration. The group criticised “Former President Olusegun Obasanjo’s boisterous aggression towards President Muhammad Buhari.” According to the Global Coordinator of the group, Mr. Charles Efe Sylvester, the group said: “The Former President’s letter writing rascality is unbecoming and has ridiculed the exalted position of former president. He said Obasanjo was envious of Buhari’s record. A statement he personally signed said: “His public excoriation showed that he lacked the qualities befitting the status of a Former President, such as self respect, decorum, discipline and restraint. “The misdeeds of his rotten past must be exhumed for the world to see how dirty and unenviable his records are. He does not have the credibility to preach about democratic values or fight against corruption. “Obasanjo was the only President that disobeyed the judgement of the court on Lagos state allocation and now claims to be fighting for the judiciary. “He illegally impeached some governors during his tenure. He is an utter disgrace and should be investigated by the EFCC and all agencies on funds spent on the electricity.” APC has restored hope to Nigerians - Buhari support group Stop attacking Buhari, women warn Obasanjo Obasanjo, Atiku will lose together – Presidency
