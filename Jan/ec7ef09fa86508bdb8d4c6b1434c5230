A former Senate Minority Leader, Senator Godswill Akpabio, during the weekend in Ibadan said the opposition parties could say whatever they wished on the forthcoming general elections, but he was convinced beyond doubt that President Muhammadu Buhari will win the February 16 presidential election. Akpabio, who is also the national coordinator of the Presidential Support Committee (PSC) of the APC, said he was going to ensure he delivered 10 million votes for President Buhari. The former governor of Akwa Ibom, who spoke at the inauguration of the South West states’ coordinators of the committee held at Premier Hotel, Ibadan, said God had guaranteed victory for the APC presidential candidate and his vice, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, in the election. He said the group, at various local and state government levels across the country, had continued to ramp up support for the re-election of the APC presidential candidate, based on his achievements in the last three and half years.
