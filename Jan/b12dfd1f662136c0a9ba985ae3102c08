President Trump has called US intelligence agencies “naive” on Iran and also dismissed their assessment of the threat posed by North Korea. “Be careful of Iran. Perhaps Intelligence should go back to school!” Mr Trump tweeted. The testy response came after a US intelligence report said Iran was not making nuclear weapons. It also said that North Korea remained “unlikely to give up” its weapons stockpiles and production abilities. National intelligence director Dan Coats and other intelligence chiefs presented the Worldwide Threat Assessment report to the Senate on Tuesday. The US intelligence report also warned that cyber threats from China and Russia were a growing concern, and both countries may be seeking to influence the 2020 US presidential elections. In a series of tweets, Mr Trump said US intelligence officials “seem to be extremely passive and naive when it comes to the dangers of Iran. They are wrong!”  72nd UNGA: Threats, counter-threats and caution UNITED STATES: US hopeful Trump-Kim meet will go ahead Why North Korea is angered by ‘Libya model’ in nuclear talks
