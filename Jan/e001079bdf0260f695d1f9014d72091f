US Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren has announced that she is establishing an exploratory committee to consider a presidential run in 2020. The move, the first by a high-profile Democrat for 2020, allows Ms Warren, 69, to ramp up her fundraising. In October, Ms Warren revealed the results of a DNA test she said proved her Native American heritage after she was taunted by President Donald Trump. It immediately sparked speculation that she would run for the presidency. In a video address posted on social media on Monday, the progressive Massachusetts senator outlined her vision for a United States that she said would offer opportunities to all Americans. “Every person in America should be able to work hard, play by the same set of rules, and take care of themselves and the people they love,” she said. “That’s what I’m fighting for, and that’s why I’m launching an exploratory committee for president. I need you with me.”
