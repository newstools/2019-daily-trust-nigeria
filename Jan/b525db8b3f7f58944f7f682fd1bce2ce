Rescuers have pulled an infant boy alive from the rubble of an apartment building, some 35 hours after a collapse that has killed at least seven people and left dozens missing. They found the baby on Tuesday after hearing cries amid the debris. A section of the 10-storey building in Magnitogorsk, Russia collapsed on Monday following an explosion believed to have been triggered by a natural gas leak. The baby, who officials initially said was a girl, was seriously injured and his recovery prospects were unclear. The boyâ€™s mother survived the collapse and went to a local hospital to identify him.
