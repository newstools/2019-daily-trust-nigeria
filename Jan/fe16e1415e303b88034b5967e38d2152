The National Chairman of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Dr. Victor Ike Oye, has said this year will bring in abundance wealth and health for all Nigerians. In his New Year message released in Abuja, Dr. Oye predicted that 2019 would be better than 2018 in many aspects, especially in the general welfare of Nigerians. According to him, his optimism was based on the fact that God who Nigerians served was a merciful and gracious God that would not allow his people to suffer unduly. He was quoted in the statement by the party’s National Director of Publicity, Ifeanacho Oguejiofor, as expressing hope that some of the fiscal measures introduced by the Federal Government in the outgoing year would begin to bear fruit. “2018 was a very excruciating year for many Nigerians; I urge those that went through one sad experience or another to continue to look at the bright side of life, because no condition in life is permanent,” he said. He urged INEC not to dash the hopes of Nigerians in the electoral process by ensuring that the 2019 general elections are free and fair. 2019‘ll be better for Nigerians – APGA APGA felicitates with Buhari @75 2019: APGA finally gets presidential aspirant
