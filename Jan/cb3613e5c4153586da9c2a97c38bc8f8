The PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, has described the ruling APC as a sinking boat out to destroy Nigeria. He therefore called on the people of the South East zone to vote out the party for the good of Nigerians and generations yet unborn. Speaking, yesterday, at the South East zonal presidential rally held at Dan Anyiam Stadium, Owerri, Atiku alleged that APC was planning to rig the 2019 elections, and advised the electorate  that the only way to stop it was for them to protect their votes. “We are going to take over the state (Imo) in the next election. Immediately after you cast your vote, stay there and protect your vote,” he said. “APC is planning to rig the election. Please protect your vote. We have promised to restructure this country. APC is an evil party. They have turned this country as headquarters of poverty,” he added. The vice presidential candidate, Peter Obi, said the “South East will follow Atiku; he is the one to develop Igboland. He has promised us restructuring; he will revamp the economy of Nigeria.” Senate President Bukola Saraki, said he was happy to be part of the revolution in the entire South East zone.
