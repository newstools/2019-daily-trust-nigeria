Governor Mohammed Abdullahi Abubakar has called on people of Bauchi state to vote for the All Progressives Congress (APC) at all levels in the forthcoming 2019 general elections. He made the call over the weekend while speaking at the APC statewide campaign rally in Dambam, in Bauchi Central Senatorial District. He said that voting for APC candidates will help President Muhammadu Buhari to complete and execute socio-economic policies and projects he initiated since coming into power in 2015. He urged the electorates to ensure that they vote for the party’s National Assembly candidates who will help the president implement his policies through sound and positive legislations that will put Nigeria on the right track. According to him, wrong people voted into the national assembly sabotaged and slowed down president Buhari’s positive economic and change agenda policies and programmes. “We thank the almighty Allah that those bad eggs in our Party have eased themselves out because they have realized that it will never be business as usual in the APC. “This gives us the opportunity to present the right caliber of representatives that will help President Muhammadu Buhari in executing such policies and programmes that the majority of Nigerians having been yearning since the return of democratic rule,” the governor said.
