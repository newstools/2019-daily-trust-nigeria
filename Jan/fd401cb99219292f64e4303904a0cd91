The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) says the suspension of the erstwhile Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Walter Onnoghen had devastated the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. The APC said PDP’s plans to get back to power through the “cash and carry” justice system they put in place during their 16 years reign was in serious jeopardy. The APC National Publicity Secretary, Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, in a statement issued on Monday, said Nigerians had been inundated with reports regarding self-confessed discrepancies in the asset declaration made by erstwhile Chief Justice of Nigeria in recent weeks. Issa-Onilu, who wondered why the PDP and its presidential candidate Alhaji Atiku Abubakar was opposed to Onnoghen’s suspension as CJN, said President Muhammadu Buhari, on Friday, took the decisive action of suspending him acting on an order of the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT). He said the strident opposition to Justice Onnoghen’s suspension, coming from the opposition PDP led by its presidential candidate, again pointed to their penchant for anything corrupt and criminal. He told the PDP and Atiku that Justice Onnoghen was not entitled to special treatment, stressing that such entitlement being canvassed by the PDP and Atiku was alien to the laws and not in tandem with the APC cardinal objective of fighting against corruption and overall Change Agenda. “In the spirit of good conscience, integrity, character and general conduct expected of occupants of public office, we are of the strong position that Justice Onnoghen should have resigned immediately to face his trial after his confession and spare the Judiciary further disrepute. “Justice Onnoghen did not. This in itself smells mischief. Justice Onnoghen fought to keep himself as CJN by all means possible, thereby fighting the same constitution that he swore to protect.”
