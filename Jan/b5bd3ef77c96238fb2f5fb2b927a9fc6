Controversy has continued to trail the alleged arrest and subsequent remand of one Yinka Badmus a photojournalist by policemen attached to the Anti-Cultism unit of the Lagos State Command. While Yinka had alleged that he was arrested because of his hair style, the Lagos State Command insisted that he belonged to a secret Cult gang, the Eiye confraternity. Yinka was remanded in Ikoyi prison on the orders of an Ogudu Chief Magistrates court, Lagos. The State Police Public Relations Officer, Chike Oti, clarified that Yinka could not have been charged to court for wearing deadlocks, saying the command only charges suspects based on existing laws and not mundane reasons. He said, “To start with, it is ridiculous to say that the Anti-Cultism Unit of the Lagos State Police Command charged a suspect to court because of his hairstyle. Clearly speaking, Yinka Badmus and 13 others were charged to Ogudu Magistrate Court on January 4, 2019, on two-count charges. “The first count is conspiracy i.e for conspiring amongst themselves to commit felony to wit membership of unlawful society contrary to and punishable under Section 411, Cap CH, C17, Vol. 3 Laws of Lagos, 2015. The second count holds them for belonging to an unlawful society known as Eiye confraternity contrary to and punishable under Section 42(a), Cap CH, C17  Vol. 3, Laws of Lagos State 2015. “The suspects were however granted bail In the sum of fifty thousand Naira (N50,000) by a court of competent jurisdiction. However, those who could not meet the bail conditions were remanded in prison custody pending when they would meet the stipulated conditions for their bail. This is an issue that is neither within the purview of Force nor its control”.
