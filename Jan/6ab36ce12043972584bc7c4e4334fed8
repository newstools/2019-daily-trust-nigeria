Leader of the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) and South South Forum, Chief Edwin Clark has expressed shock over the planned arraignment of the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen, over assets declaration. He said the move was shocking as the CJN was doing his job diligently. He told Daily Trust on Sunday yesterday that the forum will resist any form of harassment of the CJN. Speaking with our reporter on telephone Saturday night, Clark said, “The news of the arraignment of The Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen, before the Code of Conduct tribunal (CCT) on Monday has come to us as a shock because there is nothing to show that this man has not been doing his job properly. “There is nothing to show that he is corrupt; simply because they want to rig this election, they want to remove him to put somebody who will do their bidding after the election otherwise there is no basis for harassing the judiciary,” he noted. Chief Clark said “Yesterday, it was the Acting Director General of the Department of State Security Services (DSS), Mathew Seyeifa, who was removed and somebody who was retired was appointed to take his place.” Re-echoing the Niger Delta regions stand to resist the arraignment of Justice Onnoghen, the former Federal Minister of Information and Senator of the Second Republic of Nigeria, said: “We deserve some respect. So we will resist this one, and I understand that our governors had a meeting on this matter too and we will all come together.” CCT: Edwin Clark kicks over planned arraignment of CJN CCT: Non-declaration of asset a mistake, funds are from my estacodes - CJN Onnoghen CUPP condemns trial of CJN, alleges APC plans to manipulate 2019 elections
