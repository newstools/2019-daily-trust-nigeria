An Ogba chief magistrate court yesterday ordered the remand in prison custody of an armed robbery suspect for allegedly chopping off his victim’s two hands with a machete. The accused, Jimoh Azeez, 27, was arraigned for causing grievous harm to Yusuf Bamidele during an armed robbery operation. The prosecutor, Superintendent E. Ayorinde, told the court that Azeez, along with three other persons still at large, attacked Bamidele with a cutlass when they raided his Balogun Street residence in the Oshodi area of Lagos. “The accused attacked the victim with a cutlass for daring to resist them. The defendant and his accomplices also robbed one Sunday Sonuga of the sum of N460,000 but left him unhurt whereas Bamidele lost his hands to them because he had no money,” Ayorinde said, adding that while the police were able to arrest the accused a few hours after the attack, his accomplices bolted away. The magistrate, Mrs B.O. Osunsanmi, denied the accused bail and ordered that he should be remanded in prison custody. The court directed the prosecutor to send the file to the Director of Police Prosecution for advice and adjourned the case till February 20, 2019.
