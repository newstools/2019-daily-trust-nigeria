The Director General of Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), Mr. Alex A. Okoh, has tasked Ocean & Cargo Terminal Services Limited, the concessionaire of Terminal ‘B’ Warri Old Port to focus on increased efficiency, improved service delivery and  reduction in the cost of shipping and clearing of goods. A statement by spokesperson for the BPE, Amina Tukur Othman, said the signing ceremony for the concession of the port between the concessionaire and the bureau was witnessed by critical stakeholders, including the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) in Abuja yesterday. Okoh reminded Ocean &  Cargo Terminal Services Ltd that the pursuit of its business objectives must be tailored in a way that would assist in the realisation of the objectives of the port concession programme of the Federal Government which commenced in 2005 and culminated in the concession of over 23 terminals to private operators. He recalled that the Federal Government upgraded the facilities at Terminal ‘B’ Warri Old Port, which included the construction of a new quay wall and apron equipped with requisite facilities for berthing vessels, making it one of the most modern port terminals in the country at the time. “Upon completion of the rehabilitation and reconstruction works, there was need to concession the terminal to a private operator that would be responsible for the operation of the terminal and carrying out further development of its facilities in line with the Ports Concession Programme”, Okoh said. He added that following the approval by the NCP, advertisements inviting Expressions of Interest (EOIs) from prospective concessionaires for the concession of the terminal were carried out  by the bureau.
