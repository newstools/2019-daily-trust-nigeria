The Peoples Democratic Party Presidential Campaign Organisation (PDP-PCO) has said the All Progressives Congress (APC) is losing grounds under the leadership of its current National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole. The Director Media and Publicity of the PPCO, Kola Ologbondiyan, said in a statement on Wednesday that since Oshiomhole came into office, the APC has been losing ground across the country for which it has resorted to renting crowd for its presidential campaign rallies. Ologbondiyan explained that the “rented crowd” was to create a false impression that President Buhari, “who has been rejected by Nigerians” still commands followership in the country. “It has been established that over 50 percent of people at any President Buhari’s state rallies are made up of apolitical persons rented from contiguous states. “This explains why the crowd at President Buhari’s rallies, which having no affinity with his ambition, is always unruly and do not respond to the APC slogans or wave the APC brooms. “We know how the Buhari Presidency has sunk low to be paying money to people to attend his rallies; how the Presidency and the APC are recruiting agents in various parts of the country, through whom they conduit renting fees ranging from N5,000 to N10,000 per head, at President Buhari’s rally, which is now the latest racket in town,” the PPCO said. 2019 polls: APC campaign flag off mockery of Buhari – PDP APC, PDP test strength in Buhari’s base tomorrow 2015 ELECTIONS INTRIGUES jonathan plots to    cripple buhari’s    campaign - apc
