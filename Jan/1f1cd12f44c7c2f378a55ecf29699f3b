The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has described as false the alarm on the threat of a bomb on Air Peace flight from Abuja to Lagos Wednesday morning. A statement from Mrs. Henrietta Yakubu, the General Manager, Corporate Affairs said the “passenger that raised the alarm is said to have a history of mental illness and is currently with the security agencies and medical experts for assessment.” It said “following the false information, officers of FAAN’s aviation security swiftly evacuated passengers, crew and cargo on board the flight and a bomb squad immediately conducted a thorough check on the aircraft and baggage, which confirmed the information to be false.” It said after the search exercise a “fresh boarding call was made and passengers boarded the flight to the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos.” “The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria will like to re-assure passengers and all airport users that our airports are safe and secure. They should carry on their lawful activities without any fear,” it noted.
