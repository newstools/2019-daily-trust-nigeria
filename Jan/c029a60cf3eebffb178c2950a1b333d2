The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) on Tuesday commended the House of Representatives for adopting N30, 000 as the new National Minimum Wage and the quick passage of the bill. Mr Ayuba Wabba, NLC President gave the commendation in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), in Abuja, while reacting to the passage of the National Minimum Wage bill by the House of Representatives. Wabba said the passage confirms the wishes of the people. “We also plead with the Senate to follow the same path, so that it can be assented to and workers could begin to benefit from it. “I want to say that in this battle for the new national minimum wage, all of us are winners, nobody is a loser because really the centrality is what matter most,” he said. Also, Dr Peter Ozo-Eson, NLC General Secretary, said the lawmakers had done what the Nigerian people expect from them. He commended the House of Representatives and also urged the Senate to quickly do the needful.
