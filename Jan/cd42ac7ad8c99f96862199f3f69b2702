The Buhari Campaign Organisation (BCO) has threatened to seek legal redress against the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, if within the next seven days they fail to provide proof that President Muhammadu Buhari and members of his family own substantial shares in Etisalat Nigeria and Keystone Bank. Atiku had in a statement signed  by his Special Assistant on Public Communication, Phrank Shaibu, claimed that Buhari and his family had acquired shares in Keystone Bank with total assets of $1.916 billion (equivalent to N307.5 billion) as well as purchased about ₦3 billion worth of shares in the new Pakistani Islamic Bank. BCO in a statement signed by its Director of Communications and Strategic Planning, Malam Gidado Ibrahim, said “beyond mere politicking, the allegations made by Atiku and his party are too weighty to be ignored or considered as electioneering gimmicks.” Ibrahim said Atiku and PDP must provide evidence of the allegations of sleaze against Buhari and his family because the burden of proof always lay with the person who laid charges. “These are very weighty allegations and we are not saying the former vice president and his party have no right to blow the whistle, especially under an administration with a whistleblowing policy in place. But following the provisions of the law, the burden of proof (onu probandi) is always on the person who brings a claim or alleges. “We therefore urge Atiku and his party, PDP, to show proof that the president and members of his family have shares in these companies. At least with such evidence, they would have done great service to Nigerians by exposing corruption. “But if they fail to do so within seven days, BCO will be left with no other option than to drag them to court on behalf of President Buhari where they will be compelled by the law to provide evidence or pay damages,” the statement said.
