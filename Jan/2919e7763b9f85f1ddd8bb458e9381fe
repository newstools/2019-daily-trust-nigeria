He promised to give the state a refinery as requested by Governor Udom Emmanuel. “I have been coming to this state since 1998, every development that you have seen in this state has been the work of PDP. You will progress more if you continue to be PDP. Therefore, I commend the people of Akwa Ibom for remaining in the PDP,” he said.
