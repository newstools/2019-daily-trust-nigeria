The Esogba of Benin Kingdom, Chief (Dr) David Edebiri, says the suspension and arraignment of the Chief Judge of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen, is a boost to the anti-corruption fight of the federal government. The Esogba of Benin, in an interview with journalists in Benin on Saturday, commended President Muhammadu Buhari for his courage and political will to rid the nation of corruption. “The arrangement of the CJN before the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) is a major breakthrough in the fight against corruption. I congratulate the anti-corruption agencies and the federal government for their doggedness in the war against corruption,” he said. Edebiri wondered why some people are threatening to pull down the country with the suspension and arraignment of Justice Onnoghen and the appointment of acting CJN, noting that Chief Obafemi Awolowo and Dr. Nnamdi Azikwe were prominent figures who were arraigned in 1964 and 1953 respectively, saying heaven didn’t fall then. “I did not see the reason why people constitute themselves into seasonal fans. Awolowo was sentenced to 10 years and Action Group and Yoruba did not pull down the roof. This development will strengthen the anti-corruption fight,” he said. He called on Nigerians whom he said have constituted themselves into professional supporters club of corruptive tendencies to have a rethink as the wealth of this nation belongs to all of us and not the few threatening to pull down the roof of the house each time a member of the club is accused of any wrong doing. “I am 100 percent in support of President Muhammadu Buhari’s action. I urged him to go on with the campaign for his second term without distraction. This will enable him to complete his good work, particularly his anti-corruption crusade,” he said.
