Ikeja, the capital of Lagos State deserves a facelift to reduce the congestion and traffic jam that has characterized many parts of the state capital, it has been observed. Mutiu Okunola, a candidate for the House of Representatives for Ikeja Federal Constituency under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) observed that many roads in Ikeja have been last tarred for more than 20 years ago and are no longer motorable. He stated this on Saturday while embarking on a house-to-house campaign to solicit for votes ahead of the February 16 National Assembly election. City News reports that the rally took him round the hinterlands of Ikeja beginning from Ojodu where he interacted with locals who cried out over inadequate access roads, as well as lack of potable water supply. Okunola in a chat with our correspondent said though Ikeja is a cosmopolitan area and the seat of government, there is the need for adequate planning and infrastructural overhaul to give the communities around it the deserved facelift. For instance, he said there should be an overhead bridge from Omole linking Lagos-Ibadan expressway in order to reduce the daily traffic snarls at Agidingbi. He promised to if elected work towards changing the face of Ikeja and drive youth empowerment. He said, “We have to give Ikeja a facelift in terms of tarring of all the roads in the wards and constituencies in Ikeja. If you go to Ikeja, you find out that most of the roads were tarred in 15, 20 years. “They have not constructed new roads, no new bridges to link. Look at Omole Phase one to the Express road, they ought to have put an overhead bridge. Look at the one that Coca-Cola is bringing from Agidingbi, you can’t link Adeniyi Jones. We need to decongest Ikeja and we are supposed to have a light rail system”.
