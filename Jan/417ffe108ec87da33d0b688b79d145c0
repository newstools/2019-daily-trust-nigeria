President of Aviation Safety Roundtable Initiative (ART), Elder Gbenga Olowo, has rated the performance of the Federal Government in the aviation sector, concluding that 2018 witnessed modest efforts by government, its agencies and practicing stakeholders. However, ART, an aviation think-tank group, noted that since 2014 aviation business outcome in Nigeria had been on the decline year on year (YOY). This, according to ART was basically due to economic recession and yet to improve difficult environment of doing business despite effort of government to ease the process. Olowo blamed the challenge on bureaucrats and their different agenda especially hinged on security. In a New Year message, yesterday, Olowo said government efforts in sustaining an accident-free sector “should translate more into good results in 2019 in spite of being the election year faced with strong apprehension.” “Nevertheless, Nigerian aviation market remains strong and good for Investment.  Government at the centre should remain focused at stimulating private sector driven aviation sector during 2019,” he said. He said the plan to concession airports remains only a statement for four years, adding that action is required against existing airport government monopoly. The president noted that Lagos Airport deserves much more attention in terms of growth strategy, intermodal connectivity and top of the rank security and technology apparatus. “Lagos comes as a natural West African hub and currently generates 60/65% revenue, sustaining the remaining unviable Nigerian airports,” he added. He pointed out that the new international airport in Abuja delivered by government as Xmas Gift “must not be one of those common wealth wastes consequent upon poor/ lack of schedule maintenance”. “ACs, toilets, baggage conveyor belts, etc must function in 2028 as it is in 2018 when it was commissioned. Airport, airlines, airspace growth must grow simultaneously,” he added.
