A French court has authorized Central Africa Republic soccer executive and alleged militia leader Patrice-Edouard Ngaissona to be handed over to the Hague war crimes tribunal, a judicial source said on Monday. Ngaissona, who has been described by prosecutors as the “senior leader” of the anti-balaka militia that carried out systematic attacks on the Muslim population in 2013-2014, was arrested in France on Dec. 12.  The International Criminal Court (ICC) said Ngaissona is suspected of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Ngaissona has denied the charges.
