French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has said a no-deal Brexit looks “less and less unlikely” and has launched a contingency plan to prepare for it. After the UK Parliament rejected the withdrawal agreement, Mr Philippe said laws had to be passed and millions invested in French ports and airports. An EU official will now visit all 27 capitals to co-ordinate no-deal plans. EU countries with close UK ties have already begun preparing for its departure on 29 March without a deal. “We are taking this very seriously now as the possibility of a no-deal Brexit is becoming more possible after Tuesday night,” said European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas. “This is work which is ongoing and it’s developing fully. We are not taking any chances.” Germany’s Economy Minister, Peter Altmeier, has warned “everyone in Europe would lose” from the UK leaving without an agreement. 40 UK lawmakers willing to vote down Brexit deal Tony Blair advises party to vote down May’s possible Brexit deal UK: It will be catastrophic to halt Brexit, May warns
