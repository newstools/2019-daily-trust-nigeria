The Social Democratic Party (SDP) candidate for Yewa South and Ipokia Federal Constituency in Ogun State, Olukayode Idowu, said all lawmakers who represented the constituency at the House of Representatives including the present occupant of the seat, Abdulkabir Akinlade  have failed the electorate in the area. Idowu expressed disappointment over deplorable infrastructure in the constituency, saying all the past legislators have not justified their elections. The Rep candidate who spoke at a Press Conference in Ilaro, Ogun State, said, “I am disappointed in all of them (past and present representatives). They have failed us. They have not done anything for the constituency. All our roads are bad, without good roads, no investors will come in and invest. “We need good roads and developmental projects to open our area to the world. The road we are enjoying today was constructed by Chief Olusegun Osoba. I don’t know why  Governor Ibikunle Amosun has not done anything in Yewa,” he said. Idowu said if elected, he would  lobby and fight as well as make sure the federal government presence was felt in the area in terms infrastructural development. He pledged to lobby the federal government to revamp the rail line in the area, said the rail line would help in stopping killings of the people on the roads by trailers.
