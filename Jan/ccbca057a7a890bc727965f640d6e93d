200 volunteers in Osun State have commenced a House-to-House campaign for the reelection of President Muhammad Buhari and all candidates of All Progressive Congress (APC) in the state. The volunteers are under the auspices of Dr Michael Olugbile House-to-House Independent Campaign Group (DMOH2HICG). The convener of DMOH2HICG, Dr Michael Olugbile (DMO) said the initiative was informed by his genuine desire for good governance at the federal and state levels for the benefit of the citizenry. Dr Olugbile, who was one of the aspirants for Odo-Otin/Ifelodun/Boripe Federal Constituency seat in the House of Representatives, said in spite his failiure to secure the ticket of the party, he remained committed to ensuring victory for all APC candidates in the general elections. “As part of my desire to see positive change in Nigeria, I have twice sought for the ticket of House of Reps under APC but God said it was not yet time, for the vision is for an appointed time. “Meanwhile, while we await the appointed time, we will actively support those nominated by our party for various positions to win their election,” he said. Daily Trust learnt that the volunteers would do House-to-House campaign for all APC candidates in Odo-Otin, Ifelodun and Boripe local government areas. “The goal is to ensure victory for our candidates from President Buhari to Dr Ajibola Basiru (SRJ) for Osun Central Senatorial district and Hon Afolabi Olalekan for Odo-Otin/Ifelodun/Boripe Federal Constituency seat in the House of Representatives,” he added.
