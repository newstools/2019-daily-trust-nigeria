National leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, yesterday debunked reports that he was rushed to the hospital after slumping. Speaking yesterday in Abuja when he received representatives of traditional rulers from the South West led by the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, Tinubu dismissed the reports  as “Fake news”, saying “Whoever is manufacturing it, you better not believe them.” Tinubu, who also spoke on the report over the absence of governors at the meeting of the presidential campaign council, dismissed the information as fake news. “The point is, the governors had to stay back because we all don’t have to converge in one place to decide certain modalities when we can easily go back to them on what was discussed and what we expect from your state. That is what we call structuring in an election,” Tinubu said.
