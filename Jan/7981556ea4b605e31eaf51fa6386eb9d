The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) will spend N2.6 billion on 30 roads in some  Abuja suburbs, Tanko Ishaku Yamawo, the  coordinator, Satellite Towns Development Agency, has said. He said the roads included the 11.7km road rehabilitation in Karu, explaining that 700 metres of the road project, from Karu Roundabout to Customs Junction had been completed and would be opened for public use before the end of the week. Speaking when he inspected the ongoing road project in Karu, yesterday, the coordinator said the entire road project would be completed and delivered to the end users before the middle of the year, if the budget was released early. Yamawo also advised other residents of the territory to exercise patience as the ongoing road work in Karu community would be replicated in other satellite towns in the FCT. Also speaking, the project manager, Engr Jamil Naser of Enerco Nig Ltd, noted that the only challenge facing the project at the moment was poor funding, adding that the project would be completed as soon as funds were made available. “We have been here for almost 12 months now, working on this site. We are doing our best to complete the work, with the hope that the government will make enough provision for us in the budget, enough to conclude this work before the end of the year,” the project manager urged.
