President Muhammadu Buhari will get 10 million votes in the six states that make up the North East geo-political zone, his campaign director for the zone, Senator Ali Ndume, said yesterday. Ndume stated this while speaking about today’s campaign rally of President Buhari in Borno and Yobe states. He said a mother of all rallies had been prepared for the president in the zone. “We are preparing for the mother of all rallies in the country. Our hope is to give the president at least 95 per cent of our votes, by God’s grace,” he said in a phone interview. Daily Trust reports that the North East has 11.2 million registered voters, representing 13.4 per cent of the total registered voters, according to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). In 2015, Buhari polled 15.4 million to defeat former President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan who polled 12.8 million votes. Ndume said the remaining five per cent of the votes would be shared between the presidential candidate of PDP, Atiku Abubakar and candidates of other political parties.
