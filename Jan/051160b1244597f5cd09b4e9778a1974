The Peoples Democratic Party in Benue State has faulted the endorsement of President Muhammadu Buhari’s candidacy by the umbrella body of herders in the country. State Publicity Secretary of PDP and Chairman, Publicity Sub-Committee of Benue PDP State Campaign Organisation for 2019 presidential election, Bemgba Iortyom, in a statement, made available to Daily Trust on Sunday in Makurdi faulted the group over the endorsement. “Miyetti Allah’s endorsement of Buhari’s candidacy is a clear statement which Nigerians must understand lucidly for what it truly is; that with Buhari as president, the bloodshed and carnage being wrecked on them by Fulani herdsmen is sure to continue. “Their declaration of war on Atiku’s candidacy on the other hand has only one interpretation; that even they know that with him as president their nefarious agenda and criminality which has so far gone unchecked under Buhari, will have no place in Nigeria,” he stated.
