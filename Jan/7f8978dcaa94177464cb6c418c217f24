Nasarawa state governor, Umaru Al-Makura, has assured the kingmakers and members of the ruling houses of Lafia – descendants of Dunama – that the choice of a successor for the late Emir would be done according to the laid down rules guiding the selection of the new Emir of Lafia. Speaking to newsmen following a closed door meeting between the governor, security chiefs in the state, government officials, kingmakers and the heirs to the Lafia emirate stool, the commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Mr. Haruna Iliya Osegba said “the meeting was to clear up the misunderstanding that circulated on the successor of the Late Emir. “Members of the royal houses were advised to ensure that the peace and sanctity of Lafia was not broken, as well as come together and support whoever emerges as the new Emir as they were of the same family and blood.” He stated that they would be fair to all, admonishing them to be law-abiding as Lafia has reached a status in the country and all of us must work hard to ensure that we move it higher continuing from where the late Emir left it. The commissioner describes the efforts of the late Emir in moving Lafia from the days of the Native Authority era to the present-day’s greater heights, calling on all that they have a duty to sustain the height that the Late Emir had carried Lafia, the Emirate and by extension the entire Nasarawa state. Osegba also called on all people to ensure the peace of the community and development of Nasarawa state. It will be recalled that some people posted on social media that one of the Princes contending for the throne of Emir of Lafia has been selected by the kingmakers which led youths to start jubilating in the palace, but the government later said it was a false news.
