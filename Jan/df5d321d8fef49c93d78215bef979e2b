Residents of Ekiti state especially members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Monday went wild in jubilation as the Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Abuja upheld the victory of Governor Kayode Fayemi. The APC members, armed with the party’s symbol of broom, danced round major streets and government office and ended their procession at the party’s secretariat in Ajilosun area of the state capital. The tribunal, in its judgement delivered by Justice Suleiman Belgore, said Fayemi was validly elected in the July 14, 2018 governorship election, contrary to the position of the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prof Kolapo Olusola. Daily Trust recalls that Fayemi had polled a total of 197,459 to defeat Olusola, who scored a total votes of 178, 022 to emerge a runner-up. The APC members, who started their jubilation from Odo Ado, a section of Ado Ekiti metropolis were led by a House of Representatives candidate in Ekiti Central federal constituency I, Hon. Sola Fatoba and Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Mobilisation, Hon. Tunji Ogunlola. Ogunlola, while addressing the crowd, said Fayemi worked very hard to win the election and that the judgement had confirmed the position of the party. They danced to the music being supplied by a popular musician in Ekiti and the long convoy of vehicles caused traffic logjam along Ado-Ikere-Akure road. The APC described the victory as expected, saying the party perpetrated no electoral fraud in the election to warrant the nullification of its outcome.
