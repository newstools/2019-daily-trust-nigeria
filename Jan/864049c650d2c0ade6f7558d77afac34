The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has restricted movement for trailers, tankers and other articulated vehicles into Lagos state on 1st, 2nd, 8th and 9th of February, 2019. The Lagos state Sector Commander, FRSC, Hyginus Omeje, said the decision was reached at the end of the meeting of heads of security and traffic management agencies in the state held on Tuesday January 29, 2019 at Lagos State Command of the Nigeria Police Force. Omeje said this is due to the 2019 Access Bank International Marathon scheduled to hold on 1st and 2nd, February, 2019. “As a result, the road will be busier than usual”, the statement said. “This decision is in the general interest of the motoring public and also targeted at ensuring free flow of traffic and forestall security breaches on the highways and other roads on the stated days”. Accordingly, a joint team of traffic and security agencies have been set up to ensure strict compliance with this directive adding that the affected motorists found wanting will be severely reprimanded.
