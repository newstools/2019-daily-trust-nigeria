Thirty-two governorship candidates including two women vying in next month’s election on the platform of different political parties in Benue State, yesterday, signed a peace pact. Our correspondent reports that the various candidates made verbal commitments after appending their signatures to ensure peace before, during and after the elections. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in the state, Nentawe Yilwatda, in his address before the formalities took place in Makurdi, urged the candidates to abide by the peace agreement signed. “We’re committing ourselves towards a peaceful election,” he said. Yilwatda, noted that the commission could not afford to suffer the magnitude of loss experienced during the 2015 election in the state, stressing that three INEC offices were burnt at that time alongside two staff, one of who eventually lost his life. He counselled that no single contestant was worth the life of anybody and that the lives of 2.4 million electorate should not be taken for granted.
