Sudanese authorities blocked access to popular social media platforms used to organize and broadcast nationwide anti-government protests triggered by an economic crisis, internet users said. Sudan has been rocked by near-daily demonstrations over the past two weeks. Users of the three main telecommunications operators in the country – Zain, MTN and Sudani – said access to Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp has only been possible through use of a virtual private network (VPN). Though VPNs can bring their own connection problems and some Sudanese are unaware of their existence, activists have used them widely to organize and document the demonstrations. NetBlocks, a digital rights NGO, said data it collected, including from thousands of Sudanese volunteers, provided evidence of “an extensive internet censorship regime”. Bader al-Kharafi, CEO of parent company Zain Group, told Reuters: “Some websites may be blocked for technical reasons beyond the company’s specialization.”
