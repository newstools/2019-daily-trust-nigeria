The House of Representatives, yesterday, mandated its Committee on Petroleum Resources (Upstream) to investigate alleged irregularities in the renewal of oil leases by the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR). Also joined in the probe is the Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources, which is being fingered in “illegal discount and rebates” as well as “massive loss of over US$10 billion to the government.” The resolution followed a motion on the “need to investigate alleged irregularities in the ongoing renewal of oil and gas leases and massive loss of revenue to Nigeria” by Chika Adamu (APC, Niger). Adamu, leading debate on the motion, expressed concern that the irregularities being perpetrated by the DPR and the petroleum ministry were capable of denying the Federal Government revenues to the tune of US$10 billion. The lawmaker further argued that by so doing, both government agencies had deliberately flouted subsisting legal framework for oil lease renewal. He added that both agencies had also refused to provide the House Committee on Petroleum Resources (Upstream) with relevant data on the ongoing renewal of leases.
