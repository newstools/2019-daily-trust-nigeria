Bauchi state is set to introduce hospitality tax and take other measures to improve its Internally Generated Revenues (IGR). The Chairman of Board of Internal Revenue Service (BIRS), Jibrin Hussaini Jibo, disclosed this while speaking to journalists on the 2019 budget revenue projection. Revenue projection for the 2019 Bauchi State budget was put at N15 billion. According to him, the Board decided to introduce the hospitality tax because the sector is booming in the state as most of activities for the North East are being conducted in the state. He, however, said that despite the booming of hospitality business and presence of contractors, the state gets almost nothing as the largest percentage of the revenue is being collected by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS). Jibo informed that measures taken by the Board like automation and the adoption of the Treasury Single Account (TSA) where all revenues go have improved the state revenue earnings over the years. The Board chairman informed that they realised over N40 million from General Motor Receipt and Motor Vehicle Licence Sales adding that N28 million was realised between June and December, 2018.
