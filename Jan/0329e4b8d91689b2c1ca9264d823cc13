The Ogun Central Youth Forum has endorsed the candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Titi Oseni-Gomez to defeat Governor Ibikunle Amosun who is the candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC) in the February 16 Ogun Central poll. The State Coordinator of the group, Kehinde sholola said they endorsed Oseni-Gomez because of her experience as a former lawmaker and “it is the turn of a female candidate to represent them.” Speaking on behalf of the group to journalists in Abeokuta, the state capital, Solola said Oseni-Gomez after leaving office still continues her humanitarian service within and outside her senatorial district. His words: ” We are not ashamed to pitch our tent with Her because she’s a good ambassador and we solely believe that she will perform above the people’s expectations”. “As a former Speaker, a member of House of Assembly, her antecedent speaks volume. Even after she left office, she continues her humanitarian service to her people. Our support is for her.” Ogun: Tejuoso loses out, as Amosun, Osoba's son, others make INEC list Edwin Clark's wife battles Amosun for Ogun Central senatorial seat Scramble for women’s votes boost chances of female deputy governors
