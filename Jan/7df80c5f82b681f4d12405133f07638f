The Zamfara State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), governorship candidate, Alhaji Bello Mohammed Matawalle has admonished the youths particularly his supporters not to engage in violence in the forthcoming elections. Matawalle gave the advice at his Gusau residence when members of the Correspondents Chapel of the Nigerian Union of Journalist’s ( NUJ), Zamfara Council  paid him a condolence visit to commiserate with him over the  death of his mother. He said the death of his mother has made him realised that despite political differences the people of the state loved one  another. The PDP governorship candidate said President Muhammadu Buhari called him personally to condole with him and also sent a delegation while governor Abdul’Aziz Yari Abubakar attended the burial of his late mother. “I will not forgive any  youth who goes on air to insult or physically attack any person or politician on my behalf because the people of the state and the other side have shown me that no matter our differences we have,  we are one in joy and sorrow”, he said. Mutawalle said the youths should know that they have a bright future and should not allow that future to be jeopardised by selfish politicians by allowing themselves to be used as elements for maiming or killings of innocent persons or destruction of  property. “No matter our political, religious or tribal differences, we are together, therefore, the youths should learn to live in peace and harmony and stop hating each other on behalf of the politicians”, he warned. 2015: Zamfara’s 5 against 1 Zamfara PDP governorship candidate sets 3-point agenda Ex-Gov.
