The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) yesterday said 2018 remains one of the most traumatic years for workers due to the failure of the federal government to enact and implement the new national minimum wage of N30,000. NLC President Ayuba Wabba stated this in his New Year goodwill message to Nigerian workers. Wabba said in spite of the unimpeachable tripartite process leading to the agreement by the social partners on the new national minimum wage, it is unfortunate that the federal government is yet to transmit to the National Assembly an executive bill for the enactment of N30,000 as the new national minimum wage. The NLC president accused the government of dilly-dallying on the issue which has strained government – labour relations that could trigger a major national strike in the next few days. He, however, appealed to the government to do the needful by urgently transmitting the bill on the new national minimum wage to the National Assembly, just as he urged workers to fully mobilize for a prolonged national strike and enforce their right. According to him, “This strike action is inevitable last option for us and we crave the understanding and support of all Nigerians and businesses. “We would want to assure workers that their labour, patience, and diligence will not be in vain and that this leadership remains committed to giving all that it takes to ensure that they get just and fair wages due to them in a decent work environment appropriate to their well-being.” He said the new year, which is the elections year, presents great opportunities for workers, pensioners, civil society allies and their friends and families to put their numbers to good use by voting out candidates who cannot serve their interest. He assured workers that the Congress would deepen its campaign for good governance and fight against corruption, tax justice, and illicit financial flows and ensuring that the recovered loot is transparently invested for the benefit of all Nigerians.
