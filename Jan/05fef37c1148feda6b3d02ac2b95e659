The Palestinian Authority has condemned Israel’s decision not to renew the mandate of a foreign observer force in the divided West Bank city of Hebron. The Temporary International Presence in Hebron (TIPH) has deployed unarmed civilians for more than 20 years to report on human rights violations. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the observers of “acting against” his country. Palestinians said Israel was showing contempt for international agreements. Saeb Erekat, of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, called on the UN to deploy a permanent international force across the occupied West Bank in response. Hebron has been a flashpoint for decades. The city is the location of the Tomb of the Patriarchs/Ibrahimi Mosque, which is revered by Jews, Muslim and Christians as Abraham, Isaac and Jacob’s burial place. The site is the second holiest in Judaism and the fourth holiest in Islam. Young Palestinian woman shot by Israeli forces dies Al-Aqsa: One encroachment too many?
