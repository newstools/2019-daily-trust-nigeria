The Court of Appeal in Abuja has nullified the judgement of an FCT High Court which declared Prof Jerry Gana the presidential candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) for the 2019 general elections. A three-man panel of justices presided by Justice Abdul Aboki, yesterday, restored former governor of Cross River State, Donald Duke, as the authentic candidate of the party. The appellate court in resolving all the issues in favour of Duke, ordered Gana to pay him the sum of N500,000 cost of the matter. The high court presided by Justice Hussein Baba-Yusuf had held that “The law has crystallised that political parties should abide by the regulations which they have made by themselves. The claimant laid sufficient evidence to have the judgment in his favour; it is a clear violation of the party’s constitution; the court cannot wave right over illegality.” But the Court of Appeal overruled the verdict and described it as “perverse and wrong”. It added that the issue of zoning is a political arrangement, which does not touch on a cause of action like the violation of the Electoral Act in the primary. Duke was announced the party’s candidate after he polled 816 votes, the highest number of votes in the party’s primary of October 6, 2018 in Abuja, against the 611 by Gana. Gana however challenged the vote at the high court contending that it was contrary to the party constitution, which provides that the national chairman and the presidential candidate of the party cannot come from the same zone.
