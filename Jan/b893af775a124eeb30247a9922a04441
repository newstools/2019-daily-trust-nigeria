Kuje Area Council Chairman, Alhaji Abdullahi D. Galadima, has said the council has put measures in place to address security challenges in the council. Galadima stated this when he received a delegation from the Institute of Security And Strategic Studies (ISSS) Lower Usuman Dam, Abuja, in his office yesterday. He said his administration had ensured that the insecurity in some of the wards was tackled headlong immediately he assumed office two years ago. He added that the council always summoned peace and security meetings in his office to brainstorm on areas where there were security threats. He noted, however, that the area witnessed some attacks and kidnapping at the end of last year, but that the council, through efforts of security agencies, were able to curtail the situation. “We have been able to do a lot in terms of security in Kuje Area Council since we assumed office and as I speak, measures have been put in place to tackle the security challenge which we don’t want to make open,” he said. Earlier, the director of ISSS, Abuja, Dr. Alfred A. Adeniyi, who led the delegation, told the chairman that they were on a study tour to the council to ascertain the security challenge in the area. According to him, the purpose of the visit was to have firsthand information on challenges faced by the APC-led administration, especially in the area of security. ‘I’m worried about increase in kidnapping’ Kuje boss assures residents of  security ahead primaries I never spent N1.6bn on capital projects - Kuje chair
