The PDP in Katsina State has called on Governor Aminu Masari to resign over his admission that the state is under siege by bandits and kidnappers. Speaking with newsmen, the state PDP chairman, Salisu Majigiri, said Masari had openly admitted his failure and the most appropriate thing for him was to step aside and allow those who could take charge. According to him, the declaration of the governor was scary and a contradiction to an early statement of  President Muhammadu Buhari who told the world that security had improved in Nigeria. “Our take is that Masari promised on assumption of office that security will be improved, but today he openly said there is no security. If the governor is not safe himself who else is?” Majigiri, who is also the PDP deputy gubernatorial candidate in Katsina, asked.
