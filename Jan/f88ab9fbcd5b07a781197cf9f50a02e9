Youths in Kogi State have been advised to eschew violence before, during and after the forthcoming general elections. Kogi State Coordinator of Interfaith Youth and Peace Building Network of Nigeria (IYPBNN), Itodo Michael Olachene, made the call yesterday in Lokoja at a one-day seminar organised by his organisation on how to use religion as a tool for violent-free elections. Olachene urged the youths not to allow politicians to use them to unleash mayhem on the people in the forthcoming elections under the guise of religious or tribal sentiments, saying they should go out peacefully and vote for candidates of their choice. 2Face launches ‘vote not  fight’ campaign in Kogi Coalition demands pronouncement by Buhari on Kogi, Bayelsa elections Elections: Cops warned against partisanship
