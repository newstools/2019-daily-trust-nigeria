Ethiopian Airlines, yesterday, commenced full operations from the new Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport Abuja. The Traffic and Sales Manager of Ethiopian Airlines, Mr Tilahun Tedesse, said: “We just started today in this new terminal and we will continue to be an example to other airlines.” Also commenting, Mr Sani Mahmud, the Regional Manager, North Central, Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), said the terminal had been fully equipped to handle all international carriers. Mahmud said the terminal had been equipped with fibre backbone which provides free internet services to all passengers and airport users. He expressed optimism that other airlines such as Emirates, Lufthansa, Egypt and British Airways would likely move their operations into the terminal in the next one week. “We are grateful for their cooperation and we hope that very soon, others will join continuously and we hope that within the next one week, Emirates will come in too. “When we have the two giants here, others will be jealous and eager to come. “Hopefully, all the airlines will come in within a week because the connections have been done. The duty free shops are in progress because the management wants a uniform style that will be of international standard and we are ready to provide world class services here,” he said. A passenger, Dr Ayodeji Samuels, a medical practitioner, commended the government for the project, saying it was befitting of the seat of power like Abuja.
