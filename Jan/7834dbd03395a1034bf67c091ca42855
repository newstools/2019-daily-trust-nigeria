A former gubernatorial aspirant of the PDP in Gombe State, Alhaji Jamilu Isyaku Gwamna, has donated a 60-seater bus for the campaign of President Muhammadu Buhari and APC gubernatorial candidate in the state, Alhaji Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya. Speaking with newsmen yesterday in Gombe after handing over the bus, Gwamna said the donation was to ease movement of party members during the campaign. Gwamna, who defected to the APC after losing the PDP ticket to Senator Usman Bayero Nafada, said he was determined to ensure the success of the party’s candidates at the polls. “I donated this bus not because I want anything back but because I have a special interest in the wellbeing of people of Gombe state and Nigerians. I have promised to work for Buhari and Inuwa Yahaya’s victory and this gesture is part of fulfilling that promise,” he said. Gwamna added that apart from the bus, he has already handed over his campaign structures and instructed his teeming supporters to vote for the APC flag bearer and other candidates fielded by the party in the state.
