Wife of the President, Aisha Buhari has reconsidered her earlier threats not to support her husband, Muhammadu Buhari in his second term bid if certain things were not changed. Mrs Buhari drew worldwide attention when she criticised her husband in an October 2016 interview with the BBC, saying she feared his administration was veering from its mandate to the people. She also expressed doubt that she would support him if he seeks re-election unless he implemented immediate changes in personnel and policies. She has now constituted a campaign team for him despite her threats. The team is made up of wife of the Vice President, Dolapo Osinbajo, Senators, Governors wives, Ministers, former governors, head of federal agencies and entertainers for her husband second term bid. The team, with about 700 members, drawn from across the country would be inaugurated on Thursday by President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja, according to a statement by Aisha’s spokesperson, Suleiman Haruna. Aisha is chairing the team herself while the Vice President’s wife would co-chair it. The duo of Mrs. Adejoke O. Adefulure and wife of Nasarawa Governor, Mrs. Mairo Al-Makura would serve as Vice chairpersons for South and North respectively. Haj. Salamatu Baiwa Umar – Eluma is the National Coordinator of the team, Barr. Juliet Ibekaku-Nwagu (Dep. Nat. Coordinator – South) and Haj. Binta Muazu (Dep. Nat. Coordinator – North).
