Hundreds of Zimbabwean lawyers have taken to the streets of the capital, Harare, to call for the government and the judiciary to respect the law following violent protests that broke out a fortnight ago. They singled out the judiciary for being complicit in human rights violations committed during operations to clampdown on protests that were sparked by the hiking fuel prices. Security officers are alleged to have beaten members of the public and committed rape. The lawyers criticised what they said was the judiciaryâ€™s fast tracking of trials of protesters, the denial of bail and disregard for constitutional provisions. They called on judges and magistrates to afford all accused people their rights as enshrined in the constitution. More than 1,000 people were arrested following the countrywide demonstrations. Police could not provide accurate figures of the numbers detained but police spokesperson Charity Charamba said in one suburb in Harare 14 minors were detained on various charges including public violence and arson.
