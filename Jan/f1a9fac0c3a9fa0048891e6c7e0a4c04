A 30-year-old man has been charged to court for allegedly setting ablaze a shanty house, killing a woman and her three children, who were residing in the house. The accused person, Shola Adewunmi, according the prosecutor, Sgt. Emah Jerry, committed the offence around 5.00 a.m. on Dec. 17, at No. 21, Anjorin St., Power line, Alagbado, Lagos. Jeery said the accused set ablaze the house where Mrs Gbenke Omonitan, and her three children occupied. “The accused set the house ablaze after an altercation he had with the deceased,” the prosecutor added. The offence contravened Section 223 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The accused is facing a charge of arson and murder, but his plea was not taken when he was brought before an Ebute Meta Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos on Friday. His counsel, Spurgeon Ataene, urged the court to grant his client bail, arguing that the evidence did not link the accused to the offence. In her ruling, the Chief Magistrate, Mr O.O. Olatunji, granted N200, 000 bail to the accused and asked him to provide two sureties as part of the bail condition. Olatunji held that the evidence before the court did not link the accused to the crime. “The remand application brought by the police also showed neither finger print evidence nor forensic report showing that the accused committed the offence,” he said The case was thereafter adjourned to Feb. 7 for mention.
