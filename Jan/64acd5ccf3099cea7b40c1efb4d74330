The Senate, yesterday, mandated its committee on aviation to probe alleged faulty air conditioning system of a Nigerian airline with a view to preventing any disaster. The Senate took the decision following a motion by Senate Whip Sola Adeyeye, who said he was disturbed by a development he personally experienced in an airline. He said he had boarded Arik Air more than once and discovered that its air conditioning system was faulty, a development he described as a “serious danger.” “I want to alert us that some of our aircraft are not working well. I boarded Arik Air one time and their air conditioner was not working. The first time they said they were working on it, then I also observed that for the second time. “On the second occasion, they said they were working on it. I’m disturbed about this development. If this continues, it’s a disaster waiting to happen,” the senator said. After his submission, Senate President Bukola Saraki directed the aviation committee to swing into action and get back to the Senate within one week.
