Stakeholders of APC in Jos South Local Government Area of Plateau State have described the recent defection of the member representing Jos South/Jos East Federal Constituency, Edward Pwajok as a political suicide that would make him irrelevant in the scheme of things. Pwajok had last Saturday, along with some APC members defected to the PDP during the campaign rally of the party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, in Jos, the Plateau State capital. Addressing newsmen, yesterday in Jos, spokesman of the APC stakeholders, Ayuba Pam, said Pwajok’s defection was not surprising because such was his character. He said the development would not affect APC in Jos South in any way. “His defection was long anticipated after he failed to secure the senatorial ticket of Plateau North Senatorial Zone of our great party, the APC. To those of us, his political associates who know him and to those who have followed his political antecedents, that he decamped  to the PDP was not surprising; he was merely demonstrating a character trend he is known with close to three decades that he has been in active politics,” he said. “We have resolved to carry on and vowed to ensure total victory for the party in Jos South. We want to make it abundantly clear that we have total confidence in the capabilities and doggedness of the management committee chairman, Hon. Dr. Gideon Dung Davou, to lead the entire local government to victory in this coming election,” he added.
