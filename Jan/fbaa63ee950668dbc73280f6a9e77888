The Federal Government has okayed Kano State government’s proposal of 540 megawatt Qua Iboe Power Plant (QIPP) for the re-industrialisation plan of the state. The Minister of Finance, Mrs Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed, gave the Federal Government’s assurance yesterday, when she received Kano State Governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and his team in Abuja. The minister in a statement signed by her special Adviser on media and communications, Mr Paul Ella Abechi, said, “Let me assure you that it is not an issue of if this project will take place but when, because we have a very huge power gap and it is more in the northern part than in the south. And when we see an opportunity like this, we have the responsibility to ensure it comes to fruition.” She also said, “We are looking at this as a pilot project as it will help mitigate Federal Government’s plan. The ability to provide a counter guarantee will go a long way to reduce the burden on the Federal Government.” She added that it will help to improve the industrialisation plan, growth and employment generation for the state. “I want to make a commitment that the Ministry of Finance will put up our best efforts to make it a success. I hope at the end of the day it will be on record that during my tenure that I contributed to the industrialisation of Kano,” she added. Earlier, Governor Ganduje had said he had been fully briefed of the meeting between the Ministry of Finance and the board of BlackRhino Group, which was chaired by the Emir of Kano, His Highness, Muhammad Sanusi II, assured that the state government will provide protection against the financial risk of the power project. The governor noted that the project is worth billions of dollars and when completed it will aid the industrialisation drive of the state.
