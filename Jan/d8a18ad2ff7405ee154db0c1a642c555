A former president, Olusegun Obasanjo, on Thursday, said the world was waiting to see the contributions of President Muhammadu Buhari and other West African leaders to deepening democracy in the forthcoming elections. The former president spoke in Abuja where he chaired a public presentation of a book “Politics as a Dashed Hopes in Nigeria” authored by Dr Auwalu Anwar. Obasanjo said the success of President Buhari at the 2015 polls strengthened Nigeria’s democracy but the international community is watching his contributions to consolidating the gains. Between 2019 and 2020, major elections will hold in Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal and Cote d’ivoire. “In these four countries, the incumbents were in the opposition and took over power from the ruling parties. It was good for democracy. “The world is waiting, in the incoming elections, to see what will be their contributions to cumulatively strengthen, deepen and stabilize democracy in each of these countries,” he said. Obasanjo, however, urged Nigerians to protect Nigeria’s fledgling democracy, pledging that he would “do everything humanly possible to safeguard our democracy and ensure good governance.” 2019: Can Obasanjo’s romance with Yoruba leaders stop Buhari?
