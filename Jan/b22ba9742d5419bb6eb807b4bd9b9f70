Following spate of reported violence at many of the political campaign venues in the state, Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River state has directed the state’s Commissioner of Police to immediately commence a Stop and Search of all political parties’ campaign convoys. In a statement signed on Monday by his media aide, Christian Ita, the governor alleged that many of the campaign vehicles, especially those of the oppositions were laden with illegal arms. He said there were security reports that confirmed that certain politicians were also stockpiling arms and ammunition. “This directive is imperative following security reports that indicate that some politicians and their supporters were stockpiling arms and ammunitions ahead of the forthcoming elections,” it stated. Also today, the governor paid a visit to some hospitals in Calabar to see some of his supporters who were allegedly attacked by the oppositions in the northern parts of the state over the weekend during the gubernatorial campaign. Ayade described the violence and attack against his supporters as mundane and barbaric, assuring the citizens however of adequate security before, during and after the election.
