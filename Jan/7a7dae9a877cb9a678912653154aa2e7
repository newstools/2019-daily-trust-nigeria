Wife of the president, Hajiya Aisha Muhammadu Buhari has launched the women and youth campaign for her husband in Kano on Saturday. Speaking at the official launching of the 2019 general election campaign for women and youth at Sani Abacha Indoor Stadium, Kano, Aisha was optimistic that her husband would win election in 2019. She said she joined her husband in campaign in 2015 because of the laudable empowerment programmes the All Progressive Congress planned for Nigerians. She said, “These programmes are now being implemented by the FG through the office of the vice president.” “In 2015, my husband won election without given a penny to Nigerians, therefore, I am optimistic that come February 16, he will again win election,” he hoped. He urged women and youth across the country to vote for Buhari and other APC candidates at all levels. On his part, Kano State Governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje assured the president that Kano would deliver more votes for him come February 16. Ganduje said the APC-led government had executed laudable projects in the state and the electorates would no doubt re-elect the party in the subsequent elections.
