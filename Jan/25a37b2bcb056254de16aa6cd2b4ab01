Nigerians misunderstanding President Muhammadu Buhari’s leadership style is due to their inability to appreciate him as a statesman in politics. The Deputy Director General of the Buhari Presidential Campaign Council, Arc. Waziri Bulama, made this observation in a chat with newsmen yesterday in Maiduguri. “Having ruled this country in the military administration; having attained the rank of a major general in the Nigerian Army; and having participated in managing the country’s affairs in many capacities at the highest level, Buhari sees himself as a statesman in politics, and this is what people should know,” Arc. Bulama said. He described President Buhari as a statesman-leader who was guided in the conduct of leadership and governance by a mission to save and serve the country in the tradition of statesmen who found themselves in leadership capacities. The Buhari top campaign official said, guided by this mission, President Buhari had always tried to maintain his freedom from the entrapments of partisanship, saying, “Unlike some of the country’s past leaders who could not divorce leadership from partisanship, Buhari keeps leadership away from partisanship as he handles the delicate task of balancing partisanship with leadership and statesmanship in the pursuit of the mission of saving and serving Nigeria.” Ibrahim Ahmadu Coomassie []1942 -2018] Bamanga Tukur quits politics, supports Buhari’s govt Buhari orders immediate rescue of kidnapped Falae
