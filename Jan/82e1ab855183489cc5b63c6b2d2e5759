The Kano State Branch of Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) says it will not comply with its national body’s order to boycott courts nationwide from Tuesday, Jan. 29. The national body of NBA has ordered its members nationwide to boycott courts for two days to protest the suspension of Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen. The branch made its position known in a statement signed by its Secretary, Malam Mujtaba Ameen, in Kano on Tuesday. “We at Kano NBA Branch have decided that we will not ask any member of our branch to boycott courts for two days. “We should be responsible enough to do the best for our country, Nigeria, families, clients and the system as a whole,’’ he said. “We should endeavor to preserve the nobleness of our highly respected profession by being fair to the society and our children yet unborn,’’ Ameen said. A correspondent of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), who visited some Magistrates’ and Federal High Courts in Kano on Tuesday, reports that most of the judges reported for duties and entertain cases.
