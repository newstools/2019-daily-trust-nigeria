The Cyril Abeye Ogodo/Olorogun O’tega Emerhor-led faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Delta State has dissociated from the scheduled inauguration of the Delta APC gubernatorial campaign council this Saturday. In a statement signed by the Delta APC factional state chairman, Chief Cyril Abeye Ogodo, Friday, directed its members to boycott the inauguration ceremony and not to serve in the proposed committees. Chief Ogodo however said his faction is not averse to reconciliation, provided it is total and genuine based on equity, fairness and justice. The Media Director, Great Ogboru Campaign Organisation, Zik Zulu Okafor, had issued notice of the inauguration of the Delta APC Governorship Council this Saturday. The media director said the event is not a rally, rather “it is for the inauguration of the different committees for the governorship campaign at all levels from the state, LGAs to the wards and units. “It is, therefore, not envisioned to be a crowdy occasion. It is purely a strategic event, tactical in concept and execution to achieve a decisive victory at the governorship polls”, Okafor had stated.
