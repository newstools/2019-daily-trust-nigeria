The Chairman, Coalition of Civilian Joint Taskforce (CJTF) Kaduna State chapter, Shehu Usman Dan Tudu, on Tuesday said the group is not working for the state governor, Nasir El-Rufai, because they are apolitical group. He said that their priority as a local security group is to protect their communities and not a political party. Shehu Dan Tudu disclosed this while speaking to news men during a New Year celebration organised by the Peace Revival and Reconciliation Foundation of Nigeria at the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) Secretariat   in the state. He described speculation going round in the state that they are working for the state government as fake news. The chairman explained that as a group, they are only concern with providing security to their communities against hoodlums. “We are not working for PDP; we are not working for APC or any other political parties in the state. We are only civilian JTF that are only concern in protecting our communities from hoodlums and criminals. “Just because we attended APC events doesn’t mean we are working for them because if the PDP or any other party invited us to provide security for them we will go. “We will always be neutral; so, we are not working for the present governor and all the reports going around that we are working for the state government is fake news because we are for everybody,” he said Dan Tudu added that they are working in collaboration with other security agencies in the state.
