The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) will soon commence the construction of more classrooms and employment of teachers in order to improve standard and to decongest the classrooms. FCT Education Secretary Dr. Bala Mohammed Liman dropped this hint while speaking with a section of the media during an inspection of resumption of schools in Abuja, last week. He noted that it was the obligation of the FCTA, through the secretariat, to ensure maintenance of standards in schools. “We need to do two things to decongest schools; we need to build more classrooms and we need to have more teachers. We need to do these things together, and that is what we intend to do, and that is why we’ve asked each school and board to try and come up with their needs requirement so that we know exactly what we need to do. “There is no point saying that we are going to do this or that, because we do not know exactly what each school requires,” he said. Also speaking on the essence of the visit to the schools and findings made during the visit, Dr. Liman said: “Usually when schools resume, we go round to see how they are settling down; students and teachers’ resumption and whether they have any niggling problems that we can try and fix immediately.”  Why Kano govt built French, Chinese schools – Commissioner UBEC boss appeals to state governments to access their FGN/UBE funds We’re making effort to improve infrastructures in FCT schools – Isah Maina
