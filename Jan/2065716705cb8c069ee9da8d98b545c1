The FCT senatorial candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Dr. Johnson Somadina Anene, has said his quest to represent the people of the territory in the National Assembly is not for selfish ambition, but a call to serve the people. Anene, who made the pledge, yesterday, in Abuja at a press conference, said his quest for vying for the senatorial seat, is not an ambition, but a call to serve and that he was ready, qualified and capable to do that. “I can assure you that I am eminently qualified and can handle it very well. It has long been overdue and there is need to replace the incumbent senator, because we know he has not done well. Everybody knows that he has been there but the people cannot point at a particular thing tangible that he has been able to achieve. “He has not been able to achieve the good representation of the people of the FCT.  FCT is quite vast and the population is growing by the day, and for that reason, we need somebody that is upward looking,” Anene said. While saying he would sponsor a bill that will touch the lives of the people when he gets to the Senate, he added that he has lived in the FCT for 28 years and has contributed immensely to the development of the people in the territory. “Even before I started aspiring to be in the Senate, I have been doing charity and philanthropic works and have been serving the people and doing projects that have create jobs and empowerment programmes with the little funds that God has blessed me with. “So, I know the needs of the people because l am one of you and suffer the same set of problems. I also suffered from them just the way you people suffer too, as my own situation and conditions are not different from yours. So, l know where the shoe pinches,” he said. ‘Mu’azu is not imposing Yayale on Bauchi people’ 2019: Era of cabal ended in Idoma land – Onoja The men eyeing David Mark’s job
