Former Deputy Governor of Ekiti state and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate in last year’s governorship election in the state, Prof. Kolapo Olusola has described the tribunal judgement as perversion of truth of the highest order and rape of democracy. His petition against the winner of the election, Dr. Kayode Fayemi was dismissed by the tribunal in its judgement in Abuja on Monday. Prof. Olusola, in a statement by his media aide, Onaopemipo Akinloye, said the judgement of the tribunal upholding the victory of Fayemi cannot stand “because it doesn’t represent the truth” and vowed to appeal it. Olusola said he was surprised that despite the avalanche of evidence of massive electoral fraud allegedly committed by  the APC and the INEC which he placed before the tribunal, the tribunal still validate Fayemi’s election. He said, “I feel sad for democracy in this country. Future of democracy in this country is not guarantee. I will challenge this judgement at the upper court until I get victory essentially for the numerous Ekiti people that came out to cast their votes for me.” He therefore appealed to his numerous supporters and PDP members to remain calm and continue in their prayers, assuring that victory will come their way soon. Meanwhile, Ekiti State Deputy Governor, Otunba Bisi Egbeyemi, has said the victory will motivate Fayemi to do more for the people. Egbeyemi, in a statement by his Special Assistant (Media), Odunayo Ogunmola, said the judicial affirmation has confirmed that Fayemi and the APC actually won the July 14, 2018 governorship election. He said the verdict would strengthen the APC in the state ahead of the general elections in the state.
