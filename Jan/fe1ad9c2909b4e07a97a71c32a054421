Members of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Tika village of Kuje Area Council, have told the chairman, Abdullahi D. Galadima, that they regretted their mistake of voting for PDP in the last election. A former PDP leader in Tika, under Rubochi ward of the council, Mr. Ayi Gyiayegbe, stated this when he led 1,245 members of the PDP to APC, yesterday, in the area, saying such mistake would not repeat itself in the February and March general elections. He said their decision to dump the PDP for APC was informed by the performance of the Galadima-led administration in Kuje, noting that the chairman had touched the lives of people irrespective of political differences. He said he would ensure that the PDP members, especially women and youth, who defected to APC worked assiduously for the victory of the party right from the presidency down to councillorship positions. The council chairman, Alhaji Abdullahi D. Galadima, who received the defectors, commended them for identifying with the APC, saying his administration had always operated an open door policy. He assured the defectors that being the leader of the APC in the council, he would ensure that they were carried along in whatever decision the party was making.
