The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to “stop his dictatorial tendencies” and guarantee a free, fair and credible general election. Addressing a press conference this morning at Yar’adu Center in Abuja, Atiku said Buhari benefited from a free and fair election in 2015 and should do same under his watch. Atiku, a former Vice President, also called on Nigerians to vote out the All Progressives Congress (APC) led government in the general elections, adding that Nigeria does not deserve “an undemocratic and tyranical” government. Atiku condemned the suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Walter Onnoghen, saying it is not about whether the CJN was guilty or not, but about the “illegality” of the process that led to his suspension.
