The Consumer Protection Council (CPC) has provided an online channel to aid Nigerian consumers in an on-going recall of Hyundai Sonata and Hyundai Santa Fe Sport cars whose engines were replaced under two previous recalls. The CPC’s Director General, Mr Babatunde Irukera, stated this in a statement yesterday in Abuja. The Hyundai Motor Company in the United States announced a further recall on January 16, 2019, of approximately 100,000  2011 to 2015 Hyundai Sonata and 2013 to 2014 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport vehicles whose engines were replaced under two previous recalls to inspect the fuel tube installation. The on-going recall is to inspect and confirm proper reinstallation of the fuel tube to the high-pressure fuel pump. The company also seeks to update its engine monitoring technology with a new device known as a knock sensor detection system. Irukera said, “Although the recall originated in North America, it is not inconceivable that some of the vehicles affected ended up in the Nigerian market, either primarily or secondarily.” He also disclosed that “as an additional method to determine either of these possibilities, the council is engaging appointed Hyundai dealers in Nigeria.’’
