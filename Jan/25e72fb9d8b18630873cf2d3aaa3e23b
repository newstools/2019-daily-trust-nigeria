The National Association of Nigerian Traders (NANTS) has said that Nigeria has a lot to lose compared to expected gains from the e-commerce negotiations and signing with the World Trade Organisation (WTO). President of NANTS, Mr Ken Ukaoha, said in Abuja that the e-commerce negotiation rules have many implications yet to be examined and that it may not even be beneficial to Nigeria and its economy. He said it is important that Nigeria learnt from other treaties that it was trying to withdraw from because they were detrimental to its economy and her citizens’ interests. He said Nigeria’s representatives during the 11th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC11) held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in December 2017, committed the country to some agreements and declarations including the European Free Trade Association Joint Declaration on Corporation comprising Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland; Friends of Investment Facilitation for Development; and Friends of Ecommerce for Development.
