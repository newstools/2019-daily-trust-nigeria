The Lagos State governor, Mr Akinwunmi Ambode, yesterday swore in the state’s 21st Head of Service (HoS), Hakeem Muri-Okunola. Forty six-year-old Muri-Okunola was described as the youngest ever HoS in the history of the state civil service. The swearing-in ceremony was witnessed by the National Leader of the All Progressive Congress (APC) and former Lagos State governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, and the House of Representatives Majority Leader, Femi Gbajabiamila, among other personalities. At the ceremony, Gov Ambode asked the new HoS to inject fresh ideas, vibrancy and new energy that would take the public service to new heights and make Lagos a globally recognized city-state with a commitment to efficiency, effectiveness, innovation and creativity in service delivery. According to the governor the appointment was a new chapter in the history of the state public service. Expressing strong optimism in the ability of Muri-Okunola to effectively take charge on account of his capacity, knowledge, exposure, experience and youthful energy, Gov Ambode said it was important for the new Head to lead by example and encourage accountability and professionalism. “As the number one Civil Servant in Lagos State, you must demonstrate leadership and lead by example for others, including the Body of Permanent Secretaries, to follow. You have a responsibility to provide direction and encourage accountability, transparency, professionalism and a high sense of discipline,” he said. Responding, Muri-Okunola thanked Gov Ambode for the confidence and trust reposed in him, assuring that the public service, under him, would improve on all well-known traditions for speedy, efficient and effective implementation of government policies and initiatives.
