Policemen attached to the Lion Building Division, Lagos, on Monday arrested four middle-aged men who allegedly posed as commercial tricycle operators and passengers to assault and rob their victims. The men  –  Kazeem Lateef, Olayemi Ayomide, Oladimeji Olamilekan and Sodiq Atobatele  –  were said to have conspired on December 31, 2018 at about 10am on Igbosere Road, Lagos, to commit robbery. The suspects were said to have, while pretending to be commercial tricycle operators and passengers, deceived one Hunwanu Sesi Adebayo into boarding their commercial tricycle. Inside the tricycle, the suspects allegedly threatened to use violence on Adebayo if he failed to surrender his phone and wallet and, in the process, pushed him out of the moving tricycle, causing him body injuries. A member of the gang, Ayomide, was said to have been nabbed on December 31, 2018 at about 4pm at the Falomo flyover bridge, Lagos. He was, while trying to escape arrest, alleged to have assaulted one Omowole Edwardson with an iron rim that caused the latter an injury in the forehead. The gang, according to the police, also operated at Surulere, Lagos, while pretending as commercial tricycle operators and passengers. They were said to have used the ploy to deceive one Adekanbi Olabusayo to board their tricycle as a passenger and forcefully collected from him one Samsung C5 phone worth N129,000, a wallet containing four ATM cards, a driver licence, an NYSC identity card and a sum of N2,000. They allegedly threatened Olabusayo with grievous harm if he didn’t comply with their demand. The police said the suspects would soon appear in court.
