The minister of Interior, Abdulrahman Dambazau, has assured Nigerians that there won’t be any breakdown of law and order during this year’s general elections. Dambazau gave the assurance ,in a statement on Thursday, signed by the Director of Press and Public Relations in the ministry, Mohammed Manga. “President Muhammadu Buhari is committed to free and fair elections in 2019 and this can only be possible if politicians give peace a chance by avoiding all forms of political thuggery and violence in their struggle to get elected”, he quoted the minister as saying. Dambazau pointed out that, security agencies have been directed to ensure adequate security of lives and property before, during, and after the general elections. He re-iterated that “it is prohibited for anyone to possess any type of weapon(s) during rallies or elections, the violation of which will attract arrest and possible prosecution. The Nigeria Police has been directed to ensure enforcement of law and order during such events”. He therefore advised youth in the country not to allow themselves to be used by desperate politicians who want power at all cost and may influence them into political violence over little gratification, at the detriment of their lives and future.
