The Governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State, Buruji Kashamu has vowed to guarantee full Local Government financial autonomy if elected on March 2 gubernatorial election in the state. He spoke when he led his campaign train to visit Alake of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Gbadebo in his Ake Palace in Abeokuta. Kashamu, who represents Ogun East Senatorial District at the National Assembly, argued that lack of resource control by council chairmen had been the bane of underdevelopment at the grassroots in Nigeria. He also promised to raise thousands of business women across the state as part of “stomach infrastructure scheme” to fight poverty. “I want to pledge that my own government will be the last government that would hijack Local Government funds. I will sign undertaken in that regard. The problems we have seen in many states in the country is that Local Government administrations are not allowed to manage their allocations directly in a way that would guarantee development at the grassroots. “I pledge that, my own government will never, be it four years or eight years, sit on local government areas allocations for a second. I will allow the funds to flow down into the LG accounts for the chairmen to decide on how to use it for the development of their areas.” In his response, Oba Gbadebo urged Kashamu to walk the talk if emerged as governor in the interest of the state.
