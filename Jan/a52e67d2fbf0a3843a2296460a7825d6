The National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, said yesterday, that PDP presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar travelled to the United States of America (USA) after 12 years and returned to the country “like a fugitive.” Issa-Onilu, who fielded questions from journalists in Abuja on varying issues, said the trip did not give space or airtime to any serious media organisation. “The issue of Atiku coming to America came up when I was not around. He went like a fugitive and returned like a fugitive. It’s not a trip anyone here will like to make. Even in America, no video evidence of meeting with government officials of note. He went to Voice of America and spoke with VOA Hausa Service. He should have done that in Nigeria,” he said. Speaking on the same issue, the APC Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) said yesterday that Atiku sneaked into the US “under a special diplomatic cover.” Spokesman of the PCC, Barrister Festus Keyamo, who stated this in a statement, said the visit was nothing but a downright catastrophe. “For the candidate of the major opposition party in Nigeria, it is an absolute disaster that the visit was not announced ahead of time in Nigeria, with his programmes and itinerary clearly spelt out, the decent and customary minimum standard of such visits,” he said. He said it was shameful that a presidential candidate of a major opposition party in Africa’s most populous country would visit America, and the international press was kept in the dark. …Atiku raising false alarm - APC PDP campaign has crash-landed – APC APC mocks PDP campaign in Kogi
