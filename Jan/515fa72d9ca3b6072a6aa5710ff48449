The Peoples Democratic Party Presidential Campaign Organization (PPCO) says the haste by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to haul insults at the PDP and defend the All Progressives Congress (APC) over the alleged pressure on it to drop the display of results at polling center, showed that INEC was being compromised ahead of the polls. This was contained in a statement signed by Kola Ologbondiyan, the Director, Media & Publicity of PDP Presidential Campaign Organization, and made available to Daily Trust Online on Thursday morning. He said Nigerians were shocked when the INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, through his media aide, hauled insults at the PDP as “hallucinating” in response to PDP’s caution to the commission not to succumb to pressure and enticements by the APC and the Buhari Presidency to drop the result display and the electronic transmission of results to its main server. “In resorting to insults and engaging in a campaign of calumny instead of words of assurances to stakeholders, INEC has made a dive into the arena and accentuated anxieties by Nigerians as well as the international community that it is being compromised by the APC and the Buhari Presidency. “However, these needless insult of our party notwithstanding, we shall continue to hold the Prof Yakubu-led INEC to its responsibility to deliver a transparent, free, fair and credible 2019 general election,” the statement noted in part. The PPCO said nothing will deter it from monitoring all the processes leading to this year’s general elections and hold the commission accountable on every perceived infraction. It restated that on no account must INEC drop the display of results at the polling units and the electronic transmission of results to its server from its guidelines. The PDP Presidential Campaign also insisted that it will reject any plan to use former National Youths Service Corps (NYSC) members as polls officials, stressing that “this will amount to handing over the electoral process directly to the APC and the Buhari Presidency.”
