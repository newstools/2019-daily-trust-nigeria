Governor Mohammed Abdullahi Abubakar has stated that the people defeated by the All Progressives Congress (APC) are planning to come back and return Nigeria to the inglorious, dark Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) days. He disclosed this while addressing APC supporters in Misau saying that Nigerians should come out to vote for the APC so that the country consolidates on the gains made by the All Progressives Congress led administrations in the past three and a half years. He urged electorates to vote out politicians who had the opportunity but failed to transform and turn around the country’s economy but chose to destroy it. “If we don’t come out and vote, we’re only voting for the return of the inglorious past. The only way we can ensure that projects and programmes that have direct bearing on the life of the common man initiated by our Party are sustained is by coming out to vote for us again. Those we defeated in 2015 are planning to come back and return us to the woods. We must stop them,” he warned.
