Police in Brazil have arrested five people as part of an investigation into Friday’s dam collapse in Brumadinho. At least 65 people died when toxic sludge engulfed a company canteen and neighbouring residential buildings. Prosecutors in Brazil say three of those arrested were officials from the mining company Vale, whose responsibilities included dealing with environmental impact licences. Vale said it was co-operating with prosecutors. The company is the world’s biggest producer of iron ore and nickel.
