The Nigerian Electricity Management Services Agency (NEMSA) has commissioned surveillance equipment for remote monitoring of the National Meter Test Stations (NMTS) where 67,292 meters have been certified since October 2017. The Managing Director of NEMSA, Engr. Peter Ewesor, at the commissioning and launching of the agency’s Conditions of Service in Abuja, yesterday, said “the security surveillance equipment being commissioned enables NEMSA management at the headquarters to monitor real-time on-line 24/7, the operations and activities in its three NMTS at Oshodi-Lagos, Kaduna and Port Harcourt.” It can also be scaled up to accommodate  test stations being built in Enugu, Bauchi and Kano. The system also has a data storage system where information is stored and retrieved for review in the case of security breach. On the Conditions of Service, Ewesor said the document will guide the engagement and administration of staff in the agency. The Minister of State, Power, Works and Housing, Mr Mustapha Baba Shehuri, said the agency has recorded much success in its four years of existence especially in producing the Conditions of Service document.
