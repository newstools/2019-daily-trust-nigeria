The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) has demanded the removal of Mrs. Amina Zakari as the collation officer of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for this year’s general elections. HURIWA in a statement signed by its management, yesterday, also demanded the removal of the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Ibrahim Idris, who is due for retirement upon attaining the statutory age of 60 on January 15. The CSO, said it will in the next 48 hours coalesce with 35 other CSOs in requesting the intervention of the National Assembly and all the organisations that partner with INEC including the UN and major world leaders over the issue. “We will serve a petition to the President of the Senate because of the ongoing troubling threats to the integrity and credibility of INEC which surely have the potency of undermining the 2019 general elections,” it said. “As we are aware, the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic Nigeria (as amended) legitimately empowers the Senate with the powers to confirm the nominees of the Executive President to INEC in Section 154 (1) and to remove in Section 157 (1). “Relatedly, take note that Section 14 (2a) and (3b) of Third Schedule Part 1 strongly emphasise that: “a member of the commission shall – be non-partisan and a person of unquestionable integrity.” 2019: PDP asks Abdulsalami peace panel, world leaders to caution Buhari PDP campaign seeks intervention of peace panel, world leaders PPCO asks N/Assembly to prevail on Buhari to remove Zakari from INEC
