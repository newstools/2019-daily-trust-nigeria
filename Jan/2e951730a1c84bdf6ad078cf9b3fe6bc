Following the dissolution of the Board of Niger Delta Development Commission, (NDDC) and appointment of an acting Managing Director, the erstwhile helmsman Obong Nsima Ekere, is now fully focused on his governorship campaigns. Ekere, who recently resigned as the Managing Director of the NDDC, is contesting the governorship of Akwa Ibom State, under the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday dissolved the Board and approved the appointment of Nelson Braimbraifa from Bayelsa State as acting Managing Director. The entrance of Ekere in the governorship race has changed the political narrative in the state as many see him as veritable opposition to wrestle power from the incumbent Governor, Emmanuel Udom. Speaking recently, Ekere lamented what he called extreme poverty in the state, adding that the forthcoming election would be an avenue for him to change the plight of the people. The governorship candidate, who said he would now channel his energy towards ensuring success at the polls, wondered why “Akwa Ibom people should suffer untold hardship and poverty amidst the huge resources and federal allocations accrued to the state”. He promised to create jobs for the teeming unemployed youths in the state and an enabling environment for the private economy to thrive when elected. The former NNDC Managing Director anchored his developmental agenda for the state on creation of wealth by building on the foundation laid by past leaders of the state.
