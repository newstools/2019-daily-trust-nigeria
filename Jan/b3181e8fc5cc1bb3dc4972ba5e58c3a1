The European Centre for Electoral Support (ECES) has called on security forces to display the highest sense of professionalism in handling issues of election security during the forthcoming general elections. The Project Director of ECES, Rudolf Elbling, who made the call during a trainers’ workshop for election security personnel for the 2019 general election in Abuja at the weekend, said the conduct of hitch free and credible elections requires a peaceful environment devoid of threat to lives and properties. He noted that security agencies have a critical role to play in securing the electoral process, especially in view of reported cases of security breaches in certain parts of the country. Describing the training organized by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) with the support of the ECES, as a major step towards enhancing the security of the 2019 polls, Elbling said: “Election officials can only discharge their responsibilities of organizing elections, including deployment and retrieval of materials in a secured environment. “It is therefore a matter of consolation that INEC has taken a major step towards enhancing the security of the 2019 election through the conduct of this important training taking place in the 36 states of the federation and the FCT and will be replicated in all the 109 senatorial zones across the country”, he said. While restating the commitment of the ECES Nigeria to partner with INEC under the European Union Support to Democratic Governance in Nigeria (EUSDGN), he expressed the hope that the two day training would improve the skills and strengthen commitment of security agencies to promptly respond to cases of security threats before, during and after the 2019 polls. The Administrative Secretary of INEC in the FCT, Nick Dazang, described the training as timely, saying elections cannot be conducted successfully without security. “Security personnel have to conduct themselves professionally in accordance with international best practices”, Dazang said, stressing that violence diminishes the electoral process.
