The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has moved the collection of the Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) to the 207 Registration Areas (RAs) in the 17 Local Government Areas of Plateau. Mr. Osaretin Imahiyereobo, the Head, Voter Education and Publicity of INEC in the state announced this in a statement on Monday in Jos. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that before now, the collection of PVCs were done at the local government offices of the commission, a process that most voters described as too cumbersome and slow. According to Imahiyereobo, the exercise which will hold between Jan. 16 and 21, is aimed at easing the collection process. “As part of efforts to ensure registered voters participate fully in the forthcoming elections, we have devolved the collection of PVCs in Plateau to 207 Registration Areas in the 17 LGAs from Jan., 16 to Jan. 21 WATCH ALSO: “All voters who registered, applied for transfer, replacement of lost and defaced cards during the CVR exercises that lasted between April 2017 and Aug., 2018, are enjoined to utilise the six days exercise to visit the RAs where they registered, applied for transfer and replacement to collect their cards.’’ Imahiyereobo said the Commission in the state had taken delivery of 25,777 additional PVCs for those whose cards were omitted, those who applied for replacement of lost cards, defaced and some unprinted cards for those who registered in 2015. He explained that the addition brings the number of PVCs available for collection in the State to 334,707 as at last weekend.
