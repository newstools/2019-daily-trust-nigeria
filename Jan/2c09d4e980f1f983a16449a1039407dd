The crisis rocking the Social Democratic Party (SDP) over its presidential candidature deepened yesterday as youth asked the party’s National Chairman, Chief Olu Falae to submit the name of Prof. Jerry Gana to the electoral body as the presidential candidate within 24 hours, pending an alternative judgement by the Higher Court. The SDP national youth leader, Nwanka Stanley, who addressed journalists in Abuja, also demanded the resignation of the party’s National Secretary, Alhaji Shehu Gabam, within the next 24 hours having become the running mate of Donald Duke. Stanley said Gana’s name should be submitted to INEC considering the fact that the case had lingered since December 14th 2018, when the High Court ruling was given and also in fairness to the enormous contribution of Prof. Gana to the party. He promised to take an alternative action which he refused to disclose at the expiration of the ultimatum. Meanwhile, Professor Gana had accused Chief Falae and Gabam of acting a script following his refusal to submit his (Gana’s) name to the electoral body as SDP’s presidential candidate. Gana, who spoke yesterday through the Director General, Professor Jerry Gana Presidential Campaign Team G19, Dr. Ike Neliaku, said he remained the authentic presidential candidate of the party.
