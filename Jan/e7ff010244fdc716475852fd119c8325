Optimism is being sounded by the Federal Government about the possibility of striking lecturers, under the auspices of Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), returning to classroom, this week. The lecturers have been on strike for over two months now, following the inability to reach a deal on their demands with the government. No sooner have the lecturers downed tools, than their colleagues in colleges of education suspended their strike after reaching agreement with the government. Polytechnic lecturers are also on strike. Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu who fielded questions from journalists after a press conference on illegal higher institutions on Friday, said there was a possibility of university lecturers ending their strike soon. He said, “Perhaps, by next week, I hope the ASUU strike will be over.” ASUU President Professor Biodun Ogunyemi had said his colleagues could only return to work after the union struck a deal with the government over its demands. FG and ASUU, please reach a deal FG-ASUU  face-off: Who blinks first? Universities grounded as ASUU embarks on strike
