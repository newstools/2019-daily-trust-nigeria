The Peoples Democratic Party Presidential Campaign Organisation (PDP-PCO) has accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) of instigating violence in Taraba state in order to derail the March 2, governorship poll in the state, and called on President Muhammadu Buhari to call “his men” to order. The Director Media and Publicity of the PDP-PCO, Kola Ologbondiyan, alleged at a press conference in Abuja on Monday, that the APC thugs had while on “shooting spree” in Wukari, a major town in the state recently killed a PDP member in the process and destroyed the party’s campaign materials such as billboards, banners and posters. “Of particular reference are the activities of APC’s governorship candidate in Taraba state, Sani Abubakar Danladi, who has now resorted to violence having realized that there is absolutely no hope for him and his party in the March 2, 2019 governorship election. “It is an incontrovertible fact, known to all, that Taraba state is a long established stronghold of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and that Governor Darius Ishaku has the undiluted backing of overwhelming majority of the electorate across the state, due to his sterling performance in office. “Being exasperated and frustrated by the popularity of the PDP and Gov. Ishaku, the APC, which is stuck with the most unpopular candidate in the election, is bent at triggering confusion and bloodletting so as to ambush and truncate the electoral process in the state, not minding the human and material damage such portends. “The PDP has full information of how the APC is working with enemies of Taraba state to inject confusion and escalate insecurity in the state so that the governorship election will be deferred to enable the federal authorities and security agencies have the opportunity to perpetrate the type of massive rigging that took place in Ekiti and Osun states governorship elections in 2018 and award victory to the APC. “This is the reason APC governorship candidate in Taraba state, Sani Danladi has not signed the peace accord, which was initiated by the Taraba state police command and the INEC to ensure peaceful campaigns and election,” the PPCO said. 2015 Political Events in Retrospective Ishaku, Okorocha, Ikpeazu win Ekiti: How violence may threaten June 21 poll
