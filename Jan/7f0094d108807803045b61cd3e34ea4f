A former Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, has noted that it is high time alternative sources of revenue were developed for the nation, observing that the maritime sector is well positioned to do so. Abubakar, who spoke ahead of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) Maritime Awards, also commended efforts by the Agency to motivate stakeholders and staff. He said this would help them take advantage of the policies in place to invest and grow the economy. ”It is time to develop other alternative sources of revenue for the nation and the maritime sector is well positioned to do so. “What NIMASA is doing in the industry and the Awards are quite in line to motivate stakeholders and staff to take advantage of the policies in place to invest and grow the economy,” General Abubakar said. The Director General of NIMASA, Dr. Dakuku Peterside, disclosed that the successes recorded so far in the maritime sector were as a result of the cooperation of the stakeholders in the industry with the Agency. “As an Agency, we recognise the role of our stakeholders in our drive to realise a robust maritime sector; without the stakeholders, there will be no NIMASA and by extension, no maritime industry. We are therefore hopeful that in the coming years, we will continue to work assiduously to meet the yearnings of the industry,” Dr. Dakuku said. The event which holds tomorrow in Lagos, is expected to attract dignitaries from all walks of life, among who are Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha, who is billed to chair the event, and the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Chibuike Amaechi, the host.
