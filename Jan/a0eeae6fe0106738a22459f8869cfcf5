The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has rejected the N27,000 new National Minimum Wage adopted by the National Council of State on Tuesday. Dr. Peter Ozo-Eson, the NLC General Secretary, made this known to newsmen in Abuja on Tuesday. According to him, the council has no jurisdiction determining another amount after a Tripartite Committee has submitted its report. “It is abysmal of government to be delaying the submission of an Executive Bill to the National Assembly and by wrongfully adopting N27,000 through the Council of States,” he said. Ozo-Eson, however, said the NLC has called an emergency National Executive Council meeting for Friday to weigh on the deadline given to government within which to submit an executive bill to the National Assembly. The NLC general scribe added that the Federal Government was only projecting a shutdown of the economy with its latest action. “This is because workers should not be held responsible for any development after its NEC meeting on Friday,’’ he said. When contacted on phone, NLC President, Ayuba Wabba, said that the NEC  of the Congress would meet over the latest development and issue  an official statement on it. “I’m away in Italy, we will issue an official statement on it,” he said.
