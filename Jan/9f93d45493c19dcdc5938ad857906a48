The National Association of Nigeria Students (NANS) on Monday protested the suspension of the embattled Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen, and urged President Muhammadu Buhari to reverse his decision. The union also described the suspension of Onnoghen as illegal and unconstitutional. The students carried placards with some of the following inscriptions : “Buhari’s suspension of CJN is mockery to our constitution”, “reinstate CJN for free and fair election”, “Buhari, go home you are not fit”, among others. Speaking at the protest in Abeokuta, NANS Spokesman, Adeyemi Azeez, accused the Buhari-led administration of embarking “on judicial coup through the suspension of Onnoghen without following the constitutional procedure.” “Unilaterally and in flagrant violation of the Constitution, he also swore in Tanko Mohammed as the new acting CJN. “By this act, the President has precipitated needless confusion in the polity. A shocking action, it will aggravate tension ahead of the general election in February and March. This poses a great threat to our democracy. “The NANS frowned at the way President Buhari substantiated his action by citing an order from the Code of Conduct Tribunal directing Onnoghen’s suspension; his action is akin to a coup – a judicial coup in this case. “In a subtle way, the President has suspended in part an integral part of the Judiciary arm of government by illegally intimidating its highest figure and shamefully deposing him,” he said.
