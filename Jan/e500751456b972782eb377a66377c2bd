Two people sustained injuries and were rushed to hospital when the podium used by the PDP for the governorship campaign in Jega area of Kebbi State collapsed. The party’s gubernatorial running mate, Alhaji Abubakar Malam, was making his campaign speech when the podium suddenly collapsed with him and several others. The spokesman of PDP in the state, Malam Ibrahim Omie, said nobody sustained serious injury, adding that those with minor injuries had been treated at a nearby hospital. The state chairman of the party, Malam Haruna B. Sa’idu, in a statement, yesterday, said their attention was drawn to “a mischievous and dry video clip orchestrated by the drowning APC and its cohorts” showing the incident. He said what transpired was only an expression of the overwhelming and massive support the PDP and its candidates, especially its gubernatorial flagbearer, Senator Isah Galaudu Augie, enjoyed in the state.
