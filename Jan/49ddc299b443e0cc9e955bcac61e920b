The Senate on Monday cancelled the planned emergency resumption to deliberate on the suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) Walter Onnoghen. Rather, the Senate decided to approach the Supreme Court for an interpretation of the suspension. A statement by Yusuph Olaniyonu, the Special Adviser to Senate President Bukola Saraki on Media and Publicity, confirmed that the Senate filed a suit at the apex court over the matter. “Earlier today, the Senate filed a case in the highest court of the land, the Supreme Court, seeking its interpretation on whether President Muhammadu Buhari acted within the provision of the constitution in his suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Hon. Justice Walter Nkannu Onnoghen or whether the action of the President does amount to usurpation of the powers of the Senate as provided for in Section 292 of the constitution. “Following the filing of the case, the matter of the suspension of the CJN which is the main issue for which the Senate had planned to reconvene tomorrow, has become subjudiced. “Therefore, in line with the standing rules of the Senate not to debate issues that are already pending before the court, the reconvening of the Senate tomorrow has been put off. The previous adjournment of the Senate till February 19, 2019 stays,” the statement said.
