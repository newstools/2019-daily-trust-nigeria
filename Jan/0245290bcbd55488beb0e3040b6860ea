Iran’s foreign ministry has summoned Poland’s highest-ranking diplomatic representative to the country after it was announced that Warsaw would host a summit on Iran in February. Iran’s official IRNA news agency said on Sunday that Tehran conveyed its displeasure to Poland’s Chargé d’Affaires, Wojciech Unolt, over its apparent readiness to co-host the February 13 conference. An unnamed official warned that Tehran would resort to unspecific “counter-action” if the Polish government “did not take urgent compensation measures”. In his Telegram channel, Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi said Unolt was told that “this is a hostile act by the United States against Iran, and Poland is expected to refrain from going along with the US in holding this conference.” On Friday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is on an official visit to the Middle East, told Fox News that the meeting in Poland would “focus on Middle East stability and peace.
