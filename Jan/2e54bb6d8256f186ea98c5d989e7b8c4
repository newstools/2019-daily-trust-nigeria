A presidential candidate under the platform of the African Action Congress (AAC) in the February 16 general elections, Omoyele Sowore, has visited the palace of Ona of Abaji and chairman of the FCT Council of Chiefs, Alhaji Adamu Baba Yunusa, to solicit for the support of the royal father. Sowore, who was at the palace on Saturday, with his campaign train, told the traditional ruler that his visit was to seek for his blessing as he was contesting to be the president of Nigeria. He said the party on which platform he was vying for the presidency was a party of young, desirous and hopeful people that want to change the country in their life time. He further told the traditional ruler that 2019 was the time for the youth to seek elective positions. “Our own time is this time, especially young people. We do not have any reason to believe that there is need for delay for Nigeria to be a fantastic country where everybody can live happily and in harmony,” he said. He added: “There is no excuse for the poverty that is ravaging the country; there is also no excuse for the bad road between Abaji and Abuja or to take a long time to travel; also there is no excuse for us to say our children cannot go to school and for us to be using generators in our homes.” The presidential candidate said he would ensure the economy of the country was improved upon and living wages for workers were also improved on if elected president. “And your highness, one last thing I will say is that when I become president this year, I will invite you as my guest during my inauguration, “ Sowore told the traditional ruler. Responding, the Ona of Abaji commended the presidential candidate for coming to his palace to seek for his royal blessing, and urged him to caution his supporters to conduct themselves peacefully as they embarked on campaign.
