President Muhammadu Buhari has declined assent to the bill seeking to amend the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) Act, alongside four others. ‎The four other bills the president rejected were the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Bill, 2018; Federal Polytechnic Amendment Bill, 2018; Energy Commission Amendment Bill, 2018, and the Maritime Security Operations Coordinating Board Amendment Bill, 2018. The president’s decision was contained in letters read on the Senate floor yesterday by Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu. Buhari said if signed into law, the RMAFC bill would confer to the commission certain powers outside the mandate of the commission. “The bill will confer the powers of oversight of the revenue currently vested in the president and minister of finance to the revenue mobilization, allocation, and fiscal commission and negate the existing provision of section 51 Federal Inland Revenue Services. “The proposed insertion in section 6 (a) of the bill with regards to the removal of earns of generating revenue agencies needs to be harmonized with the various establishment acts of these agencies which contain specific terms and procedures for the removal of chief executive officers.” Buhari rejects Revenue Mobilisation bill, four others RMAFC rejects oil communities fund One sitting to go, 506 bills pending in Senate
