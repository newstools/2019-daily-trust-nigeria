A former Deputy Controller General, Nigeria Prison Service, Mr ‎Shemfe Ekundayo at the weekend  freed five inmates from Kaduna prison to mark his retirement. He said the gesture was to educate the public that they also have a role to play in the rehabilitation and management of offenders. The Deputy Controller, who disclosed this while speaking at his pulling out parade held at Nigeria Prison Service Kaduna after serving for 35 years in the service, thanked God for showing him his retirement day. “As a mark of gratitude to God for 35 years of meritorious service, I paid fine and released five inmates from Kaduna Prison. This gesture is to educate the public that members of the community have a role in offenders’ rehabilitation and management,” he said. He said that the 3000-capacity of prisons, to be built soon would change the face of the prisons to centres of learning and new beginning. “We should all know that prisoners are products of the society and no matter how long they stay in prisons, they will one day return to the society that produced them,” he said. Ekundayo said that the effort of Nigerian Prisons Service in the area of inmates reformation was being acknowledged both locally and internationally. He said recently UNESCO gave an  award to the Nigeria Prison Service in recognition of its work in the rehabilitation of inmates. The retired officer stressed the need for training and retraining of staff which he said was imperative in order to meet the demand of the service’s objectives which are now expanding.
