The Petroleum Equalisation Fund Management Board, PEF(MB) said it has started a project that will help determine the accurate quantity of petroleum products particularly petrol, consumed in the country. The scheme called the sensor monitoring project according to the Fund was done after collaboration with other agencies in the petroleum industry. Executive Secretary of the PEF,  Mr.  Ahmed Bobboi, who said this during a training for journalists in Abuja added that the introduction of the project would solve the problem of conflicting consumption figures given out by various agencies. He said, “Up to today, it is difficult to determine the actual quantity of fuel consumed in this country. Different agencies give you different figures and I think it is not tidy.  With the introduction of the Sensor Monitoring Project,  we believe it would serve to answer all the questions. “The project for the Sensor Monitoring which was approved by the Federal Executive Council was supposed to last for three years. Work has started, some of the equipment we are going to use,  such as the ICT equipment are being produced now; the contractor has already mobilised on site.
