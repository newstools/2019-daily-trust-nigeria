Students of Kingsville School, Abuja, have donated relief materials to Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) at the Durumi IDP Camp. The pupils, who were accompanied by the school’s Vice Principal, Mr. Christopher Istodo, donated items which included bags of rice, cartons of oil, noodles, spaghetti and fruit drinks. Mr. Istodo said the donation was part of the school’s way of teaching students how to relate to the larger society. “Today is one of the days that we come out and donate items contributed by the kids. What they bring is little, but we understand that the heart that they are bringing the items with is more important,” he said. An SSS II student, Okebiorun Temioluwa Grace, urged the government to intervene in bettering the situation of the IDPs through provision of necessary facilities at the camp. Another SSS II student, Ginger-Eke Oluwafemi Franklyn, said, “I pray to God to help them return to their homes. I think government can make this place more conducive for them so that they will feel at home. I wish I could do more to help them.” The Chairman of the Durumi IDP Camp, Malam Ibrahim Ahmadu, commended the school for the support, adding that members of the camp had been surviving on donations.
