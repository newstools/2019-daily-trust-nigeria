A Karmo Grade 1 Area Court in Abuja on Thursday sentenced a 37-year-old security guard, Ezekiel Eze, to three months’ imprisonment for stealing his employer’s property, including aluminum windows. The Judge, Alhaji Inuwa Maiwada, convicted and sentenced Eze following his guilty plea and based on the facts of the case. Maiwada, however, gave Eze an option of N6, 000 fine, and warned him to desist from crime. Eze, who resides on Shabo Road, Karmo, had pleaded for leniency. Earlier, prosecution counsel, Mrs Ijeoma Ukagha, submitted that one Moses Oluwa and a vigilante group attached to Idu-Gbayi, Karmo, arrested and brought Eze to the Karmo Police Station on Dec. 22. Ukagha said that Eze stole four aluminum windows and electric wires from Mr Chima Okeke of House 10, Paradise Estate, Abuja, who employed Eze. The prosecutor said that police investigations revealed that Eze made away with the items without his employer’s consent. She said that the accused made confessional statement during police investigation, adding that the items had been recovered from him. The offence contravenes Section 289 of the Penal Code.
