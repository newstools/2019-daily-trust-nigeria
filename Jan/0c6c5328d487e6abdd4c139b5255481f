The people of Iworoko in Irepodun/Ifelodun local government area of Ekiti state, were again thrown into mourning following the death of their monarch, Oba Michael Oluwafemi Aladejana. This is barely six days after 15 persons were killed in an auto crash caused by a truck laden with bags of branded campaign rice belonging to a senatorial candidate of the APC in Ondo state, Tayo Alasoadura. Aladejana, who was in his 80s died at the early hours of Wednesday at an undisclosed hospital in Ado Ekiti. Alawaroko Obaship title is ranked a second class Oba in Ekiti traditional hierarchical order. News filtered into town at about 8am on Wednesday that the long-reigning monarch had died. When journalists visited the town around 12noon, the traditional rites had already begun with the cutting of the trees and blockage of the dual carriage Ado-Iworoko-Ifaki highway as a way of paying last respect to the departed king. The youths and other age groups also trooped to the streets killing house pets like goats and sheep sighted roaming about as tradition demands. One of the prominent indigenes of the town, who craved anonymity, said the accident which claimed 15 lives and injured four had worsened the health situation of the monarch. “Our monarch was rushed to the hospital after the accident. Though, he had been having health issue before but that incident really made the situation worse for him. “When the news got to the town, he was said to have felt so devastated that his family had to rush him to the hospital early on Sunday. “The sickness was said to have improved on Monday before it relapsed on Tuesday causing his untimely death”, the source said.
