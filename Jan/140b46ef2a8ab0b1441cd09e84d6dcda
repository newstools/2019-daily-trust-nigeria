The People’s Democratic Party Presidential Campaign Organization (PPCO) has described as laughable, alleged plans by the President Muhammadu Buhari government to frame the party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, and arrest him, saying it would be resisted. Addressing a press conference last night in Abuja, the Director Media and Publicity of the PPCO, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, said  Buhari was afraid that Atiku would defeat him in the presidential election, hence the alleged threat. “While we understand that President Buhari and his dysfunctional APC are jittery over Atiku’s soaring popularity ahead of the elections, it is reprehensible that Mr. President will descend abysmally low to fabricate outright lies and falsehood in a bid to discredit a more qualified and acceptable Presidential candidate. “The PPCO makes bold to state that Atiku Abubakar has nothing to do with the alleged issues leading to the collapse of Bank PHB, but an honest and hard working Nigerian who has no skeleton of any sort in his cupboard, unlike President Buhari who is now entangled in series of corruption allegations. “For emphasis, even the Chairman of President Buhari’s Advisory Committee Against Corruption, Prof. Itse Sagay, had since told the world that the Buhari presidency has searched everywhere and could not find anything incriminating on Atiku Abubakar. “The world already knows that this attempt to mudsling our presidential candidate is coming out of President Buhari’s frustration over Atiku Abubakar’s successful outing in the United States, for which the Buhari presidency has gone into full hallucination. “President Buhari should as well, allow an open inquest into the alleged involvement of his relations in the N1.032 trillion alleged corrupt acquisitions in 9Mobile and Keystone Bank PLC.,” the PPCO said. …He lacks moral right to seek re-election - PDP Bury your 2023 presidential ambition, PDP tells Osinbajo Invasion of Atiku's sons' residence dirty politics
