The Senator representing Kwara South Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Dr. Rafiu Adebayo Ibrahim, yesterday, dismissed threats by the All Progressives Congress (APC) to form new government in Kwara State in 2019. He said they were not bothered with antics of the opposition who operated from Lagos. He described opposition figures in the state as “nocturnal politicians who rarely visited home, except when election is around the corner.” The legislator, who is seeking re-election, spoke to journalists on the side-lines of the seventh annual get together of Kwara South wing of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) which was organised in his honour. He said those parading themselves as opposition leaders operated from Lagos, and that they only had transit home in Kwara. Ibrahim stated that the people of the state were wise enough to make informed decision on who to be entrusted with their mandate, and expressed confidence that PDP candidates would be elected in next year’s polls.
