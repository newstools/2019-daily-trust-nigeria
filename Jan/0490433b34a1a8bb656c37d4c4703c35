United States government says it is deeply concerned over the suspension and replacement of Chief Justice of Nigeria without the support of the National Assembly. A statement from the US Embassy in Abuja on Saturday said the decision undercuts the stated determination of the federal government, candidates, and political party leaders to ensure free and fair elections. The statement reads: “The Embassy of the United States is deeply concerned by the impact of the executive branch’s decision to suspend and replace the Chief Justice and head of the judicial branch without the support of the legislative branch on the eve of national and state elections. “We note widespread Nigerian criticism that this decision is unconstitutional and that it undermines the independence of the judicial branch. “That undercuts the stated determination of government, candidates, and political party leaders to ensure that the elections proceed in a way that is free, fair, transparent, and peaceful – leading to a credible result. “We urge that the issues raised by this decision be resolved swiftly and peacefully in accordance with due process, full respect for the rule of law, and the spirit of the Constitution of Nigeria. “Such action is needed urgently now to ensure that this decision does not cast a pall over the electoral process.” Non-declaration of assets: FG arraigns Onnoghen today Judgement-fixing claims that won’t go away Can judiciary be reformed with N70bn budget?
