The multi-billion naira hospital was one of the two commissioned by President Muhammadu Buhari in September last year.

Dr Ganduje expressed delight noting that: “Alhamdulillah, we have started seeing the fruits of the tree we planted. Our intention is to reduce drastically medical tourism to foreign countries. With this kind of successful surgery we will surely achieve our aims.” The governor assured the people of the state that his government would continue to provide best facilities to public hospitals. Ganduje, who also visited the proposed site for modern cancer centre, said government had already awarded a N2.4 billion contract for the project stressing that experts from Australia would arrive Kano next week for the commencement of work.
