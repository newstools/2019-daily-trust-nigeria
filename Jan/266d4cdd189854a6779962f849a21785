Congo’s political standoff deepened on Sunday after the top court backed the contested presidential election victory of Felix Tshisekedi, then his main rival rejected the ruling, called for protests and declared himself leader. As Tshisekedi’s supporters celebrated the ruling in the streets of Democratic Republic of Congo’s capital, runner-up Martin Fayulu said the decision had opened the way to a “constitutional coup d’etat”, raising fears of more violence. In the early hours of Sunday, the Constitutional Court ruled that a legal challenge to the result filed by Fayulu was inadmissible. Fayulu issued statements dismissing the ruling. “The constitutional court has just confirmed that it serves a dictatorial regime…by validating false results,” he said in one. The African Union, which was supposed to send a delegation to the DR Congo on Monday, has now postponed the trip.
