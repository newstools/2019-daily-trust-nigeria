A Ukrainian court has sentenced former president Viktor Yanukovich to 13 years in prison for treason – attempting to quash a 2014 popular uprising. Yanukovich was charged with high treason for asking Russian President Vladimir Putin to send Russian troops to Ukraine after he fled the ex-Soviet country. “Yanukovich committed a crime against the foundation of Ukraine’s national security,” Judge Vladyslav Devyatko said in Kiev’s Obolon district court on Thursday. The 68-year-old had faced up to 15 years in prison but never attended the trial and is believed to be living in Russia after fleeing in 2014. The uprising overthrew Yanukovich and brought to power President Petro Poroshenko, who faces an uphill battle for re-election in March. The authorities beefed up security around the court as judges took turns to read out their ruling.
