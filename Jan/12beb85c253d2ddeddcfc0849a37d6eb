The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has introduced new initiatives to meet the 80 percent financial inclusion target by year 2020, the bank’s Governor Godwin Emefiele has said. The CBN adopted the National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) in 2012. The strategy seeks to drive financial inclusion up to 80 percent by year 2020. A review by ElFina showed that in 2016, 58.4 percent of Nigeria’s 96.4 million adults were financially included comprising 38.3 percent banked, 10.3 percent served by other formal institutions and 9.8 percent served by informal service providers. In 2020,Nigeria plans to have at least 70 percent of its adult population in the formal financial services sector and 10 percent included in the informal sector. Speaking in Abuja at the opening ceremony of the maiden edition of the national financial literacy stakeholders’ conference with the theme ‘Implementing Financial Literacy and Consumer Protection to Advance Financial Inclusion in Nigeria’, the CBN governor said the bank was promoting the new initiatives to positively drive financial inclusion statistics in the near term. Represented at the event by the Deputy Governor, Financial System Stability, Mrs Aisha Ahmad, the CBN boss said key among the initiatives were new regulations and collaboration with the Bankers’ Committee and other relevant stakeholders. “The CBN recently introduced regulations and guidelines for the licensing and operations of Payment Service Banks in furtherance of its efforts to leverage technology to promote financial inclusion and enhance access to financial services for the unbanked and underserved segments of the population. “This is expected to drive down exclusion rates by leveraging wider variety of market participants, leveraging technology and multiple channels to enhance access to deposit products, payments and remittance services to small/micro businesses and low income households,” he said.
