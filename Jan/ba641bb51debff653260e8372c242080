The Osun State’s chairman of the All Progressives Congress Adegboyega Famodun weekend described Osun West senatorial candidate of the party, Engr Adelere Adeyemi Oriolowo as the best for the forthcoming election. Famodun said this while presenting Oriolowo to traditional rulers, people of Iwo, Ede and Irewole Federal constituencies during the “Thank you visit” of Governor Gboyega Oyetola to the constituencies. He said Oriolowo was strategically positioned to fit into the desire of the state to have a well-connected and development-oriented representative whose network with global development agencies could be tapped for the progress of Osun West and the state in general. He stated: “People of the West senatorial district of the state are blessed with APC’s choice of Engr. Oriolowo, I can authoritatively present him to you as the best out of all the political parties have presented for the West in the coming election. “He is a force to reckon with in the field of engineering as a fellow of the Nigeria Society of Engineers, an Associate member of the Nigerian Institute of Institute of chartered Arbitrators, a member of Council for Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria. “I will not want to continue with the list of Oriolowo experience because it is all there for us to all see. Without doubt, we can all come to the conclusion that our candidate is the best man for the job”. Famodun told the gathering. The APC chairman also canvassed for the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari and all the candidates of the party in the state “so that the solid foundation that the party has laid for development can continue.” Fairness demands that Osun West should produce Aregbesola''s successor - Aspirant Why Osun west should produce governor – APC aspirant South West set for new era as progressives take over Osun, Ekiti, other states
