South Africa’s National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has dropped corruption charges against the son of former President Jacob Zuma. Last year, Duduzane Zuma was charged over an allegation that he and his business partners, the Guptas, offered a $43.3m (£33.2m) bribe to ANC MP Mcebisi Jonas with the intention that he would take the job of finance minister. He turned them down. Prosecuting Authority’s Phindi Mjonondwane told reporters that he was not receiving preferential treatment.
