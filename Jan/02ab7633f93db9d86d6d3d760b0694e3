The Action Democratic Party (ADP) Presidential Candidate, Yabagi Sani on Wednesday held a meeting with a former President, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, saying Nigeria’s political power is in the possession of “those who lack knowledge on how to use it.” Sani also lamented that “Nigeria’s economy is at its lowest ebb.” He spoke with newsmen shortly after he met with Obasanjo at his residence inside Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL), in Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta. He expressed dismay over the nation’s insecurity, hunger and what he called lack of capacity and direction, calling for a departure from the present political leadership of the country in the next election. Sani pointed out that Nigeria requires an informed leadership that would take the nation to the promise land. The ADP candidate said Obasanjo during the meeting expressed confidence in his (Sani’s) capacity as Nigeria’s President. “The economy of this country is at its lowest ebb that you can ever think of. This is a country whose GDP was about $570billion just about two or three years ago, growing at five percent rate or more. “And today, for the economy to go down to 1.5 percent growth rate. With all the potentials of this country, believe me, it is not our lot. “God does not want us to suffer hunger, deprivation, killing, lack of capacity in governance, lack of direction. The President cannot keep his own house in order, it’s a shame.  We are laughing stock in the international community. “This is not the promise of this nation. This is not what we have. We have something better. “And that’s why people like us have stepped forward to be given the opportunity to give this country the leadership that it requires, the informed leadership. “A situation whereby you have power but you don’t have the knowledge, it is crisis. That’s what we are in. Power is in the hands of those who do not have the knowledge on how to use that power.”
