The strike embarked upon by members of the Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP) has continued to take its toll on students and academic activities at the Federal Polytechnic, Nekede, Owerri. The union had resumed the suspended strike on December 11, to drive home its members’ 10-point demand. At the Federal Polytechnic, Nekede, the effects of the strike are obvious as both staff and students have deserted the institution. A HND 1, Mass Communication student, Glory Chukwuemeka, who spoke to Daily Trust, shortly after the lecturers downed tools, prayed that the strike should not stretch into the New Year. She said, “We seem to be enjoying it now because it is Christmas period. If it extends to January next year, the effects will be harsh, especially when students would have to be idle from the beginning of the year.” Her concern was shared by another student, Edith Nnadi, who appealed to the Federal Government and ASUP to resolve their differences as soon as possible. One of the staff, who identified himself as Sir Justus Ukaegbu, described the action as a fight to finish. He said, “The issues involved have been lingering and we are not going to budge or give a breathing space until the government does the needful.” When Daily Trust visited the campus, everywhere was empty; even officials of ASUP were not available for comments as their secretariat was under lock and key.
