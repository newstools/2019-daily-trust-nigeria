Some governors now rely on the popularity of President Muhammadu Buhari to win elections, Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa (APC, Zamfara) has said. Marafa said during a press conference at the National Assembly on Tuesday that in the past, presidents relied on state governors to win elections, but that Buhari has demystified that. ‎Marafa was reacting to last Friday’s judgment of a Zamfara State high court, which said the All Progressives Congress (APC), held primaries in the state. ‎”I know part of the gimmick, I know the governor is whipping sentiments that if they don’t accept the judgment, APC would lose the state. But thank God, the president will win Zamfara without Yari. “I know the president is pained with what’s happening in Zamfara, and I’m sure he would want to have a better person in Zamfara even from another party than to have a bad person from APC. The governors now need the president to win, not the other way round. “Of what benefit will APC have the majority in the National Assembly but could not install the leadership? So, it’s the same thing with Zamfara. “I believe the president won’t stand by that kind of sentiment. “Yari wants to use Buhari to win election. He wants to use the security agencies to rig the elections. If I’m lying, let him leave APC and let him leave to go and contest in another platform.” Breaking: I'll remain in APC to fight injustice, support Buhari's 're election -Marafa Marafa pledges to remain in APC, work for Buhari Zamfara 2019: Shinkafi, Marafa, Sani-Jaji obtain APC governorship forms
