About 10 armed men, yesterday, stormed the campaign office of PDP presidential candidate, Abubakar Atiku, in Akure, the Ondo State capital where they assaulted security guards and destroyed posters. The Atiku Campaign Organisation in the state has decried the midnight attack, describing it as barbaric, and fingering members of the opposition APC. A statement issued by the spokesman of the Atiku Campaign Organisation, Ondo State chapter, Mr. Kayode Fasua, said  some hoodlums suspected to be working in favour of the ruling APC attacked the building. “They arrived in the wee hours of the day, at a time the security guards in the Ijapo, Akure area of our office would have closed from duty and descended on our campaign office. “Numbering about 10 and fully armed, they descended on our private security guard, beat him to pulp and then tied him with rope. “After that, they proceeded to dismantling the Atiku billboards and then tearing all his posters. Not done, these agents of the devil went ahead to break window panes and kept shouting ‘where are those documents, where are those documents,’” he said. “But having failed in their evil deed, they retreated, shooting sporadically,” he added. Fasua also said that was not the first time that the massive supporters of Atiku in Ondo State would be assaulted. “But this latest attack is taking the hate politics being perpetrated by those in power to a ridiculous level by attacking the campaign office in its little abode,” he stressed.
