Six people have been killed and 16 injured in a train accident on the Great Belt Bridge in Denmark. Rail network officials said debris from a freight train – possibly a tarpaulin – hit a commuter train during a heavy storm, forcing it to brake suddenly. Rescuers are working to free around 100 passengers who remain trapped on board. The debris struck the commuter train – running from Odense to the capital Copenhagen – at about 07:35 local time (06:35 GMT).
