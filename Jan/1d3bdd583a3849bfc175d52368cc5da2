The gubernatorial candidate of African Democratic Congress (ADC), Senator Abdul-Aziz Nyako, has allayed fears that he may remove the Lamido of Adamawa, Dr Barkindo Aliyu Mustapha, if elected governor in March. The monarch’s removal of Abdul-Aziz and his father, a former governor, retired Admiral Murtala Nyako from their titles of Sarkin Matasa and Sarkin Yamma Adamawa respectively, had fueled speculations that the ADC candidate might dethrone the monarch if he became governor. Nyako made his position known in Yola during a town hall meeting with students, youth groups and associations in the state on Saturday. He promised to give tremendous respect for the traditional institution, saying ‎the misunderstanding with the monarch was in the past and would not be used to witch-hunt anybody. He, therefore, expressed appreciation for the opportunity the Adamawa monarch had given him to serve as Sarkin Matasa which brought him closer to the people at the grassroots. “I am not that vindictive. My interest is not to retaliate; we have enormous problems in Adamawa and my desire is to contribute in solving them. “What transpired between Lamido and I, for me that matter is over. In any case, I wish him well.’ “May I add that this is not political talk, it is true talk from the heart,” Nyako said. Adamawa Guber: Ex Gov.
