A Yoruba   socio-political group has thrown its weight behind the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari in the February 16 presidential election. Yoruba Gbogbogbo, a group which comprised of indigenes of Ondo, Oyo, Ogun, Ekiti, Lagos , part of Kwara, Edo and Kogi states resident in the FCT revealed their stand in a statement yesterday. The statement signed by the Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the association, Alhaji Ibrahim Wale, indicated that the decision was made at a meeting of the executive members held recently in Gwagwalada area council. The group said Buhari’s achievements were deserving of re-election, hence they decided to canvass support for him. “The engagement of 500,000 graduates across Nigeria  through the N- power programme to man previously unmanned classrooms in every local government  area in Nigeria, and also provision of agricultural extension services to farmers are some of his administration’s numerous achievements,” the statement added.
