Mr Olufehinti Olusegun, Director, Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System (IPPIS), has said the Federal Government saved over N206 billion in salaries of federal civil servants during the 2017 and 2018 fiscal years. Olusegun, who made the disclosure in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja, yesterday, said that was achieved through blocking financial leakages of ghost workers. He gave the breakdown as N76 billion in 2017 and N130 billion in 2018, adding that the current administration of President Muhammadu Buhari had helped sustain the policy introduced in 2007. He said the administration, through the offices of the Accountant-General of the Federation and the Minister of Finance, ensured that all the 512 Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and their 740,000 workforce, had been properly streamlined into the IPPIS. He said from 2015 till date, the Federal Government, as part of the gains of the IPPIS, had been able to employ more than 70,000 new workers into the federal civil service. He revealed that the Federal Government had also given the deadline of March for all MDAs to join the IPPIS or have their salaries stopped. “What we have been able to achieve in IPPIS from 2015 till date is due to the political will of the current administration, most especially from the president himself. “He has been able to bring in the Nigeria Police, the NSCDC, immigration and prisons into the IPPIS, unlike what it used to be. In fact we just finished capturing the military. “The kind of support we have enjoyed from the Office of Accountant-General of the Federation, former minister and current minister of finance, has been so tremendous,” he said.
