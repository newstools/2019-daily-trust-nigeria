Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, yesterday, urged political parties to discourage their supporters from carrying weapons to campaign venues, just as he said God has already crowned the next governor of Sokoto State. “So it is not a do or die affair,” Tambuwal said. “We should know that only one person from among us will become the next governor because God has already crowned him; we are just exercising our right as demanded by our constitution,” Tambuwal, who is seeking for a second term on the platform of PDP, said. The governor made the call while speaking on behalf of all the 50 governorship candidates from various political parties in the state that signed a peace accord at a ceremony organised by INEC with the support of the International Republican Institute (IRI). Tambuwal said what Nigerians needed and had been yearning for was peaceful coexistence in the country. “Therefore, we should not add to our problems; we should encourage our youth to drop weapons and to use their voters’ cards to bring the change that they desire, but not attacking each other,” he advised. Also speaking, the co-chairman of National Peace Committee, Bishop Matthew Kukah, said Sokoto had a reputation of being the most peaceful state in the federation and urged political parties and their candidates to ensure the status quo was maintained beyond the election. “I am appealing to you to ensure no life is lost during your campaigns and during the elections. Tell your supporters that election is not a civil war,” he advised. Both the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Abubakar Musa and the Resident Programme Director of IRI, Mr Sentell Barnes, said the signing of the peace accord was a demonstration of commitment by the political parties and their candidates in ensuring peaceful 2019 elections in the state.
