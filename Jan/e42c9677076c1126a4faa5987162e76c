The father of the former Governor of Kano state, Engineer Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso and District Head of Madobi, Alhaji Musa Saleh Kwankwaso has endorsed the re-election bid of Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje. The elderly Kwankwaso assured Ganduje that he would work tirelessly with all his village heads and all community leaders to ensure his victory during the forthcoming the gubernatorial poll. “When you came in after your inauguration on 29th May, 2015, we were absolutely sure that you would bring development to all nooks and crannies of the state. And Alhamdulillah, this is what you are doing. So we need more of this development. “We are ready to support you and get you more closer to the people. We are appreciating the good work you are doing for your people. “We believe in your leadership style as a people-oriented governor, who believes in developing his people in all aspects of life,” he said. In his response, Governor Ganduje said he was in Madobi to seek for fatherly prayers over his re-election bid, adding that, “We are in our home. Here you are with your children. We came to visit our father and get his blessing.” “We are sure you will give us what we are here for. So when you accept to support my gubernatorial race, we are not surprised, because this is just a case of father and his son,” Ganduje added. Governor Ganduje assured the District Head and all village heads and Imams that he would double his commitment when re-elected.
