A group of President Muhammadu Buhari’s supporters under the auspices of HandinHand has on Wednesday stated that, Nigerians can’t and will not make the mistake that will lead to President Muhammadu Buhari’s failure in 2019 general elections adding that, Buhari’s continuity is non-negotiable. Disclosing this at a press briefing in Kano state, the convener HandinHand Buhari support group stated that, it is vividly clear that President Muhammadu Buhari has performed tremendously in improving the economy of the country through agriculture, enhanced transportation network, health and most importantly improved security. “No doubt, the past administration is widely believed to be the worst administration the country has ever witnessed in its 58th years of existence as a nation. The past administration has failed to properly address the social, economic, and security issues of the nation. And now that we God had sent President Buhari, we will not make the mistake of losing him at this crucial moment when Nigeria needed him most,” he said. He added that, there is a need to, in the interest of a better Nigeria, support the candidature of Buhari for a second term.
