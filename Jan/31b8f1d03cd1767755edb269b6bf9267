The FCT Campaign Director General (DG) for the re-election  of President Muhammadu Buhari in 2019, Alhaji Musa Yahaya Muhammad, has boasted that he and other members of the newly constituted campaign council know  how to unseat Sen. Philip Aduda in the February 16, 2019, elections. Alhaji Muhammad, while speaking during an interview with our reporter yesterday in Abuja, claimed that, “I was one of those that contributed to Sen. Philip Aduda’s election into the Senate in those days when I was in PDP; and we know how to unseat him. Yes, we know the formulae, and God willing, we are going to shock him.” He added that, “I assure you, we have six area council chairmen who are all APC and we have the structures on ground.” He said the ruling APC in the FCT had a better candidate who was a two-time local government chairman and also a House of Representatives member, saying the senatorial candidate was a marketable material that would defeat the Sen. Aduda. Muhammad, who is the Chairman of FCT Secondary Education Board (FCT-SEB), said he saw his appointment as the Buhari Campaign Council’ Director General of the FCT as a big responsibility and an opportunity to take the people of the territory to the next level. He said he would work closely with other members of the campaign council to ensure that victory in all elective positions on the platform of the ruling APC in the FCT. He further said the ruling APC had majority of supporters across the FCT because of the sterling performance of the Buhari administration, which he said would earn him block votes. Muhammad, who claimed to have studied Political Science and worked with the National Orientation Agency (NOA), said politics was an easy game for him and that he would bring his experience to bear during the elections.
