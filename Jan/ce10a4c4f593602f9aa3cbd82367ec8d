Members of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Wing were yesterday in the Presidential Villa, Abuja, demanding for a categorical statement from President Muhammadu Buhari regarding where power will shift to in 2023. Their demand came weeks after Vice President Yemi Osinbajo said the South West would produce the president in 2023 if President Buhari wins the forthcoming election. Osinbajo’s assurance was in sharp contrast to that of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, who had on two occasions assured the South East that they would produce the President in 2023, if they support President Buhari’s re-election. The leader of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Wing, Kingsley Dozie Lawrence therefore, appealed to the president to make a categorical statement on the issue of Igbo Presidency in 2023, in addition to initiating a process for the creation of an additional state in the South-East, among others. Responding, Buhari called on Nigerian youths to prepare themselves for political leadership as his generation will eventually quit the scene for the younger ones to take over. He described Nigerian youths as very active and critically important in the Nigerian project. 2019: lgbo groups lobby for Senate President VON DG to Ohaneze: Organise, don't agonise over 2023 Igbo presidency Game of the three wise men
