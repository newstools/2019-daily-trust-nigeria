The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Osun State Command, yesterday disclosed that it has seized 73 bags of Indian hemp in Osogbo in its mop-up exercise ahead of the general elections. The Osun State Commander of the NDLEA, Mr Samuel Egbeola, told Daily Trust that the 73 bags weighing 692.6kg were seized within the Osogbo metropolis on January 23, 2019. Egbeola said the Command embarked on the mop-up exercise to rid the state of illicit drugs as a strategy to nip criminality in the election period in the bud. He said the seizure would go a long way in preventing individuals intending to use illicit drugs to undermine the sanctity of the 2019 general elections from doing so. The NDLEA boss said one male suspect, whose name he didn’t give, was arrested in connection with the seizure and that the suspect was providing useful information on the activities of other illicit drug dealers. Egbeola said, “The mop-up exercise is targeted at dislodging black spots across the state where illicit drugs are likely to be abused, which will in turn ensure a peaceful and secure environment for the conduct of the forthcoming general elections.”
