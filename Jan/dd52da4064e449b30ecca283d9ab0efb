The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) yesterday said that it would commence nationwide mass mobilisation and protests simultaneously nationwide today, and not strike action as widely reported. A statement by the NLC General Secretary, Dr Peter Ozo-Eson said its action plan on the delay in transmitting the recommendations of the Tripartite Committee on a new national minimum wage to the National Assembly by President Muhammadu Buhari was largely misrepresented by some section of the news media as strike action. The NLC scribe recalled that the National Executive Council of NLC met on December 17 last year and directed that the congress holds nationwide mobilisation of workers and its allies if the minimum wage bill was not sent to the National Assembly to be passed as an act of parliament by December 31, 2018. “We immediately announced then that on January 8, 2019, there will be a nationwide mass mobilisation and protests simultaneously across all states in Nigeria. This does not translate to a strike. “It is on record that each time we had cause to embark on a national strike, we say so publicly without any equivocation. We still don’t understand where the story about a strike commencing tomorrow came from,” he said. Ozo-Eson said that, already, all NLC state councils, affiliate unions and allies in civil society organisations have been fully mobilised to ensure the success of today`s mass protests in all the states and the Federal Capital Territory. He said when a date is decided for the commencement of a strike, Nigerians will be appropriately informed. ...Minimum wage: Labour begins nationwide strike January 8 Minimum Wage: Labour begins warning strike Wednesday, Sept. 26 midnight Labour begins strike action tomorrow
