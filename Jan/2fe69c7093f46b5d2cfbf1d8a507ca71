Members of a Buhari support group, Presidential Support Committee (PSC) for Buhari/Osinbajo 2019, were in Abaji, yesterday, soliciting for support from residents for the re-election of the president. The FCT Coordinator of the PSC for Buhari/Osinbajo 2019, Alhaji Musa Mohammed, said he decided to lead members of the group to visit the council chairman to discuss arrangements on how to mobilise support across the council for the re-election of Buhari in next month’s presidential election. He told the chairman that the members of the committee also wanted to ensure that four people were selected in each polling unit across the council that would work at the grassroots level for the victory of the party. The Chairman of Abaji Area Council, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, while responding, assured that he would work to ensure that President Muhammadu Buhari wins the election in the area with a wide margin. He said the people of the council had since 2003 given their bloc votes to Buhari and were ready to do same in the forthcoming election. The chairman commended the members of the presidential support committee for their role in dousing tension over the primaries among some of the aggrieved aspirants across the FCT, saying the personality of Buhari and some few other stakeholders had saved APC from facing serious crisis. “In fact, what APC passed through, but for the personality of Buhari, the party would have been taken over by series of crises. So we thank God with your efforts and the reconciliation committee, the dust is gradually going down,” he said.
