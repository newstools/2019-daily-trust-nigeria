The National Working Committee of Peoples Democratic Party, PDP- backed gubernatorial candidate in Ogun State, Ladi Adebutu on Sunday disclosed that 50,000 canvassers have been recruited who would engage in door to door campaign for the party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar as well as the governorship election in the state. Adebutu equally met with about 250 political groups who have identified with Atiku’s candidacy ahead of February elections. Speaking at the meeting held at Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, the Reps member disclosed that the PDP had assembled at least 20 stalwarts who would man each polling booth across the state to guard against rigging in all the elections. Adebutu, who is currently battling Senator Buruji Kashamu, in court, over the party’s gubernatorial ticket, described the ruling APC as a failure, urging Nigerians to return PDP to power for the progress and development of the country. He accused the INEC of “deliberately creating confusion in the Ogun PDP in an attempt to cause vote suppression in the state.” Adebutu said “No matter what INEC does. No matter what APC does, the will of the people must stand. We shall stand strongly. We have decided to manage and man every single polling booth. “We have to, as a nation, stand up to defend our votes. APC government has failed. APC must go. Atiku must win.” 2019: Bankole, Odebiyi, Adebutu, others jostle to replace Amosun 9 states with most dramatic governorship primaries Ogun guber: Court didn't declare anyone PDP guber candidate – Kashamu
