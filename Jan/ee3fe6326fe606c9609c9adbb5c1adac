Germany said on Wednesday it was pushing for a solution to disputes over the distribution of migrants rescued at sea so Europe’s naval security mission can continue beyond March. The European Union launched “Operation Sophia” in 2015 to counter migrant smugglers in the Mediterranean and reduce arrivals. But its future is uncertain given Italy’s insistence that those rescued be distributed among EU countries instead of being brought mostly to Italian ports. With management of the migrant crisis damaging unity in the 28-nation bloc, the EU in December extended the Rome-based mission by three months to give time for a solution. But EU sources say that will be tough.
