The National Council of Women Societies (NCWS) has urged women to vote candidates with policies that will improve the living standard of women and youth in 2019. The president of the council, Mrs. Gloria Laraba Shoda, said this in her New Year message to Nigerian women. “As we enter into the election year, I advise all Nigerian women to be actively involved in election processes. It is time we stand up to defend our rights as women,” she said. “Our future and that of our families is in our hands, so, we must all come out to exercise our rights and vote candidates that will support the course of women,” she said.
