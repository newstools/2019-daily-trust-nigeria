Akwa Ibom elders under the aegis of Akwa Ibom Leaders Vanguard are demanding for the resignation of President Muhammadu Buhari over the suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Walter Onnoghen. The group is also demanding that the National Assembly intervened in the matter and ensure that the rule of law as enshrined in the nation’s constitution on the matter was defended. Spokesman of the group, Senator Anietie Okon, said yesterday, in Uyo that the action of the president was deliberately designed to stir the country into crisis, adding that he was being misguided by a cabal that wants to plunge the nation into anarchy. He demanded the immediate withdrawal of the suspension which, he said, was designed to demean the status of Onnoghen, noting that the people of the Niger Delta region would resist the disgraceful act on their son. He called on President Buhari to tender an unreserved apology to Justice Onnoghen, the judiciary and the entire citizens of the country for what he described as a misdemeanor.
