The Bank of Industry (BOI) has said that of the loans given in the last five years in Nigeria, less than 1 per cent went to over 37 million Nigerians at the bottom of the pyramid. Addressing journalists on Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP), which part of Federal Government’s Social Protection Programme, the BOI’s Executive Director in charge of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), Toyin Adeniyi, said 1.5 million Nigerians have received loans under the GEEP. GEEP is implemented through three key products: MarketMoni, TraderMoni and FarmerMoni. She said GEEP has two primary goals: access to finance and financial inclusion, both of which are recording successes. On financial inclusion, Adeniyi said 1.3 million Nigerians have entered into the formal financial system as new operator of bank accounts or mobile wallets. “All GEEP loans are interest-free and there are stringent collateral requirements. GEEP are available to all Nigerians who qualify for the various products,” she said. 7000 benefits from marketmoni loans in Ogun Uncertainty over GEEP loans worries MSME operators Vote buying: BOI disagrees with Obasanjo, Transparency International on TraderMoni
