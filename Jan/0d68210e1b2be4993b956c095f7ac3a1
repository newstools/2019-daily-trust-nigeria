The governorship candidate of the All Progressive Congress, APC in Cross River State, Senator John Owan-Enoh has stressed that, for the state to be relevant in the national scheme of things, it must vote for President Muhammadu Buhari to return to power. He said Cross River State was not well regarded even in the South-South region of the country but treated as a very junior partner. He warned that it would be more dangerous for the state in the next dispensation to continue to be in the opposition party, which reason he would want the people to consolidate and elect him on the APC platform. He said, though ruled by PDP, President Buhari had shown the state much favours by giving, at least, seven key and influential federal appointments to its citizens in his first term. He stated that Buhari had executed and commissioned many important federal projects which were already, impacting the people all over the country.
