Constituents and supporters of Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara,  have kicked against an alleged plan by INEC to relocate a collation centre ahead of the forthcoming elections. The protesters from Bogoro, Dass and Tafawa Balewa, the speaker’s constituency, alleged that INEC wanted to relocate the said collation centre from Zwall in Tafawa Balewa Local Government Area to Dass. They presented a protest letter at the INEC office in Bauchi, yesterday, on behalf of the coalition of political parties contesting for Dass, Tafawa Balewa Bogoro constituency. Speaking, Bauchi South PDP Zonal chairman, Isa Babayo Tilde, said they wanted INEC to sustain the status quo by not relocating the center from Zwall to Dass in the interest of peace, justice and fairness. He said the federal constituency was established for the three local government areas of Dass, Tafawa Balewa and Bogoro in 1979. Receiving the petition on behalf of the INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner, the Head of Public Enlightenment and Public Affairs, Mohammed Yahaya Salihu, said the commission would look into their complaint. Salihu said the electoral body would be fair to all according to the laws guiding its operations.
