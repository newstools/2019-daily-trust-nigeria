Outgoing Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, has advised his successor to go around the country and adopt measures that would enhance security. Speaking after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari together with his successor, he said, “I want to inform Nigerians that today I am 60 years and I think I have reached the pinnacle of my career. “So I am going to handover to my successor, the incoming Inspector General of Police. He is an officer I know very well. We knew each other in the past, we have worked together and I wish him success.  Advice to Adamu “The advice I will give is that just like in our time, he should try to go round the country and adopt measures to ensure that the Nigeria Police Force give maximum protection to lives and property, ” he said.  Major challenges “I think so far under this government, I think the Nigeria Police Force has been making a lot of effort  to secure Nigerians. Obviously, there are challenges in the area of recruitment; of course you are aware that the government has just given us approval to recruit more people yearly. By the grace of God, by this year the number of police officers is going to increase considerably.”  Preparation for election “Obviously, we are adequately prepared for the elections. We have carried out a lot of elections in this country and I think you will agree with me that the Nigeria Police Force tried in these elections. I am assuring Nigerians that the Nigeria Police Force is going to do its best in this coming elections.” Idris leaves, hands over to new IGP Adamu Police haven’t forgotten Alakyo, Gwoza - IGP Police recruitment, posting now based on LGs per state - IGP
