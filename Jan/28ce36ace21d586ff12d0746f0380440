Gunmen, last night, attacked Yar Santa village in Kankara local government area of Katsina State, killing four people and injuring many others. The gunmen attacked the village at about 6pm when most of its residence were returning from a neighbouring market at Kankara town. Sources say the bandits, on motorcycles, shot sporadically as villagers ran for safety. Many people are still missing following the attack. “This morning, as we were doing the funeral rites of the deceased, the bandits came again and it took the intervention of the vigilante group to neutralise the attack,” he said. When contacted, the spokesman of the state police command, SP Gambo Isah, promised to make enquires and get across but he has not responded at the time of filing this report.
