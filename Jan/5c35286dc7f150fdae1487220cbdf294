A Karmo Grade 1 Area Court, Abuja, on Thursday discharged a 32-year-old man, Danladi Ali, of constituting public nuisance, after he pleaded guilty. Ali, pleaded guilty to a four-count charge of constituting public nuisance, resistance of arrest, assault on police officer and mischief. He, however, begged the court for leniency. “I plead with this court to reduce my punishment for I know I am guilty of all the allegations. “I will suffer so much if you send me to jail; I am so sorry for what I did; please sir forgive me, I will not smoke again,’’ he pleaded. The judge, Alhaji Inuwa Maiwada, after listening to the plea of Ali for mercy, warned and discharged him of all charges. “You are a first time offender and had begged the court for mercy, you are discharged of the offences, but must be of good behaviour,’’ he said. Maiwada however ordered Ali to sign a bond to be of good behaviour and to desist from committing crime. Earlier, the prosecuting counsel, Mrs Ijeoma Ukagha, had told the court that a team of police officers on patrol at Utako, Abuja, led by Insp. Abah Gabriel, on Jan. 3 arrested Ali. “The accused was arrested at Utako smoking dry leaves suspected to be Indian hemp, he resisted arrest and assaulted one of the police officers,’’ Ukagha said. He said that Ali confessed to the crime during police investigation. According to the prosecutor, the offences contravened the provisions of Section 198, 172, 267 and 326 of the Penal Code. (NAN)
