An Ogba Chief Magistrate Court at the weekend ordered that a church usher with a Pentecostal church, Saviour Udoh, be remanded for allegedly defiling a five-year-old girl. Police said that the incident happened at a parish of the Redeemed Christian Church located at Oshifila Street, Anifowoshe Ikeja, Lagos. Police said that the victim’s mother had allegedly taken her daughter for prayer and protection. The prosecutor, Supol E Ayorinde, alleged that the mother of the girl kept her in the church before she went to work with the intention that she would be safe. The Prosecutor told the court that when the girl’s mother came to pick her daughter, she met Udoh with the victim where they were sleeping and covered themselves with clothes. “When the woman took her daughter home she found out that her daughter was busy putting her hand inside her private part. From close examination, she discovered that substance suspected to be sperm was dropping from the girl’s private part prompting her to suspect the accused”, he said. “The matter was reported at MAN Centre Police Station and Udoh was arrested. The matter was later transferred to the Gender Section of the State Command for further investigations” the Prosecuror added. The court however refused the plea of the accused to be granted bail as the prosecutor informed the court that it was a case of defilement which was a capital offence and needed DPP advice. Thus, the Presiding Magistrate, Mrs. B.O .Osunsanmi, ordered him to be remanded in prison without an option of bail. The court also directed the prosecutor to send a duplicate copy of the file to the Department of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for advice. The matter was adjourned till February 6, 2019 when the court expected the DPP report to be available.
