The spiritual leader of Brotherhood of the Cross and Star, His Holiness Olumba Olumba Obu, has declared that the forthcoming presidential and governorship elections will restore peace in Nigeria. In his New Year message he delivered at his headquarters in Calabar, the renowned spiritual leader said not all the flag bearers of the different political parties would eventually emerge leaders of the country at the general elections but those already spiritually selected. He called on Nigerians to live in peace, forgive themselves, care for themselves and persist in doing good only, so that goodness would be the lot of the country. He warned against further killings in the country and political violence as the year 2019 sets in, saying immediate recompense would frequently be the lot of many. Obu said: “The general elections in Nigeria holding from next month hold surprises and will shock Nigerians and the entire world. But the children of God have no need to panic. God the Father has restored peace all over Nigeria.” 2019 general elections will shock the world, says Olumba New leaders already selected in spiritual realm – Cleric BAYA 2014: Olumba Obu wants youths to champion Nigeria, World peace
