Hearing will continue on February 4, 2019 at an Ogba chief magistrate court, Lagos, in a defilement case against a 31-year-old man, Musa Agbaje, who the police accused of inserting his fingers in the private part of his neighbours’ two under-aged daughters. Agbaje is facing a two-count charge of attempted rape and defilement and may face a minimum of six years in prison if found guilty. The police said Agbaje was arrested after he allegedly lured two of his neighbours’ daughters aged five and six years old to his room and inserted his fingers into their private part. According to the police, the accused admitted at the police station that having realised that the size of his manhood would not allow him to achieve penetration in the little girls, he chose to insert his fingers into their private part to satisfy his sexual desire. The police added that as the accused was attempting to satisfy his desire, the little girls raised an alarm, which attracted adult neighbours. The girls then narrated to the adults what the accused had been doing with them. Policemen were then invited and Agbaje was arrested and detained at the station for interrogation over the defilement allegation. He was later charged with sexual assault on the girls. Agbaje, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The prosecutor, Inspector Benson Emerhi, did not oppose his bail but asked the court for a date for hearing. Thus, the presiding magistrate, Mrs O. Sule-Amzat, granted him bail in the sum of N50,000, with two sureties in like sum. Agbaje would, however, be in prison custody pending when he will perfect the bail conditions.
