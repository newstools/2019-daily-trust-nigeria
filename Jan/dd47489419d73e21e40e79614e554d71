Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said national  unity is the best tribute for fallen heroes who died defending the territorial integrity of Nigeria. He spoke yesterday in Abuja during the interdenominational Church service for 2019 Armed Forces Remembrance Day. He said, “Our unity and peaceful coexistence is the best tribute to our fallen heroes. “Our posthumous thanks to them and their families who not only   bore   the fearful apprehension of their going to war but also the heart break of their deaths. “Also important is to ensure that they did not die in vain. “This unity and territorial integrity of the nation for which they died must not be jeopardized by the reckless utterances and actions which play on the religious and ethnic fault lines of our nation. “Our gratitude must also mean a commitment to ensuring that their families are cared for, that their children do not ask why the sacrifices they made were made at all.” He noted that, “ in these battles we have been sharply reminded that indeed “freedom is not free; that peace is often paid for with blood and gore.” Army buries fallen heroes Armed Forces Remembrance Day: Soldier’s insurance scheme increases death benefit-Ihejirika Buratai weeps as military buries fallen heroes
