The PDP in Udung Uko Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State has lost over 450 members to the APC. The defectors joined the APC yesterday during a visit to the APC Campaign Office along Four Lanes in Uyo. They were led by Mr Obiosio Obisio, the PDP Udung Uko Local Government chapter Youth Leader, Messrs Peter Effanga and Sam Effiong, two other members of the chapter executive and Ulap Nyong Edumoh, the proprietor of St. Dominic Comprehensive College, a popular school in Oron Local Government Area. Mr Obiosio said with their coming APC would win all the elections in Udung Uko, one of the five local government areas in Oron Nation, the third largest ethnic group in Akwa Ibom State. Ulap Edumoh said they were moved to join APC because of the impact Obong Nsima Ekere, the APC governorship candidate created in Oron Nation with road construction as Managing Director of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). Dr Amadu Attai, the APC deputy governorshipcandidate who represented Obong Ekere, said the defection was earlier scheduled for the APC campaign visit to Udung Uko in a few weeks time but had to be brought forward because of the insistence of the defectors that they could not wait that long. Receiving the defectors on behalf of the State APC Chairman, Dr Ita Udosen, the APC State Deputy Chairman, hailed them for seeing the light and assured them of proper integration into APC and equal opportunities in the party with old members.
