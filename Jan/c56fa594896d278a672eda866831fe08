The Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP)  candidate in Edo South Senatorial district, Sen. Matthew Urhoghide, has urged the people of the district to support his  re-election  into the National Assembly in order to attract more development to the area. Sen Urhoghide made the call at the weekend in Benin City during party’s campaign rally at Idogbo, the administrative headquarters of Ikpoba-Okha Local Government of the state. According to him, the people should ignore vote buyers and elect PDP candidates in the 2019 general elections as well as defend their mandate to secure a future for themselves and their children. On his part, the party’s state chairman, Dan Orbih, said only PDP elected legislators have attracted federal government  projects to Edo in last three years. While urging the people not to  vote for legislators who sold their mandate, he said APC brought suffering, hunger, unemployment, herdsmen menace, vote buying among others in the country. According to him, the people should vote for Atiku as he  is the solution to get Nigeria working again.
