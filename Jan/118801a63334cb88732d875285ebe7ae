Three suspects have been arraigned at the Magistrate Court II in Bauchi for allegedly vandalising properties at the campaign office of New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) governorship candidate in the state, Ambassador Shu’aibu Ahmed Adamu. The accused persons, Bashir Ahmed, Imrana Abubakar and Elisha Andrew, according to the police First Information Report (FIR) presented to the court by Sergeant Lano Salihu, committed the offence in the early hours of December 31, 2018‎. According to the report, the suspects arrived at the scene in an unmarked vehicle painted in the colours of another political party. The police prosecutor said the suspects destroyed billboards of the NNPP candidate and broke glasses at the front of the campaign office located at Bauchi GRA and later abandoned the vehicle at the scene. He told the court that the damage done by the suspects was valued at N250,000. He said the offence was contrary to sections 96 and 327 of the penal code. The prosecutor therefore urged the court to compel the accused to pay for the properties‎ they destroyed at the NNPP candidate’s campaign secretariat. After hearing the police FIR, the three suspects pleaded not guilty. The prosecutor also urged the court to order the Divisional Police Officer (DPO)‎,GRA Police Station to transfer the custody of the vehicle allegedly used in committing the crime by the suspects. Lawyer to the accused, Barr. Abubakar Sadiq Idris, applied for the bail of ‎the three accused persons and objected to the transfer of the vehicle as it had not been tendered as evidence. The presiding magistrate, Amina Garba, ordered the vehicle to remain in police ‎custody until it was tendered as evidence. She, however, denied the accused lawyer’s application for bail and adjourned the case to January 15 for hearing‎.
