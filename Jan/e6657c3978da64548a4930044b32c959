Former Secretary to the Federal Government (SGF), Babachir David Lawal, has predicted loss of Adamawa State to the opposition if Governor Muhammadu Jibrilla is retained as the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Speaking in Yola at a press conference organised by the governorship  campaign team of President Buhari’s brother-in-law, Mahmud Halilu who lost out in the last APC primary election, Babachir said the fact that the governor had been in court  over alleged WAEC certificate forgery showed that the  state could slip away. He stressed the need for the party to replace Jibrilla with a credible candidate who possessed the minimum qualification or risk losing the state through litigation. “APC as a party is confronted with possibility of presenting candidate per adventure that may lose governorship election over certificate disqualification. Those people that alerted us on the certificate saga are not members of APC,” Babachir said. “We went to court to ensure that APC retains Adamawa State and to prove to Nigerians that we have confidence in the  judiciary,” he added. Earlier, Mahmud Halilu accused the state government under Jibrilla of failure to improve the lives of Adamawa people “despite huge unjustified borrowings and in the last four years.”
