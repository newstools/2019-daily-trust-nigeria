The Ekiti State governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, has said that a home-grown school feeding programme, tagged ‘Ekiti Kete Meals’ will commence in the state this month. Fayemi, who gave the assurance at a training workshop for food vendors that would be used for the feeding programme, assured that the programme, which he said was designed to improve pupils’ dietary status, increase school enrolment and provide employment opportunities for youths and farmers in the state, had been well planned and would be well executed. Represented at the occasion by his Chief of Staff, Hon Biodun Omoleye, the governor reiterated his commitment to improving the living standard of the people of the state. He advised the food vendors to do the job assigned them diligently. “It is hoped that you, our esteemed food vendors, will do your work with integrity and will not betray the confidence reposed in you by the government that appointed you to serve in this capacity. “Be assured that your positive contributions towards the programme will go a long way in rebranding and bringing more benefits to our loving state and our children who are leaders of tomorrow,” he said. Gov Fayemi revealed that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo would be visiting the state before the end of the week to launch the Traders Money scheme.
