The Senate on Thursday passed for second reading the National Minimum Wage Bill, 2019. Senators, who had to suspend their rules to pass the bill for first and second readings, said they were committed to the expeditious passage of the bill. A total of 11 senators who spoke during the debate on the bill all supported the passage of the bill. Most of the senators said the N27,000 proposed was small, while others expressed fears that some state governments might not be able to pay. The Senate, after the second reading of the bill, raised an adhoc panel to work on the bill and report back in two weeks. The committee is headed by Senate Chief Whip, Sola Adeyeye, with seven others as members. Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, who presided over the plenary, said against some reports that the minimum wage for federal workers would be N30,000, while that of state governments workers would be N27,000, the amount proposed by the government across board is N27,000. Our correspondent reports that although the national minimum wage would be N27,000, the federal government said it could afford to pay N30,000.
