The Federal Government has approved the acquisition of 20 aircraft for the Nigeria College of Aviation Technology (NCAT), Zaria to improve training and development of young pilots. Daily Trust reports that the DA 40 aircraft used by flying schools worldwide costs $420,000 per unit. The Rector/CEO of the college, Capt. Muhammad Abdulsalam, disclosed this in a chat with aviation correspondents in Zaria but explained that the aircraft would be bought in phases. He also said the college has almost concluded the installation of its Boeing 737 simulator to be located in Zaria. He said currently, “the approval we have from the government is to acquire 20 Diamond aircraft; five of which are the two-engine DA42 and 15 Assembly engine DA 40 aircraft. When I assumed office in 2017, we took delivery of one DA 42 aircraft in April of 2017.” He disclosed however that an order was placed for more aircraft but the supply was stalled because the Diamond manufacturer was bought by another company which relocated the production line from Austria to Canada. On the simulator, he said apart from the B737, another simulator is being installed for firemen and would serve fire-fighters across the country and save the nation huge foreign exchange. “The simulator has been constructed, but it is there waiting for shipment; it is too big to enter a container. If they bring it in the container, they won’t be able to cover it. And if they bring it in and the building is not ready, it would be exposed to the elements that is why the manufacturer advised us not to expose it but wait until the building is ready. “This simulator is very sensitive to temperature and humidity and all the parts were made by Boeing. We believe that the stimulator would be installed this year,” he stated. “In addition, we also have another simulator that is being installed in Zaria this year. The simulator is for firemen. It is an automatic fire simulator. As you may be aware, we have never had a fire simulator in Nigeria in spite of the number of firemen that we have in the country. All these years we have been sending our firemen to Cameroon for training,” he revealed.
