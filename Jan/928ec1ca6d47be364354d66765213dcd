The Chairman of Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), Abdullahi Adamu Candido, has warned community leaders and schools’ authorities to desist from using primary schools in the council for social or religious gatherings. Candido made this known when he inspected the construction of perimeter fence and security post at LEA Primary School, Unguwar Hakimi, Orozo, while on a two-day tour of completed projects across the wards in the area council. He said any teacher caught in the act of renting school facilities to social groups or religious organisations would not be spared. “Our schools are not meant for social and religious gatherings, whichever community that wishes to organise such an event should find an event centre or garden around them. “Never again in AMAC should we have schools being used as meeting points for social or religious activities. Because at the end of the day it is the pupils that suffer,” he said. He said the ban became necessary to curb vandalism of school facilities which he said was usually at the peril of the pupils and government. He said he was passionate about education, adding that should he be given another three-year mandate, he would put in place the AMAC School for the Gifted. “God’s willing if we have the mandate of the people again to start another three-year mandate, it is enough for me to construct AMAC School for the Gifted and it will be achieved in just one year so that the remaining two years will be used to stabilise the school,” he said.
