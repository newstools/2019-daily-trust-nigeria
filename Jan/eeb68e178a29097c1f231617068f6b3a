The PDP Presidential Campaign Organisation (PPCO), yesterday, said its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, is set to fight corruption and create wealth for ordinary Nigerians if elected next month. The Director, Media and Publicity of PPCO who doubles as the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, said in a statement that Atiku would within the first 100 days in office launch a comprehensive national anti-corruption strategy. “This will be a clear departure from President Muhammadu Buhari’s bogus anti-corruption fight which serves only as a smokescreen for his cronies and relations to fritter trillions of naira from the public treasury, while hounding opposition members with trumped-up corruption charges,” he claimed. According to him, “The Buhari presidency has failed to secure any conviction in the fight against corruption because it is shielding corrupt persons, particularly close relations of Mr. President and indicted APC leaders while Nigerians suffer hardship because of their atrocities. “If Atiku Abubakar is elected president, it will no longer be ‘business as usual’ as his templates will directly restore the independence of all anti-corruption institutions as well as block all loopholes through which public funds can be siphoned,” he said. “In the same vein, due process mechanism will be restored and as a complete departure from the past, the National Procurement Council will be inaugurated within the first 100 days in office in accordance with the provisions of the Bureau for Public Procurement, Act,” he added. …He lacks moral right to seek re-election - PDP PDP drags Oshiomhole to Abdulsalami peace c'ttee APC, PDP trade words over CJN
