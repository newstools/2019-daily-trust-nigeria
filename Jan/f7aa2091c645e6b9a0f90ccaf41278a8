The Private sector must play active roles and drive growth of West African economies through deeper economic integration in the region. Speaking at the 6th Annual General Meeting of the Federation of West African Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FEWACCI), the President of the regional Chamber, Mr Essohouna Germaine Meba, said the business community should work together to ensure deepening of regional integration within ECOWAS member states. This year’s meeting has its theme as “Private Sector and Deepening Regional Integration in ECOWAS Member States.” Meba said the meeting would provide members opportunity to discuss regional and continental economic integration. The National President of the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA), Iyalode Alaba Lawson, drew a connection between economic prosperity of citizens and economic competiveness. “Our main gaol is the constant improvement of the competiveness of the economy of West Africa as this accelerates the quality of life of individual citizens,” she said. She said the regional chamber is a melting pot of business people and an avenue for the incubation of business ideas and trends in the West African region. “By presenting the investment potential of West Africa in the countries of the region and beyond, we detect potential business partners for our members,” she said.
