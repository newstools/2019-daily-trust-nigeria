Over 1,000 members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have joined the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Tambuwal local government area of Sokoto state. Tambuwal is the hometown of the incumbent Governor of the state, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal. Among the defectors were the local government chairman of the Nigeria Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), Alhaji Salisu Mode and that of Trailers Union, Bello Musa as well as the Tambuwal/Shihiri ward chairman of PDP. They announced their defection at the governorship and presidential campaign of APC at the Tambuwal township stadium on Tuesday. In his remarks, the immediate past Commissioner of Agriculture, Alhaji Nagwari Tambuwal and the chairman of APC in the area, Alhaji Umaru Maitasiru promised bulk vote for the party in the forthcoming elections. Nagwari donated nine campaign vehicles and 11 motorcycles to the APC. Overwhelmed by the mammoth crowd that received them, the gubernatorial candidate of APC, Alhaji Ahmed Aliyu urged PDP and its members to keep off Tambuwal as it was for APC. “When they come for your votes ask them which project have they executed in your area. Even the School of Nursing that was started by his (Tambuwal) predecessor in Tambuwal, they could not finish it,” he said.
