Former president Olusegun Obasanjo on Sunday described as “outrightly idiotic” the Federal Government’s Tradermoni scheme being spearheaded by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. TraderMoni is a loan programme of the Federal Government, created specifically for petty traders and artisans across Nigeria. Obasanjo spoke at his Pent House Residence at Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta, Ogun State. Obasanjo expressed regret over Osinbajo’s defence of the much-criticised scheme, calling it shallow and lopsided. “What an act by a Senior Advocate of Nigeria lawyer, number 2 man in the Executive hierarchy; and what is more, a pastor of one of the Christian movements led by a revered, respected and upright church leader, Pastor E.A Adeboye.” “Osinbajo must have gone for, “if you can’t beat them, join them”. A great pity indeed and which makes people ask the questions, “any hope”? Yes, for me, there is hope. Osinbajo has shown the human weakness and proved the saying that the corruption of the best is the worst form of corruption.” “His explanation that it was their government’s programme can only be construed to be very shallow and lopsided, if not an outrightly idiotic programme.” FG launches TraderMoni in 3 more Lagos markets Hope Party drags INEC, APC to court over “tradermoni” scheme Hope party sues INEC, APC over tradermoni
