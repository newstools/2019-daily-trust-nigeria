The Lagos State governor, Mr Akinwunmi Ambode, has assured residents of the state that the government would deliver more life-changing projects in 2019 for more benefits to them. Governor Ambode, at the grand finale of the 2018 One Lagos Fiesta (OLF) held at the Eko Atlantic City, Victoria Island, on Tuesday, said that irrespective of the fact that 2019 is an election year, the state would witness more prosperity as the enabling environment for the economy to thrive had already been firmly established. “I believe the gross domestic product of Lagos will grow, and I believe irrespective of what is happening, Lagos remains the most prosperous state in Nigeria. And that can only get better,” the governor said. “The positive economic impact of the fiesta is very visible. At the beginning, we were doing this particular fiesta in just one location, but now we have been able to increase it to five locations, eight days and 40 concerts. One can only imagine everything surrounding the initiative in terms of employment, job opportunities for food hawkers, artisans, and above all, the security that has kept the city very safe. “We are excited that this is part of the GDP that we are growing for Lagos State, and I know that this will be continued by the next government. I am satisfied that we made a promise that we were going to use tourism, entertainment, arts and sports to promote excellence in Lagos and almost four years after, people can see that we have fulfilled it and Lagos is the only destination for people every December,” he said.
