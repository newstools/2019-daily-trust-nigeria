Former Scottish First Minister and pro-independence figurehead Alex Salmond has appeared in court, charged with attempted rape and sexual assault. Police Scotland confirmed earlier on Thursday that a 64-year-old man had been arrested and charged. He was charged with two counts of attempted rape and nine counts of sexual assault, the Scottish prosecutor’s office said. Outside the court in the Scottish city of Edinburgh, Salmond denied committing any crime. “I am innocent of any criminality whatsoever,” he said.
