The Managing Director of Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC) Engr. Fidet Okhiria, has said the Lagos – Abeokuta axis of the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge rail would be completed in the next 10 days. He disclosed this on Wednesday during the routine inspection of the project as the Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi was absent. No reason was given for his absence. The minister had earlier said the Lagos-Abeokuta end from Iju would be completed in the first week of January to enable the Vice-President and some ministers take a train ride. But it was learnt that the laying of tracks from Iju to Ijoko stalled the completion of the project. Addressing newsmen after the inspection, Okhiria disclosed that 1.45km of tracks are being laid on a daily basis. He explained that Iju-Ijoko which is 11 km distance would be connected to Kajola in Ogun state where tracks have been laid up to Abeokuta to ensure that train ride takes place. He said, “The formation is ready, where they are supposed to put the sea coach, they put the sea coach; where they are supposed to put stone dust, they put stone dust and after the track, they will put the ballast. “Before the 4th or 6th of February, we move from Iju to Abeokuta”. However, at Kajola where train can drive to Abeokuta, the MD said he was impressed, appealing to Nigerians to protect the trains after completion of the railway. “If you don’t maintain it, the period that it will last will deteriorate. There is a percentage of balance that we must replenish every year. Not less than five percent every year. You must clean so that you will remove the dust and rebalance”, he said.
