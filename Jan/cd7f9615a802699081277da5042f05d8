The Nigerian Senate, on Tuesday, adjourned plenary for lack of quorum. This is the second time that senators would adjourn their plenary sitting in about three months. On November 13, 2018, the senators were forced to adjourn their plenary session due to same reason of not meeting the required quorum. There are 109 senators in the Red Chamber, and based on their rules, a plenary sitting could only be held when there are, at least, one-third of the senators present at the commencement of the session. The one-third of the Senate is 36 senators. At the commencement of Tuesday’s plenary at about 10:30.am, it was observed that less than 10 senators, including Senate President Bukola Saraki were present. Other senators present included; Senate Chief Whip Sola Adeyeye (APC, Osun), Minority Whip Philip Aduda (PDP, FCT), Deputy Whip Francis Alimekhena (APC, Edo), Deputy Minority Whip Emmanuel Bwacha (PDP, Taraba), Barnabas Gemade (SDP, Benue), Gbenga Ashafa (APC, Lagos), Shaba Lafiagi (PDP, Kwarai) and Andrew Uchendu (APC, Rivers). Our correspondent observed that after the adjournment, senators such as Baba Kaka Garbai (APC, Borno) and Kabiru Gaya (APC, Kano) arrived for the sitting. Having observed that the Senate did not meet quorum to sit, Adeyeye moved a motion that the Senate adjourn sitting to Wednesday, which was adopted by the senators present. Plenary session is where the senators sit to make laws and pass resolutions.
