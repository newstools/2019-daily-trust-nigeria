Jigawa state chapter of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), donated relief materials worth N10 million to the victims of last year’s flood disaster in the state. The chairman of the state chapter of the NLC, Comrade Usman Ya’u Dutse, made this known during a symbolic distribution of the relief material that took place at the State Secretariat of the Union in Dutse. According to him, the money for the purchase of the relief material was raised after each of the civil servant in the state had donated the sum of N200 saying, the decision for the humanitarian intervention was reached after all the industrial unions in the state toured to sympathize with the victims. He explained that the donation was expected to be distributed across 13 affected local government areas in the state, adding that the distribution exercise was planned to be in conjunction with the Jigawa State Emergency Management Agency. “When the NLC received the sad news, a high-power delegation of all the chairmen and secretaries of the existing industrial unions visited the affected areas and sympathized with victims. During the sympathy tour, the union leaders witnessed the very sorry and deplorable situation the people found themselves. “This informed the decision taken by the NLC state Executive Council (SEC) for the N200 per worker contribution to the victims to ameliorate their suffering. “It is a clear testimony of the concern of the Jigawa State Workforce to the social and economic wellbeing of our communities.” Speaking to Daily Trust, one of recipient of the relief material, Ahmed Musa, commended the labour union for the laudable gesture saying, he lost all his belongings to the flood but with this intervention, it would cushion the effect of the disaster he experienced last year.
