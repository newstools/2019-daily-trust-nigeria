About 120 entrepreneurs, yesterday, got grants to start up their businesses after an intensive training last year. The grant was disbursed by the senator representing Kwara South Senatorial District at the National Assembly, Dr Rafiu Adebayo Ibrahim. The beneficiaries, who were selected across the seven local government areas of the senatorial district, were part of the 2017 first batch of 200 youth that participated in the two weeksâ€™ entrepreneurship programme by the Entrepreneurship Development Centre of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The programme was held in collaboration with RIB Foundation, a brainchild of the legislator. Speaking at the presentation of business grants to the trained participants held at Ganmo, Ifelodun Local Government Area of the state, Senator Rafiu noted that the solution to unemployment in the country was not the sole responsibility of government. The legislator disclosed that he decided to provide N10 million grant to the beneficiaries in continuation of the empowerment scheme he floated for the people of his constituency.
