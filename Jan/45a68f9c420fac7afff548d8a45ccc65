Operatives of the Zonal Intervention Squad of the Zone 2 Police Command have arrested two robbery suspects, Oseni Uman, 34, and Taiwo Orogbemi, while allegedly on their way to Lagos to sell a stolen Toyota Sienna bus. The Public Relations Officer, Zone 2, Chief Superintendent Dolapo Badmos, who confirmed the arrest, said the command’s operatives, while on Visibility Policing in the Ogere Remo of Ogun State, intercepted a brown Toyota Sienna bus occupied by the two suspects on December 31, 2018. Badmos said, “On searching the vehicle, a locally made cut-to-size gun with three live cartridges were recovered from it. Consequently, the two suspects were moved to police base for investigation. Upon interrogation, they confessed to have robbed residents of the Akobo Area of Ibadan in Oyo State where they stole goods worth millions of naira. They also admitted that part of their loot like phones, laptops and other gadgets had been sold to some receivers in Oyo State, while the Sienna bus was being taken to Lagos where a ready buyer was waiting for it.” Badmos further revealed that the suspects confessed to have formed a gang while serving their jail terms in Agodi Prison, Ibadan, and that their operational base is at Ibadan.
