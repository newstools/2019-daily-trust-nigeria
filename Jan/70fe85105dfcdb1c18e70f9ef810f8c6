The Chief of Army Staff Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, in conjunction with the First Bank of Nigeria Plc, Tuesday launched the Agent Banking Scheme at the 20 Battalion of the Nigerian Army, Serti, Taraba State. He  said this was to bring banking services closer to the barracks community, especially to the officers’ wives. He said this would enhance economic activities within the barracks and their host communities. “Our partnership between Nigerian Army Welfare Limited/Guarantee is to provide easier and more convenient ways of banking for our personnel”, Buratai said. He urged officers and soldiers trained to run the banking programme to do so transparently and in accordance with financial rules and regulations to ensure sustainability.
