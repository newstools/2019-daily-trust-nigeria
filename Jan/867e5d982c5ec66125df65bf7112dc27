Kaduna Electric Distribution Company says it is committed to supplying uninterrupted power to all its coverage states. A statement from the company’s head of corporate communications, Abdulazeez Abdullahi, said it would redouble effort in the new year to ensure that it maintained the steady power supply currently enjoyed in its franchise states. It said: “As we usher in the New Year 2019, the board, management and staff of Kaduna Electric wish their esteemed customers a prosperous and rewarding year. “We would like to use this auspicious occasion to thank all our loyal customers for their steadfastness in settling their electricity bills promptly which has helped us in no small measure in enhancing our operations and efficient service delivery efforts. We also appreciate them for their patience at those times when we were unable to meet their expectations. “We reiterate our commitment to redouble our efforts in the new year to ensure that we maintain the steady power supply being currently enjoyed in various neighbourhoods in our franchise states. “While we count on the unwavering support of our loyal customers, we call on those customers who are reluctant to settle their bills, have outstanding debts and indulge in energy theft and meter bypass to stop these acts of sabotage and have a rethink and work with us to deliver uninterrupted power supply to all. It is not rocket science. Working together, we believe we can do it.’’ Steady power supply puts generator dealers out of  business in Kebbi Kaduna Electric signs contract for 200,000 meters We certified over 4,000 power projects in 3 years – NEMSA MD
