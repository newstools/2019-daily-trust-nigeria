The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar has appealed to Nigerian women to use their numerical strength to vote out President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the February 16, election. Speaking Friday in Abuja, at a Women Conference with the theme, “Call for Action”, Atiku said he promised women 35 percent of the slots in his government, if elected, because of their numerical strength and pattern of voting during elections. “Therefore between youth and women you have 70 per cent of the government. This is to prepare you to take over governance, to take over this country and make it work again. “So, this is your opportunity, you are not going to be put in the other room, I promise you because you have seen my wives here, they are not in the other room. “In my three decades of politics, the most consistent voters in the Nigerian political process I have seen are women. I have practically seen it, when we use to vote on queues not through ballot papers. If i stand as a candidate and I turn my back to look at the lines that are supporting me, the women lines are always three times that of the men,” Atiku said. The PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus said there would be crisis in the country if the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) did not conduct free, fair, transparency and credible elections. The Director General of the PDP Presidential Campaign Organization and Senate President, Bukola Saraki said women were naturally gifted to carry out a course to its logical conclusion and charged them to campaign vigorously for PDP to reclaim power.
