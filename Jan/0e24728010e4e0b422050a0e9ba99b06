The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has warned the general public to be wary of any person(s) parading themselves as recruitment agents of the Authority, and consequently extorting money from innocent citizens in the process. For the purpose of clarity and emphasis, the Authority is not embarking on any recruitment exercise at the moment, FAAN said in a statement by the General Manager, Corporate Communications, Mrs. Henrietta Yakubu. “The Authority wish to inform the public that recruitment into any government agency has a stipulated procedure, which includes advertisements in national dailies and her official website and social media platforms, in line with the provisions of the Federal Government’s conditions of service”, it said. It said any person claiming to be an agent of the Authority in this respect “is a fraudster and should be reported to the Authority or the nearest police station”.
