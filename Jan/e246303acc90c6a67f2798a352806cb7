The Zamfara  State House of Assembly, yesterday, suspended four of its members over alleged allegiance to the G-8, an APC faction in the state led by Deputy Governor Ibrahim Wakkala, Senator Kabiru Marafa and Minister of Defence retired Brigadier-General Mansur Dan-Ali among others. The suspended members were Hon. Mansur Musa Bungudu, Hon. Mani Malam Mummuni, Hon. Abdullahi Dansadau, and Hon. Salisu Musa Tsafe. At its emergency sitting yesterday, House Leader Hon. Isa Abdulmumini asked the House to suspend the members over what he described as “acts of indiscipline and disobedience to the government and leadership of the Assembly.” The Chairman, House Committee on Education, Hon. Kabiru Moyi Birnin Magaji confirmed the development to Daily Trust. He said an ad hoc committee was set up  to look into the activities of the embattled legislators, saying they would remain suspended pending the outcome of the committee’s investigation. Speaker of the Assembly, Hon. Sanusi Garba Rikiji announced the suspension of the members. Earlier, three vice chairmen of Zurmi, Birnin-Magaji and Gummi local government areas were sacked over alleged romance with some members of the G- 8. The vice chairman of Zurmi Local Government Area, Alhaji Abubakar Dauran, told the Daily Trust that as loyal members of the APC,  it was wrong to sack them  because of their political opinion.
