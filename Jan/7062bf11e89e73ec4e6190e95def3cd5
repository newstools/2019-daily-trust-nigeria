Less than 24 hours before President Muhammadu Buhari’s campaign visit to Yobe,  the 27 task force brigade in Buni Yadi came under Boko Haram attack. Buni Yadi is also home to Nigerian Army Special Forces Training School. A panicked resident told Daily Trust that the attackers arrived in five Hilux vans laden with anti-aircraft guns around 5:00pm and headed directly to the military location. “I saw vehicles with Boko Haram flags shooting sporadically and shouting ‘Allahu Akbar’,” she said. She said that her house and that of her neighbour were hit by bullets. Another resident said the militants had engaged the army in serious gun duel but there was aerial support by fighter jets in the town. However, there’s been no statement from the military on the attack.
