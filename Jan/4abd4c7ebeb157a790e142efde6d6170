The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) said it is supplying electricity to Kano electricity Distribution Company (DisCo) through alternative feeder after a transformer tripped causing a 90 megawatts (MW) loss at the Kumbotso Transmission Substation. While the faulty 150MVA transformer is being repaired, TCN in a statement by the General Manager, Public Affairs, Ndidi Mbah, said the DisCo gets bulk electricity through the other two units of 150MVA transformers in the substation. Daily Trust reports that the faulty transformer tripped on January 1, 2019 which caused the loss of 90MW on the Kano –Kankia – Katsina 132KV transmission line that feeds Kankia, Katsina and Daura in Katsina state and the Kumbotso – Dakata 132 kV transmission lines in Kano. The fault affected supply of electricity in about eight towns that include Kankia, Katsina and Daura in Katsina state; Sabon Gari, Dakata, Bompai, Mariri and Gezawa in Kano state. “TCN engineers have equally carried out intensive tests on the faulty transformer. The tests revealed that short circuit in the winding caused the tripping. Consequently, requisite parts for repair work were quickly procured and repair works have commenced,” it noted. The company said it was working with the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) to fast track the clearance of its transformers to install another 150MVA 330/132kV transformer in Kumbotso Substation and other substations to provide more sources of bulk electricity supply. TCN apologized for inconveniences to the people affected in the supply areas adding that, “the transformers once installed, would further increase total transmission capacity nationwide.” TCN restores Funtua substation electricity after Kano DisCo fire TCN restores Funtua substation electricity after Kano DisCo fire TCN commissions 3 transformers, substation in Katsina
