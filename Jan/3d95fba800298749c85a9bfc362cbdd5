Governor Simon Bako Lalong of Plateau State has described the crowd that greeted President Muhammadu Buhari’s visit to Jos at the weekend as “the mother of all rallies.” He said “the unprecedented” turnout was not the first time the people of the state showed love and support for President Buhari. Daily Trust reports that thousands of supporters overwhelmed security agents at the Rwang Pam stadium, venue of the rally, preventing the president or any of the dignitaries from making a speech. President Buhari only waved at his teeming supporters and an hour later, left the stadium through a rear exit.  However, Lalong said in a live discussion on national television that the uncommon crowd was typical of Buhari’s visits to Plateau all the time. “When he visited Plateau in 2011, he was unable to get out of the vehicle due to the mammoth crowd and could only wave at the people,” Lalong said. “In 2014 when he came to campaign, the crowd was so overwhelming that a stampede unfortunately claimed three lives. “The crowd had been expected because everywhere the president goes, a huge crowd followed him but what we witnessed in Jos was so overwhelming that people are now calling it the mother of all rallies,” the governor said. He stated that the chances of APC in the state were bright, especially since Saturday’s rally had attracted people from across the state irrespective of ethnic and party affiliations. He said his administration had done well in the last four years and therefore deserved reelection.
