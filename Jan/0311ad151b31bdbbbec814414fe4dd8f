A coalition of Civil Society organisations in Nigeria, under the banner of Occupy Nigeria, on Monday took over the streets of Yenagoa, in Bayelsa state to protest the suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Walter Onnoghen. The coalition also gave President Muhammadu Buhari 48-hour ultimatum to reinstate him or face more protests. Speaking to newsmen after the peaceful demonstration at the popular Tombia roundabout in the state capital, the convener, Mr Tony Ile, said the action of the Buhari-led administration has returned Nigeria to the dark days of anarchy. The protesters numbering over 100 carrying placards with inscription such as “Reinstate Onnoghen Now”, “Democracy In Nigeria Is Dead” and “Buhari Should Be Impeached” said the government should be ready for more protests if it does not reverse its suspension of the embattled CJN after the deadline. “This unfortunate development has openly shown the utmost desperation and determination of Buhari to rig the forthcoming general elections across the country in favour of his party, the APC. “Nigerians could recall how this President has on several occasions flouted and disobeyed various court orders. The question Nigerians are asking is: why would the President choose which court order to obey and which not to obey. “For your information, there was already a Court of Appeal order restraining the CCT from continuing with the trial pending the determination of the suit before it. This, the President ignored and still went ahead to suspend the highly revered Chief Justice of Nigeria,” he said. They also called on the NJC to, without further delay, sanction Justice Ibrahim Tanko Mohammed for making himself available to what they described as “ungodly judicial coup.” Onnoghen: Senate leadership meets, legislators may reconvene Tuesday Onnoghen: What President Buhari must do -CDD, TMG Onnoghen’s suspension in line with democratic justice-Lagos lawmaker
