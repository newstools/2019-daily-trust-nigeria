Seventeen people died in North-East Uganda when a truck carrying traders from neighbouring Congo overturned, police said on Monday. Another 10 people were injured when the truck’s brakes failed on a steep slope in the region of Panyimur on Sunday, local police spokesperson Josephine Anguca told dpa. “The traders were going to a fish market from the Congo. We have yet to establish the number of people on the truck,’’ she said. Road accidents blamed on drunk driving, over-loading and poor mechanical condition of vehicles are common in Uganda. 15 Kebbi cattle traders die in trailer accident Truck crushes four, injured many in Ibadan 51 die in Sokoto, Kogi, Abia, Osun road crashes
