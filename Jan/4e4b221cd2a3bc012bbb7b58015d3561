A coalition of Kano youth with Permanent Voters Card, Kano Voter’s Voice (KVV) on Wednesday called on President Muhammadu Buhari to reverse the decision on the suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen and reinstate him back without delay. Speaking on behalf of the coalition at a press briefing in Kano, the National Coordinator of Kannywood door-to-door initiative, Malam Mika’il Isa Bn Hassan said the Judiciary is an independent arm of government. He said it should remain as clearly stipulated in the Nigerian constitution adding that the suspension of Mr. Onnoghen contradicted the provision of the constitution. “The CJN was suspended unconstitutionally, because section 292 of the Nigeria’s Constitution has stated how the CJN should be suspended or sacked accordingly. “The present drama in the suspension of the CJN is causing a bad name to Nigeria and Nigerians in the international community circle,” he said. He added that failure of the President to reinstate the CJN would leave the coalition with no option than to use their PVCs to vote out the government of the day in the general elections. He stressed that Nigerian democracy is still young and the only way to sustain its legitimacy is through the use and enforcement of the use of the rule of law.
