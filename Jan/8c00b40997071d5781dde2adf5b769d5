He was there before as Vice President. He has done it before and he will do it again. He was the one who led President Obasanjo’s economic team. The eight years was meaningful to Nigeria. The APC government which is barely four years in power and everything has gone worse. “We’re in bondage. Vote Atiku to liberate us. It’s an inclusive government that we are going to have because it would be the government by the people and for the people.
