Officials of the Comptroller General of Customs Strike Force have intercepted about N8.39 billion worth of Pangolin shells allegedly being smuggled out of the country by some foreigners. The Pangolin shells were allegedly stockpiled in sacks and were being taken out of the country when operatives of the strike force got wind of the movement. This latest recovery brings to about N12 billion Pangolin shells recovered by officials of the service in Lagos alone. The Federal Operations Unit (FOU) Zone A had earlier in the year intercepted N4 billion worth of Pangolin shells. Four Chinese were also arrested for their involvement in the illicit trade. Addressing journalists, yesterday in Lagos, the National Coordinator, Comptroller General of Customs Special Strike Force, Deputy Comptroller (DCC), Abdullahi Karowa, said the Pangolin shells were among N9.3 billion worth of goods seized in the Western Zone in the last one month. He said seven persons were being detained in connection with the different seizures. “Investigation is still ongoing and at the end the suspects would be charged to court,” he added. Karowa further disclosed that the bags of rice seized have been forfeited to the Federal Government. He said the ban on importation of rice through the land borders is still in force and that those involved in smuggling were economic saboteurs and when arrested would be treated as such.
