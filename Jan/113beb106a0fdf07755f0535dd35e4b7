Tens of thousands gathered across Venezuela to march in protest against President Nicolás Maduro. Four people were said to have died in clashes before the protests, as riot police mobilise to guard demonstrators. National Assembly president Juan Guaidó, who organised the opposition march, urged the army to disobey the government. On Wednesday he took an oath where he declared himself as “acting president” of the country. Before the protests, the US government signalled its support for Mr Guaidó and called for President Maduro to go. Early images from Wednesday’s protests show some demonstrators facing off against National Guard security forces in the capital Caracas, and tear gas being fired. Anti-government protestors have turned up in “many cities” across the country, newspaper Tal Cual reported Wednesday. Other demonstrations were being held in support of Mr Maduro. Venezuela has been in economic freefall for a number of years under the president’s leadership.
