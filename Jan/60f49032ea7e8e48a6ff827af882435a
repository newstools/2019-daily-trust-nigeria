Sudanese security authorities have arrested several faculty members from Khartoum University, two professors said, after they joined anti-government protests that have posed the most serious challenge to President Omar al-Bashir’s rule. The arrests on Sunday came amid fresh demonstrations in Sudan’s capital Khartoum and other cities in response to a call by a coalition of professional unions to push for Bashir to step down. Witnesses told the Reuters news agency that security forces blocked professors and lecturers from coming out to protest outside the university, arresting at least eight. It was the first time the faculty of the country’s oldest and most prestigious educational institution joined the protests since they began last month. The rest were forced to return into the faculty clubhouse, where security forces surrounded the building trapping about 100 professors and lecturers inside for nearly three hours.
