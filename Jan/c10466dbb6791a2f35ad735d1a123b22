A former Chief Economist/Group Head, Research and Economic Intelligence Group of Zenith Bank, Marcel Okeke, has said the plan by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to achieve a single currency for the region by 2020 is no longer realistic. Okeke spoke at the Finance Correspondents Association of Nigeria (FICAN) 2018 Economic Review and 2019 outlook held in Lagos at the weekend. Okeke, who is now the Lead Consultant, Mascot Consult Limited, said a single currency for the region came with some challenges and criteria that many of the member countries would not be able to meet. He said the ECOWAS common currency had been on for many years and needed the member countries to attain key milestones for its successful takeoff.
