The Vice Chairman of Abuja Municipal Area Council, Lawrence Onuchukwu, has urged Igbo residents in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to shun violence during the forthcoming elections. Onuchukwu, who spoke to journalists during the annual prayer session to begin the year organised by the Ohaneze Ndigbo in the FCT, said members of the association and other residents should not engage in violence during the election but ensure that they cast their votes with free conscience. “They should come out and vote, not violence. Don’t make trouble and stay out of trouble, cast your vote according to your mind,” he said. Onuchukwu, who is a stakeholder in the association, said praying to begin a new year is an annual ritual by the group but they decided to pray for the success of the 2019 election since it is close. “We recognise the fact that from year to year you thank the Almighty for sparing your life. Today we are here to thank the Almighty for the beginning of the New Year. “We are also here to pray to God for the peaceful conduct of 2019 election and to pray for the president that the election will be successful and peaceful,” he said. The interdenominational prayer which was held at the Old Parade Ground on Saturday was attended by members of the Ohaneze Ndigbo in several communities including Tungan Maje and Masaka.
