The father of a female police officer, Mrs Yemisi Makinde, killed in the April 5, 2018 robbery attack in Offa, Kwara State, has been reported dead in Ilorin. The late Mrs Makinde, nee Oyeyemi, was one of the nine police officers the armed robbers gunned down during the attack. Mr Oyeyemi, a retired Inspector in the Nigeria Police Force, who hailed from Agbonda town, Irepodun local government council area of the state, had reportedly fallen ill immediately after the tragic death of his daughter. He eventually died at the weekend at his country home, Upper Gaa Akanbi area of Ilorin, exactly nine months after his daughter was killed. A relation of the deceased said that Mr Oyeyemi had developed high blood pressure due to shock from his daughter’s death. It was also gathered that all the drugs he had been using to manage the ailment failed to achieve the desired change, a development that complicated his illness at the weekend and ultimately claimed his life. The remains of the deceased had been deposited at the mortuary of the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital Complex, Ilorin. It is recalled that the robbers killed about 33 residents of the town, including many police officers, during the attack. Five suspected armed robbers are facing trial at the Ilorin High Court over the attack.
