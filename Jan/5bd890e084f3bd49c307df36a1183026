The Wednesday’s extra ordinary security council meeting convened by the Katsina State Government over kidnapping and banditry has identified lack of synergy,  operational  vehicles and personnel as key issues that must be addressed to improve security in the state. The Secretary to the State Government, Mustapha Inuwa, while briefing newsmen yesterday on the outcome of the meeting, said it had been resolved that the state governor, Aminu Masari, will meet with his Kaduna and Zamfara counterparts as well as Maradi in Niger Republic to work out a common front towards confronting the menace. He said the Katsina state government had agreed to fix the several police vehicles across various divisional police posts in addition to an already request sent to the Inspector-General of Police to support with additional personnel and equipment, especially Armoured Personnel Carrier. He said the meeting also looked at the issue of enhancing community policing especially with regards to informants’ operation which was identified as a stumbling block in the operation. “It has been agreed that forests close to towns to be de gazetted and converted to farm lands. These close forests serve as hideouts and routes for kidnappers,” he said.
