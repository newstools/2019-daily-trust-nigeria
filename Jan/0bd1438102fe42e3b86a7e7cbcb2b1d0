The Kuje chapter of Abuja Gbari Forum (AGF) has endorsed the re – election of the incumbent chairman of the council, Alhaji Abdullahi D. Galadima, for a second term in the March 9, 2019 council polls. Chairman of  the forum, Mr. Ayuba S. Noma, stated this after the forum’s meeting, which had the council chairman, APC chairman, Godwin Poyin and other party chieftains in attendance at Rubochi on Saturday. He said the forum executives after series of meetings unanimously decided to endorse the council chairman for another term, saying the Gabri forum was a platform where the elders come together to deliberate on issues that affect all Gbari natives of the council. He said Galadima’s administration had improved on rural infrastructure especially tackling the perennial water problem in some rural communities. “Today, the present leadership of APC under the chairman, Abdullahi D Galadima, has been able to provide boreholes in  major villages in Kuje, which is among the reason the forum decided to unanimously endorse him for second term,” he said. The chairman of the council said he was elated by his endorsement by the forum. He said his endorsement by the forum was a clear indication that despite the challenges of paucity of funds, his administration had tried its best to provide infrastructure.
