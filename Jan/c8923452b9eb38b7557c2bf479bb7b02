He noted that the population of Nigeria, however, based on the latest United Nations estimates stands at over 198 million and that this huge population size creates a challenge for proper and even allocation of resources to the citizenry. BRISIN is an integrated system for the collection, storage and distribution of information to support the management of the economy. According to him, BRISIN will “also create databases that store and preserve information over time. The accessibility of consolidated data in a single and accessible location is favorable for the utilisation of both current data and for chronicled information that has been accumulated over time.” “This strategy for information stockpiling guarantees that all data will show up where and how it should, and that it will stay in that area for future reference. ] “This additionally takes into consideration the possibility to watch patterns and changes in the information over time,” he added.
