Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League (AL) party has won Bangladesh’s parliamentary vote, the country’s election commission has announced, after the main opposition alliance rejected the violence-marred polls. Three-hundred seats were up for grabs in the 350-member parliament, or Jatiya Sangshad, in Sunday’s elections. Another 50 seats are reserved for women. An AL-led coalition won a massive 288 seats, while the main opposition alliance dominated by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) secured just six.
