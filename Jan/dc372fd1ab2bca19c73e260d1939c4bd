A retiree, Prince Lateef Oyelayo, yesterday told a customary court in Oja-Oba, Mapo, Ibadan that his wife, Olabisi, has stolen his manhood since 2004, and has poisoned his food and water severally. Oyelayo, a retired employee of NIPOST, also alleged that Olabisi wanted to kill him to inherit his property. The court heard from the petitioner that life has been miserable for him since he lost his job in 2005, with his wife not caring a hoot about his plight. “It is true that I sold our chairs in the house to force her out of my house. I know if she doesn’t see chairs to sit, she would leave my house. I bought a grinding machine for her to trade with and care for the family but she didn’t use the machine.  I had to sell the grinding machine, my car and deep freezer so I could survive. The last time we had sex was 15 years ago. I don’t want her again,” he said. But Olabisi denied having a hand in her husband’s poor sexual performance, and generally described her husband’s allegations against her as baseless and mischievous. “He started fighting with me because I didn’t allow him to sell our house,” she said. Demanding that the court dismiss the divorce petition, Olabisi declared that she had “a legal marriage” with Oyelayo and “you (court), therefore, lack the jurisdiction to hear the matter.” The president of the court, Chief Ademola Odunade, struck out the petition for lack of jurisdiction.
