Governor Abiola Ajimobi yesterday mandated the Oyo State police command to fish out perpetrators of the mayhem that occurred at the weekend at different locations in the state, saying that anyone arrested should be treated like “a hardened criminal.” Hoodlums had gone on rampage late Saturday and early hours of Sunday at Idi Arere, Asaka and Oja’gbo areas of Ibadan destroying vehicles and setting shops on fire. Ajimobi, who was represented by his deputy, Otunba Moses Alake Adeyemo, in a visit to the areas yesterday, said that the StateEmergency Management Agency (SEMA) would do the assessment of losses from the crisis so the government could assist the victims. The governor warned that stiff measures would be meted to all those who caused the mayhem. Urging politicians not to politicize the activities of hoodlums he said were bent on creating hardship for the people, he called on political leaders to rather join hands with the government to condemn criminal activities and provide crime-control information to law enforcement agents. The Commissioner of Police, Oyo State Command, Mr Abiodun Odude, urged the people to show understanding during the response of policemen to distress call, stating that the police needed more intelligence from the people to get their work done. Odude disclosed that 11 people had been arrested in connection with the Idi Arere mayhem.
