A Federal High Court in Kano, yesterday, nullified the election of Sha’aban Ibrahim Sharada, the Personal Assistant to President Muhammad Buhari on Broadcast Media as APC flag bearer for Kano Municipal Federal Constituency. The Presiding Judge, Justice Sa’adatu Ibrahim, while giving her ruling on the case, said based on the provision of  Section 3 of the Electoral Act,  political parties lacked jurisdiction to substitute candidates elected through legitimate process. According to her, Mukhtar Ishaq Yakasai was the authentic candidate because when the date was set for primary elections, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was not aware of any candidate aside from Yakasai. “As such, the court considered the result of the election was the authentic because Ishaq won the election,” she said. She, therefore, directed the APC to immediately submit the name of Yakasai to the INEC for consideration and other necessary actions. The Judge also ordered INEC to recognise Yakasai as the duly elected APC candidate of the Kano Municipal Federal Constituency for the polls. Speaking to newsmen shortly after the judgement, counsel to the complainant, Mr M. M Duru, expressed satisfaction with the judgement saying his client was the authentic candidate. However, counsel to defendant (Sharada), Jimoh Moshood, said they would appeal the judgement. Yakasai, a former Chairman of Kano Municipal Council, had filed a case against APC, INEC and Sharada on the ground that he was the person duly elected during the APC primary elections held in October 2018. But to pacify him after he was substituted, Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje recently appointed him as a Commissioner for Special Duties in his cabinet.
