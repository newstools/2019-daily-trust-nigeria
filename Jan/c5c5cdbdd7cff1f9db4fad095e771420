Supporters of former President Goodluck Jonathan in Bayelsa State have dispelled rumour that the former leader is supporting candidates from opposition political parties in his home state ahead of the general elections. They  also warned Bayelsa State Governor Henry Seriake Dickson, against trying to allegedly blackmail the ex-president because of the forthcoming elections in the state, saying it was laughable that the cronies of the governor were trying to push the baseless claim that  Jonathan was engaging in “anti-party activities.” The spokesperson of ‘Stakeholders and Loyal Members of PDP in Bayelsa,’ Amb. Kenny Sotonye, told journalists in Yenagoa, yesterday, that there was no way former President Jonathan, the highest beneficiary of PDP in the South-South, could support any other party against the PDP on which platform he served as deputy governor, governor, vice president and president. “Dr. Jonathan by virtue of his unwavering and unparalleled  commitment to the unity, progress and continued corporate existence of Nigeria even without recourse to his meritorious service to the country up to the highest office in the land, has by his actions earned the stripes of an elder statesman and should be accorded all the respect such standing demands’, he said.
