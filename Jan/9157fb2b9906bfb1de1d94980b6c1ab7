There was a mild drama on Tuesday afternoon as the new Commissioner of Police, Kayode Egbetokun, arrived the Lagos State Command Headquarters, Ikeja, with the intention to take over leadership of the police in the state from Imohini Edgal as he was told that the scheduled hand over would no longer hold. A hand over between the two Commissioners of Police had been earlier scheduled for 3pm. CP Egbetokun who was previously in charge of the Police Anti-Bomb Squad had stormed the command with his convoy and met Edgal who was prepared for the handing over. It was gathered that as they were having a closed-door meeting, a phone call believed to be from the newly decorated Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, came in and directed that the handing and taking over should be cancelled till further notice. Edgal who briefed the press in company with Egbetokun said: “Gentlemen of the press, are you here for the handing over and taking over? Are you here because you love me or you are eager for me to leave? Well there is a directive that the status quo should remain till further notice.” Egbetokun who came with his chair and other personal effect and his personal staff left the command immediately. He only said: “We are government agents and we are always taken directives.” As Edgal was also leaving for Abuja, to meet with the new IGP, there was gunshot salute.
