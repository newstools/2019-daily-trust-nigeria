The Assistant Inspector General of Police in charge of Zone 7, AIG Godwin Nwobodo, has tasked policemen in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to be neutral in the forthcoming elections. Nwobodo, who was recently deployed to the zone which also covers Niger and Kaduna states, said this during a working visit to the FCT Police Command headquarters. He said although there were challenges and concerns, what was of utmost importance were the elections coming up in February and March this year. “Elections have threatened our national security in the past and we must not allow that this time around. “I want us to realize that we have serious task ahead of us and we must not take this election for granted. We must be seen to be fair and firm in the discharge of our duties. I don’t want to see anybody taking sides because the Nigeria Police Force is not a political party. “The police predates the All Progressives Congress (APC) and other political parties. As we approach the elections, I urge you to rededicate yourselves and do what is right,” he said. The FCT Commissioner of Police, CP Bala Ciroma, while briefing the AIG on measures put in place to ensure a hitch free election, said the command recently organised training for its personnel and other sister security agencies. He also said the command was collaborating with other non-governmental agencies to carry out more of such training before the elections. CP Ciroma said the AIG’s visit would not only boost the morale of officers and men in the command, but also further prepare everyone for the task ahead.
