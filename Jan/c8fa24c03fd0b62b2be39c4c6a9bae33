A former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, and presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the February 16 election will on Monday flag off his campaign in Lokoja, Kogi state. The spokesman of PDP in Kogi state and Secretary of the Media and Publicity committee of the partyâ€™s campaign council in the state, Mr Bode Ogunmola, confirmed this to Daily Trust in Lokoja on Sunday. He said all necessary arrangements were being made for a successful rally billed to hold at the Lokoja Confluence Stadium. He said the earlier issues surrounding the use of the Confluence Stadium as venue of the rally had been resolved adding that the state government has given the party approval to use the facility for its presidential campaign tomorrow. Ogunmola therefore urged party members and enthusiasts of its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar and running mate, a former Anambra Governor, Peter Obi, to come out en masse from across the 21 local government areas of the state for the rally.
