Nine people have been arrested in Kenya following an attack on a luxury hotel compound in the capital Nairobi that killed at least 21 people. All five militants who stormed the DusitD2 hotel and business complex on Tuesday have been killed, officials say, and a major hunt is under way to find those who helped organise it. Somalia-based Islamist group al-Shabab says it was behind the attack. Kenyaâ€™s Red Cross says everyone who was missing has now been accounted for. Kenyan media reports that the wife of one of the suspected attackers has been arrested in Kiambu county, just north of Nairobi.
