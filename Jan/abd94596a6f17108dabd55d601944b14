The Peoples Democratic Party Presidential Campaign Organization (PPCO) has said the defeat of ruling party’s candidate, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)’s Presidential election, was another pointer to the impending defeat of President Muhammadu Buhari in the February 16 presidential election. The PPCO, in a statement signed by Kola Ologbondiyan, its Director of Media and Publicity, said: “It is instructive to note that the people of DRC asserted their power of control and prevailed in enthroning the leadership of their choice.” The statement, which congratulated DRC and the President-elect, Felix Tshiekedi for his victory at the polls, noted that such determination was inevitable in the February 16, 2019 Presidential election in Nigeria. “The victory of opposition candidate and particularly the relegation of the ruling party to third position in the election despite the daunting challenges is a confidence booster for Nigerians on Atiku Abubakar’s victory despite the shenanigans and rigging schemes of the Buhari Presidency and the All Progressives Congress (APC). “Nigerians should not also forget that in March 2018, opposition candidate in Sierra Leone, Julius Maada Bio defeated the ruling party’s candidate. “In December 2017, opposition George Weah defeated the sitting Vice President Joseph Boakai of Liberia while in December 2016, opposition party candidate, Nana Akufo-Addo defeated the incumbent President of Ghana, John Mahama. “Those relying on rigging to shortchange Nigerians on February 16 should therefore be reminded, that as demonstrated in the DRC, the power of the people remains greater than the power of few. “We therefore call on all Nigerians, particularly, the over 17 million Nigerians who have been rendered jobless by the Buhari Presidency…to remain resolute in the national resolve to vote in the PDP Presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, as the next President to restore good governance, national cohesion and economic prosperity in our land,” PDPCO said.
