Chairman of the FCT chapter of All Nigeria Confederation of Principals of Secondary Schools (ANCOPSS), Comrade Abdulkarim Abdulrahman, has solicited for the support of stakeholders in the education sector to ensure rapid development of youth in the territory. Abdulrahman, who stated this during his visit to some schools in Abuja on Tuesday, stressed the need for stakeholders and school principals to redouble their effort in imparting requisite knowledge in the younger ones. He stated that lessons in all secondary schools across the six area councils had commenced, adding that was in line with the tradition of the FCT to start classes once schools resumed. He urged parents to ensure their wards start school in the first week of resumption to enable them to partake in all academic activities such as resumption tests and other sundry activities. He also appealed to government to provide teachers with necessary tools to enable them conduct their teaching in a more conducive and favorable environment for the benefit of the students. Abdulrahman, who is also the principal of Junior Secondary School (JSS) Zuba, further appealed to government to provide more structures and instrumental materials with a view to meeting the challenge of the high influx of people into the FCT.
