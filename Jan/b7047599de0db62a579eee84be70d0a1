The Group Managing Director of the foremost ground handling company, Nigerian Aviation Handling Company Plc. (nahco aviance), Mrs. Olatokunbo Fagbemi, has given an insight into why the company adopted a group structure with her recent appointment as the Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer. The GMD/CEO arrangement replaced the MD/CEO previously used by the agency. Fagbemi, explaining why the company had to run a harmonised group structure, said since the company is a group with a number of subsidiary companies, it has to be properly run as a group in a way to bring value to shareholders. She stated this while playing host to a delegation of the Ikeja District of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) which paid her a courtesy visit at the Ikeja head office of the company. With the adoption of the group structure, all NAHCO subsidiary companies, including NAHCO Free Zone (NFZ), Nahco Energy and Power (EPI) and Mainland Cargo Options Limited (MCO), will report directly to the GMD/CEO. A statement by the Manager, Communications and Corporate Services, Tayo Ajakaye, quoted the GMD as saying NAHCO would partner with ICAN on human capacity development, the company also said yesterday. She pointed out that the company will leave no stone unturned in giving the best training to its staff and enhancing their capacity to deliver the best services to its clients. Meanwhile, Ajakaye in a chat with Daily Trust in response to the recent withdrawal of German airline group, Lufthansa as a shareholder of NAHCO said the company was undergoing a repositioning drive with acquisition of new modern equipment.
