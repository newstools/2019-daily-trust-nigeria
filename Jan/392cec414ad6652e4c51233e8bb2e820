The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, has commended members of Original Inhabitants Youth Empowerment Organization for their pledge to ensure the victory of President Muhammadu Buhari in the forthcoming elections. Malam Bello made the commendation when he received the youth organisation officials who were in his office for a solidarity visit, yesterday. The minister said the work of rebuilding and restoring the fortunes of the nation could not be achieved in three and half years hence the need to give Buhari another four years to consolidate on the remarkable achievements recorded so far, and to take Nigeria to the next level. On the efforts made to clear arrears of severance benefits owed former councillors and political assistants by successive administrations, the minister stated that he was merely implementing the directive of Mr. President, who always identified with the plight of the common man, and an advocate for justice and the rule of law. “You will recall that the party we took over from was not APC, and definitely those who benefitted from the payments were not APC members, but we had to pay because it is at the root of humanity that anyone who works is entitled to the fruits of his labour,” he said. The minister expressed surprise that some of the officials were still being owed and pledged to do something about it. The president of the youth organisation, Commander Isaac David, stated that the visit was to show appreciation to the FCT minister for the significant progress made in the territory and for breaking what he described as the tradition of leaving former political office holders in the lurch as a result of non-payment of their severance packages.
