The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Yobe state has called on Governor Ibrahim Gaidam to stop dragging military into the “murky waters” of politics in the state. The Deputy Chairman of the Party, Alhaji Adamu Mohammad Rama, made the call in a statement in reaction to a report where the governor accused the military of helping PDP to rig the 2015 elections in some parts of the state. According to the statement, the governor’s claim was not only untrue but unfortunate. If his claims were true, why didn’t his party go to court to challenge the results? Why is Gaidam making these claims now?” Rama said the governor is merely making empty threats that will not change the choice of the party’s electorates for the 2019 general elections. It will be recalled that Governor Gaidam had on Wednesday at the APC zonal campaign rally for Yobe South, accused the military of aiding the PDP to rigged 2015 senatorial election in the zone. 2015 elections: Gov.
