The Federal Government has said that the presidential candidate of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar has a corruption case to answer when he returns to the country from the United States. Minister of Information and Culutre, Lai Mohammed who disclosed this to State House reporters today, said Atiku who left the country yesterday, will explain his role in the collapse of the defunct Bank PHB when he returns. Lai said fresh evidence has revealed that the former vice president benefitted from the slush funds that led to the collapse of the Bank PHB, former Habib Bank. Lai said the federal government has the account mandate, cheque and account statement showing Atiku as the signatory to the account that received part of the slush fund. “We want him to stay in the US for as long as he wants but he has to explain to Nigerians when he returns. “ We are not perturbed about his trip. He can go ahead and get a US green card. That will not save him from imminent defeat in the forthcoming election, ” he said. 2019: Obasanjo’s endorsement won’t save Atiku – FG APC, PDP in endless battle over corruption, economy Protesters ask US Embassy not to issue Atiku visa
