A Karmo Grade 1 Area Court in Abuja yesterday sentenced two men, Chukwuemeke Madunatu and Alloy Chuks, to four weeks imprisonment for disturbing public peace and mischief. Madunatu and Chuks, who reside in Gwagwa village and Old Karmo respectively, admitted committing the offence and were sentenced for the two-count charge of disturbance of public peace and mischief. The area court judge, Alhaji Inuwa Maiwada, however, gave the convicts an option of N3,000 fine each and warned them to desist from committing such misdeeds. He also ordered the two to pay N20,000 as compensation to the complainant. The prosecuting counsel, Mrs Ijeoma Ukagha, had earlier told the court that Oshiafi Hassan reported the matter at the Utako Police Station on Jan. 16. Ukagha informed court that Madunatu and Chuks engaged in a serious fight in front of Peace Park in Utako, using dangerous weapons, which led to the disturbance of public peace. He told the court that in the process, the two men broke the windscreen of the complainantâ€™s Volkswagen car, which was valued at N20,000, with some dangerous weapons. He said their offence contravened sections 113 and 327 of the Penal Code Law.
