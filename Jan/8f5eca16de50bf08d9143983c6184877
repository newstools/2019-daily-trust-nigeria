Power Generation Companies (GenCos) have decried the huge burden they bear as the Distribution Companies (DisCos) sustain energy rejection, only paying for what they wish to take daily. The Executive Secretary of the Association of Power Generation Companies (APGC), Dr Joy Ogaji, in a statement, also accused the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) of complicity. She said prior to 2015, the Generation Companies (GenCos) declared how much they can generate (Available Capacity) daily and the System Operator (SO) nominates the capacity for transmission. “In every electricity market, this nominated capacity is paid for and with consideration for the suppressed capacity as prompted by SO’s instructions. A reasonable return on capital invested in the business is a critical incentive for continued improvement in technical capacity as well as quality of service,” she explained. However, APGC said in 2015 when the regulator, NERC, in preparing for the Transition Electricity Market (TEM), “came up with the obnoxious new capacity definition entrenched in the enabling TEM Supplementary Order No. NERC/15/0011 dated 18th March, 2015.” Dr Ogaji said the new NERC rule meant that GenCos can only be paid for what the system could take and not what GenCos are willing to sell. “The regulator, NERC, went on to direct that the metered energy be converted into capacity for billing. This regulatory directive, on a monthly basis, brings down the actual billable mobilised GenCos capacity, leading to the DisCos billed less. “It is believed that this reduction of capacity during billing was instigated by the DisCos and the regulator approved of it,” she alleged. “What incentives does the market hold for GenCos to invest towards recovery of unavailable capacity when they are denied capacity payment for what is already provided and maintained but not called up.” GenCos decry huge power losses from DisCos’ rejection, NERC complicity Electricity: Protests, progress as privatised sector clocks 5 ‘Customers’ buying electricity from GenCos, DisCos to boost competition’
