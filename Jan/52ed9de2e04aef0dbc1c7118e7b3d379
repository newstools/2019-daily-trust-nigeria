A Toronto landscaper accused of killing eight men who went missing between 2010-17 has pleaded guilty to their murders. Bruce McArthur, 67, was arrested last January and charged in the deaths of two men, and police subsequently charged him in six other cases.  Most of his victims had links to Toronto’s Gay Village neighbourhood. Many of the victims’ remains were found in plant pots on one property in Toronto’s Leaside neighbourhood. Each of the first-degree murder charges carry an automatic life sentence, meaning he will not be able to apply for release until the age of 91.
