The Young Progressives Party (YPP) says it is not featuring in the 2019 general poll to add to the number of parties on the ballot paper, but to win. YPP National Chairman, Mr Bishop Amakiri said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Abuja. Amakiri said the party would make history by recording victory in the presidential election, as it has one of the best candidates- Prof. Kingsley Moghalu. “We are well prepared for 2019 general election. We are not out to make up the number of political parties on the ballot paper, we are in the race to win. “Nigerians are tired of recycling leaders who cannot solve their problems or meet their aspirations. They are in dire need of young and vibrant leaders and political parties and that is what the YPP represent. “That is why we have a vibrant and intelligent Nigerian as our presidential candidate in the person of Moghalu who has what it takes to revive the economy and improve the welfare of the people,’’ he said.
