An EFCC source also told Daily Trust yesterday that the Director General of the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) Ayo Oke and his wife will be arraigned before Justice Aneke of the Federal High Court in Lagos on February 1, 2019. Oke was sacked as the director general of the NIA by President Muhammadu Buhari on October 30, 2017. In April 2017, he was suspended after EFCC officials raided an apartment at Osborne Towers in Ikoyi, Lagos (which he later described as a ‘safe house’) and found $43.4 million, 28,000 Pounds Sterling and N23 million in the apartment.
