The APC chairman in Niger State, Engineer Jibril Imam, has lashed out at a former governor of the state, Dr Muazu Babangida Aliyu, describing him as an example of a corrupt leader. Apparently reacting to comment credited to the former governor during the PDP rally in Bida, recently, where he said the APC-led administration in the state had failed to meet the basic needs of the people, Imam said the PDP under Aliyu impoverished the state and its people by diverting monies meant for its development to personal use. “Aliyu is an example of a corrupt leader and that is why he is in court. He impoverished the state because monies meant for the development of the state were diverted. So it is not the APC administration in the state that failed the people,” he said. He said unlike the PDP, the APC’s strength, as the clock ticks towards the election year, was its developmental strides across the state. “They are jittery about our performance; they know that they have lost the elections before the contest even begins,” he noted.
