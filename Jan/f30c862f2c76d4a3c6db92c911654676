Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi has said that the State Trafic Management Agency (EKSTMA) will henceforth be more rigid in its enforcement of street trading laws to avoid a repeat of last Saturday night tragedy that claimed about 12 lives. He also said government might be compelled to re-introduce some old laws and previous arrangements to deal with the menace. He stated this on Sunday while commiserating with the people of Iworoko Ekiti over the accident in the town. The governor, who had earlier directed the Deputy Governor, Otunba Bisi Egbeyemi, to pay condolence visit to the community on Sunday morning, said he was saddened and devastated by the news of the fatal accident. Noting that many lives have been lost to the recklessness of many trailer drivers, he said market stalls were constructed in various local government areas in order to discourage street trading, adding that government will now accelerate completion of those markets and build new ones to avoid a repeat of these tragedies. Fayemi urged the community leaders and families of the victims of the accident to remain calm even as “we collectively mourn the death of our beloved ones in the unfortunate incident.” Page 8 Trailer loaded with campaign rice crushes 15 to death in Ekiti Curfew in Kaduna, govt urges calm
