President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday appealed for tolerance among cattle herders and farmers in the country. Receiving leaders of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) in Abuja, he called for calm among all citizens, saying his government would give equal respect to all citizens irrespective of their ethnic, religious or geopolitical backgrounds. “I appeal to all farmers and herders for restraint, mutual respect and tolerance for one another as people destined to live together in this great country. I appeal for patience and understanding as the administration works towards lasting solutions to these conflicts,” he said. The president called on state governors to work with the Minister of Agriculture whom he said had been mandated to work out a solution with the states whereby herders will have access to water for their livestock, and farmers will have security against destruction of their farmlands. MACBAN, led by Alhaji Mohammed Kiruwa, said the body had sent the delegation to endorse his bid for a second term.
