The Chairman of Kuje Area Council, Alhaji Abdullahi D. Galadima, has urged clerics in the area to be bold and tell them (politicians) the truth whenever they err so that they can make amends. Galadima stated this when he joined  members of the Rubochi branch of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) at  ECWA church service in the area yesterday. He said as a human being, nobody was perfect, hence, everyone was bound to make mistake even when such person was occupying leadership position. He said giving useful and constructive criticism would enable such leaders to correct their mistakes. He appreciated the efforts of the spiritual fathers for their selfless prayer to ensure peaceful coexistence in the council. Also speaking, the vice chairman of CAN in the area, Pastor Ezekiel Isa, commended the council chairman and his entourage for paying a visit to his congregation at the church. He charged the chairman to continue to provide dividends of democracy to the people that elected him into office, saying the only reciprocation the masses deserved from their leaders was to provide amenities that would impact on their lives. “Although we have seen what your administration has been doing in terms of infrastructure, we are urging you to improve on it, as we will continue to pray for you to succeed,” he said. ‘We’ll not repeat mistake of voting PDP again’ Incumbency not a threat to me  - Kuje chairmanship aspirant ‘I’m worried about increase in kidnapping’
