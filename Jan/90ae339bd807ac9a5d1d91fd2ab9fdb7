Women Radio 91.7 (WFM) has called on Nigerians to shun violence against women and increase their participation in the forthcoming general elections. The managing director of the station, Toun Sonaiya, who stated this during an advocacy visit to INEC office in Magbon, Abeokuta in Ogun State, said the commission had a major role to play in ensuring that the 2019 general elections were devoid of violence against women so as to allow them exercise their civic rights to vote and be voted for. She added that the station would track incidences of electoral violence against women. The head of department, Votersâ€™ Education and Publicity, Gender and Civil Society Organization, Olori Adenike Tadese, said INEC had made provisions for pregnant women, the elderly and persons living with disabilities across the state with adequate security personnel, adding that priority would be given to vulnerable persons during elections.
