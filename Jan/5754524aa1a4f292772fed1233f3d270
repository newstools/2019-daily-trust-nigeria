Some Egbura indigenes of Abaji Area Council, under the auspices of Egbura APC Progressive Association, have promised to deliver 4,000 votes to the incumbent chairman of the council, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, in the March 9, 2019 council polls in the area. Chairman of the association Alhaji Ahmed Mohammed Oyoyo stated this during the formal endorsement of the chairman, which held at Adamu Shuaibu memorial town hall on Sunday. He said the Egbura  group had declared their support to the APC administration from the presidency down to ward level. He said the performance the APC-led administration at the council to the federal level had convinced Egbura indigenes of the area to throw their weight behind the re-election of Buhari, National Assembly candidates of the party and the chairman of Abaji Area Council in the forthcoming elections. He added that the Egbura indigenes were grateful to the chairman for appointing some Egbura indigenes into prominent positions such as the LEA secretary and council secretary, among others. “It is on this basis that we the Egbura have unanimously resolved to throw our weight behind the re-election of Buhari, National Assembly candidates as well as the incumbent chairman of Abaji Area Council, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, God willing,” he said. The area council chairman, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, expressed delight over the overwhelming support given to him by the Egbura indigenes of the council, describing the move as the first of its kind since he has been contesting for the council chairmanship.
