The President, Yam Farmers, Marketers and Processors Association of Nigeria (YFMPAN), Prof. Simon Irtwange, said yesterday that the association was targeting 5,750 tons of the commodity for export  this year. Irtwange gave the figure in an interview with   the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. He said the association was working on the issues that prevented it from achieving the target it set in 2018. “We are hoping that the facilitator of the Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP) will bring back yam production to its priority list. “We hope also to strike a good deal with the airlines and DHL, to use their cargo planes to export the produce. “We are also working to ensure that the Ikorodu Terminal becomes a one-stop-shop and a hub for agricultural-produce export in the country,” Irtwangee said. The YFMPAN president said from the Ikorodu Terminal, the produce could be ferried into ships, thus avoiding the gridlock on the roads. He noted that shipping agricultural produce, especially yam, requires urgency because of their perishable nature. The professor said the heavy gridlock on the roads delayed the movement of agricultural produce to the ports for shipment in the past years. He revealed that the association, in conjunction with yam stakeholders, would increase its advocacy on the need to amend the Export Promotion Act. Prof Irtwange noted that the association would also ensure that ABP loans to yam farmers did not come with harsh conditions, adding that would enable them to cultivate the produce without hitch. He said the value of yam production was higher than that of cassava, millet and sorghum that were being given much attention. The professor said that the association would be leveraging on what the company already on ground at the Ikorodu terminal, had to offer. (NAN)
