And those behind the balderdash said that the governor, Owelle Rochas Okorocha has announced his defection from APC to AA to join his son-in-law, Uche Nwosu, during the New Year Crossover Service in Government House. He said the stories emanated from “all those who stole the guber tickets of their parties for the 2019 election and have become stranded and looking for who to blame for their woes or misfortune. “They know this fact. Imo people do not support anything stolen. That was the reason they dealt with 419ers in 1997. “It was out of frustration that those concerned came up with the story of Governor Okorocha leaving APC for AA, which is not true,” the statement added.
