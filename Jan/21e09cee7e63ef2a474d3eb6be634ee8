The ‎judgement of a Federal High Court in Abuja that INEC was right by not accepting candidates of the APC from Zamfara State supersedes that of a high court in the state which ruled otherwise, Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa, has said. Marafa said although INEC said it was studying the two conflicting judgements, he believed the commission would stick to its position that there were no primaries in Zamfara APC. Briefing journalists at the National Assembly, yesterday, Marafa who chairs the Senate Committee on Petroleum (downstream), noted‎ that some governors now relied on the popularity of President Muhammadu Buhari to win elections. Asked on the call in some quarters for INEC to obey the Zamfara court’s judgement, Marafa said: “That judgement was procured. You want INEC to abandon the Federal High Court’s judgement and obey a procured judgment?” On his next line of action, Marafa said he had already appealed the judgement of the Zamfara High Court, adding however that there were frantic efforts to frustrate the appeal, and he may end up at the Supreme Court. ‎ Marafa said he would prefer to go for the best candidate wherever the person was rather than settle for the worst that the party may present in the state. “If APC decides that the worst APC candidate is better than the best candidate from somewhere, I will respect them. But that can’t be true, so I will go for the best for my people even if it means APC losing Zamfara State. I don’t give a damn. After all, we’re in a mess in Zamfara State.” Marafa lauds Abuja court judgment on Zamfara, to appeal State High Court ruling Judgements on Zamfara APC put INEC in difficult position Marafa meets Buhari, says Zamfara gov’ship tussle to be resolved soon
