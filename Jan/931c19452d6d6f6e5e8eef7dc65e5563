A middle-aged man identified as Kayode Michael, who was caught last week in Akure, the Ondo State capital, with female pants, bra and a blood-soaked sanitary pad, has been taken to a psychiatric hospital for medical examination. Michael was taken to the hospital by officials who told Daily Trust that the move was to confirm the man’s mental state. Eyewitnesses had suspected Michael was a ritualist pretending as a madman to commit nefarious acts. The suspect, who was rescued by men of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps from a mob, was said to have been parading himself as a madman last week at the Danjuma area of Akure. A source said he was first noticed by commercial motorcyclists who became suspicious of his moves and decided to find out what he had in his bag. Grabbing the bag from him, they discovered it contained blood-soaked sanitary pads, female pants and bra and descended on him, giving him the beating of his life. He was about to be killed when he was rescued by two men who quickly called the attention of some NSCDC officers to the scene. Family members of the suspect argued that Michael habitually collected things from the dustbin. According to one of them, he had been engaging in begging and scavenging. The spokesman for the Ondo State command of the NSCDC, Mr Oladapo Samuel, said no witness was willing to speak with the agency’s officers on the circumstances of Michael’s apprehension to determine if he was actually caught with the exhibits, or that he was merely checking the nylon bag containing the exhibit believing it contained other valuables. Samuel said the medical report on the suspect was being awaited.
