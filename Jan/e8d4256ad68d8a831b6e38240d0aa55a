The Presidential Campaign Council of President Muhammadu Buhari has asked the presidential candidate of PDP, Atiku Abubakar to throw in the towel and endorse him instead of spreading falsehood against him. Spokesperson of the council, Festus Keyamo was reacting to the allegation against President Buhari by Atiku on the purchase of Etisalat and Keystone Bank. According to Keyamo, “The widely published rebuttal by investors in Etisalat and Keystone Bank that the family members of President Buhari have nothing to do with both companies is another indication of the fast-collapsing campaign of the presidential candidate of the PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and that of the PDP. “The result of the fact-check which was published in some news outlets, clearly shows the depth of desperation, deceit and debauchery to which the Atiku campaign has sunk. They have no moral compass, no scruples, no direction in their present attempt to smear just everyone in sight in order to run a campaign of ‘we-are-all-corrupt.’ “Rather than respect the feelings of Nigerians by offering clear-cut responses to straight-forward allegations of tax-evasion, grand corruption in and out of office, impending sealed indictment waiting for him in the US, Atiku Abubakar has decided to drag the world down with him as he goes down in a blaze of infamy. “He has decided to go wild with wild, unsubstantiated allegations against the President and the vice president, throwing caution to the wind in the process,” he said. He called on Atiku and the PDP to apologize to Nigerians and especially the family of the president for adopting this unwholesome tactics and telling tales by moonlight that had clearly backfired.
