The trial has started in Lagos of a 29-old-year motorcycle commercial rider, Jamilu Abubakar, who was alleged to have stolen his own motorcycle from the police station. The police arraigned Abubakar on Friday before chief magistrate Aro Lambo sitting at the Igbosere magistrate court on a count charge of stealing. Police prosecutor Sunday Ehizabor informed the court that Abubakar was arrested at odd hours with his motorcycle on Christmas day, December 25, 2018 and the motorcycle was thereafter detained at the Bar Beach police station, Victoria Island, while Abubakar was released. Ehizabor said the accused, however, returned the next day, December 26, 2018 to the station at about 9am, retrieved his motorcycle and attempted to bolt with it. But vigilant policemen on duty and passers-by were able to arrest him. The prosecutor alleged that by that act, the accused stole his own Bajaj motorcycle registration number EKY 440 QJ valued at N150,000 from police custody. But Abubakar pleaded not guilty to the one count charge saying that he only went back to pick his motorcycle. Further hearing has been fixed for January 9, 2019.
