The Chairman of the Presidential Advisory Committee on the Elimination of Drug Abuse, retired General Buba Marwa, has called on all stakeholders to urgently increase efforts against the rate of drug abuse in the country. He warned that two generations of the country were in the process of being wiped out as a result of hard drugs if urgent interventions were not carried out. Speaking during a visit by the committee to the director general, National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Prof. Moji Adeyeye, yesterday in Abuja, Marwa said the committee would set up sub-committees that would visit zones, engage relevant stakeholders at the states, local governments, and community levels. While saying that the present administration was concerned and will effect changes to end the scourge, he pointed out the visit was aimed at engaging NAFDAC as the committee had done with other key stakeholders. Director General, National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Prof. Moji Adeyeye, blamed the rate of drug abuse on the country’s porous borders, and the withdrawal of NAFDAC from the ports from 2011 to 2018.
