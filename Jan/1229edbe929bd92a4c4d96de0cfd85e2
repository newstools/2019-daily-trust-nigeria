The new Commissioner of Police, Ekiti State Command, Mr Asuquo Amba, has assumed duties with a promise to strengthen community policing in the state with a view to reducing crimes and all forms of criminality. Amba promised to ensure that his men and officers operate within the ambit of the law and shun all forms of illegalities that could put the Force into disrepute or embarrass the nation in the eye of the international community. Before his new assignment, Amba was Commissioner of Police, in charge of Counter-terrorism in Abuja. He succeeded Mr Ahmed Bello, who has retired from the Force. “Our intention is to achieve the task of making Ekiti crime-free, soas to create an enabling environment for business and economic activities to thrive. Everyone shall be equal and given the same attention in the interest of peace,”he said.
