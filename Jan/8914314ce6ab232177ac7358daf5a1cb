A 40-year-old man, Abdul Ibrahim, yesterday appeared in a Karshi Grade 1 Area Court, Abuja, for alleged N840,000 land fraud. The defendant, who resides at Nyanya village, Abuja, is standing trial on a three-count charge of criminal breach of trust, cheating and criminal misappropriation. The prosecutor, Mahmud Lawal, told the court that a written petition by the complainant, Eucharia Ogedengbe, was received at the Karu Police Area Command, Abuja, on Sept. 18. “In the course of investigation, it was discovered that sometime in 2017, the complainant was informed of a landed property, located at Jikwoyi Layout, Abuja. “The complainant entrusted N800,000 to the defendant, who claimed to be the owner of the said property and N40,000 to one Angela Osimlalu, an agent introduced to her. “After entrusting N840,000 for the said land, it was discovered that the land did not belong to the defendant and he dishonestly converted the money into his personal use,” Lawal said. He said the offences contravened the provisions of sections 312, 322 and 309 the Penal Code. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The judge, Aliyu Kagarko, granted bail to the accused in the sum of N1 million with one surety in like sum. Kagarko said the surety must reside within the court’s jurisdiction and must own a landed property within the Federal Capital Territory. The case was adjourned until Jan. 30, for hearing.
