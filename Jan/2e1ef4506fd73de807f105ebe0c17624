The national electricity grid recorded a peak generation of 4,932 megawatts (MW) on Monday with the 11 Distribution Companies (DisCos) receiving 102,218 megawatts hour (MWH) energy worth about N2.484 billion to supply to over six million customers. The highest peak power generation this year remains at 5,104MW recorded on January 10, data from the Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing and the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) show. While peak generation on Monday was 4,932MW, the lowest was 3,735MW obtained from 24 Generation Companies (GenCos). The 11 DisCos got 102,218 megawatt hour (MWH) energy for onward dispatch to households and industries. A Daily Trust analysis showed that with that quantum of power distributed and adequate revenue collected, the Nigerian Electricity Market (NEM) should generate at least N2.484bn for that day based on a flat rate. This was computed using the N24.30 tariff for Residential customers (R2) of Abuja DisCo per kilowatt hour (KWH). Supplying 1MWH of electricity will earn a DisCo N24,300. Further analysis showed that retaining that tariff for the 102,218MWH supplied, the market would amount to the N2.5bn. While the rise in electricity generation seems to be a plus, this paper reports that the constraints of low energy demand (load rejection) by DisCos and water issues at the Shiroro hydro GenCo caused the estimated loss of 941MW on the day under review. The rejection of 791MW by the DisCos affected the capacity of seven GenCos. According to their distribution order, Afam VI in Rivers State was the biggest loser with 350MW as it shut down because there was no order to dispatch it to the DisCos.
