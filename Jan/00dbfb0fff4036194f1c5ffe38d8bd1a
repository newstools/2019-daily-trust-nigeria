The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) has commissioned three transformers and a substation in Katsina State. While two transformers of 80MVA capacity were commissioned at the new 132/33kV transmission substation in Daura, another 60MVA transformer was commissioned at the existing substation in Katsina town. TCN spokesperson, Mrs Ndidi Mbah, in a statement in Abuja yesterday, said both projects were commissioned by the governor of the state, Aminu Bello Masari. She said the new Daura substation has two units of 40MVA transformers with six units of 33kV feeders; it was built to resolve the electricity supply situation in Daura and environs. At the existing substation in Katsina town, she said the new 60MVA transformer with three units of 33kV feeders has increased the station’s transmission capacity from 120MVA to 180MVA. “It makes available more bulk electricity for Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) to take to its customers in Daura, Katsina and environs,” Mbah noted. TCN said it is sustaining works in creating a robust transmission grid in line with its Transmission Rehabilitation and Expansion Programme (TREP) through which the firm said about 20,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity wheeling capacity will be available by year 2021.
