have been attacking their members, destroying their campaign facilities and vehicles.

He also alleged that the party had attacked a health facility belonging to PDP at Shuni local government area, robbed its staff and destroyed all its facilities and vehicles. “These attacks have become more frequent and sustained in their despair attempt to take over power in the state by all means,” he alleged Reacting to the allegation, the Publicity Secretary of APC, Sambo Danchadi said the ruling PDP in the state had reached the end of the road, thus resorting to whipping up sentiment by playing the victim, by bidding behind an imaginary political thuggery. “Reliably information has it that two lives were lost in Binji while three other innocent individuals were murdered in Wurno by the PDP thugs. This is in addition to razing down properties belonging to our members,” he said He added that ” it is therefore, no artificial tinkering with the reality in ground can change the course of history. Let PDP leadership in Sokoto brace up for the challenge of deficit in infrastructure, convenient atmosphere for trades as well as descent politics and stop the vociferous cry of blue murder.”
