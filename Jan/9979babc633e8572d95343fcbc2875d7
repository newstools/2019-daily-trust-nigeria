The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has condoled with Nigerians over the death of Hajiya Aisha Lemu. The late Hajiya Lemu was the pioneer National Amirah of the Federation of Muslim Women Associations in Nigeria (FOMWAN) and wife of Justice Ahmed Lemu, a former Grand Qadi of the Shariah Court of Appeal, Niger State. The Director of MURIC, Prof. Ishaq Akintola, said yesterday that Mrs. Lemu was a very resourceful woman, a prolific writer and author of many Islamic books. The late Lemu studied at the University of London’s School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) and later obtained a postgraduate degree in English language, before she converted to Islam at the Islamic Cultural Centre, London, in 1961. “During her lifetime, the late Aisha Lemu served as the principal of Government Girls College, Sokoto and Women Teachers College, Minna. She also founded the Islamic Education Trust (IET) together with her husband. Aisha Lemu was well known for her piety, generosity and diligence. It will be difficult to fill the vacuum she has left behind. “May Almighty Allah forgive her, have mercy on her and repose her gentle soul in Al-Jannah Firdaus. May Allah also grant her caring husband, her children and all members of her family the strength to bear this irreparable loss,” Akintola said.
