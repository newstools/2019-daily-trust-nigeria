The Ekiti State governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, has said that the State Traffic Management Agency (EKSTMA), will henceforth be rigid in its enforcement of street trading laws to avoid a repeat of last Saturday’s night tragedy that has claimed 15 lives so far. Fayemi also said government might be compelled to re-introduce some old laws and previous arrangements to deal with the menace. The governor stated this on Sunday while commiserating with the people of Iworoko Ekiti over the accident in the town. Noting that many lives had been lost to the recklessness of many trailer drivers, he said market stalls were constructed in various local government areas in order to discourage street trading, adding that government would accelerate the completion of those markets still under construction and build new ones to avoid a repeat of auto tragedies. He urged community leaders and families of the victims of the accident to remain calm even as “we collectively mourn the death of our beloved ones in the unfortunate incident.” Fayemi promised that the state government would consider areas of support for the families of the victims with a view to ameliorating their pains.
