The exodus from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Akwa Ibom State continued on Monday with the defection of a former commissioner representing Akwa Ibom State on the Board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Mr Etim Inyang Jnr, and 2,000 others to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Mr Inyang, the son of a former Inspector-General of Police, Late Chief Etim Inyang, led the group of defectors during the APC campaign rally in Mbo Local Government Area. Addressing the mammoth crowd at the rally held at Enwang, the local government headquarters, Mr Inyang said he defected to support Obong Nsima Ekere, the APC governorship candidate, to take the state to the next level. “I am borrowing a leaf from Apostle Paul in the Bible who said that he was not ashamed to follow the gospel of Jesus Christ. I am not ashamed to follow Obong Nsima Ekere from the bottom of my heart because he is the one to take us to the next level,” he said. He assured Obong Ekere of a clean sweep of Mbo’s 51,112 votes. Mr Inyang expressed gratitude to Obong Ekere who was barely two weeks in office as Managing Director of NDDC in November 2016 when he made the road leading to the venue of his father’s burial accessible. Receiving the defectors, Mr Ini Okopido assured them of equal rights and privileges with old members of the party.
