The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) has installed two 60MVA 132/33kV power transformers in its Benin and Onitsha (Anambra) Transmission Substations. The Benin 60MVA transformer supplies bulk electricity to Benin Electricity Distribution Company’s (BEDC) load centres, while that of Onitsha Substation was energized recently. The General Manager, Public Affairs’ spokesman of TCN, Mrs Ndidi Mbah, said the projects are additions to the over 35 transformers that have been energised across the country using TCN in-house engineers. Also at the Benin substation, TCN said work has reached advanced stage in the installation of a second 60MVA 132/33kV power transformer that would replace the 60MVA capacity transformer accidentally damaged by the trace clearing crew of Benin Distribution Company recently. “TCN engineers are currently in the substation working assiduously to ensure that the second transformer is completed and energised,” it said in a statement. TCN reiterated that the only way that it’s Rehabilitation and Expansion programme can give maximum benefit to the nation, is if a commensurate investment is done on the various distribution networks nationwide. The company reiterated its willingness to continue to work with other sector players to ensure Nigerians derive maximum benefit from investments in the sector.
