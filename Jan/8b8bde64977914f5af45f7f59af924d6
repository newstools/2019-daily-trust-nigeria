Workers of the aviation agencies resumed work on Wednesday after the New Year holiday amidst prayers and thanksgiving for the feats recorded in the out-gone year 2018. One of the prayer points was the sustenance of accident-free record in the sector just as the workers prayed for a successful and peaceful conduct of the 2019 elections. The workers, both Christians and Muslims, who converged at the headquarters of the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) said there was every cause to rejoice for the safety recorded last year. They prayed for good health, wisdom and knowledge for themselves in the task of piloting the affairs of the sector. At the NCAA, an Imam, Alhaji Ahmad Chindo who led the Muslim prayers said besides doing the right things, prayers also play a role in invoking God’s protection for the industry. He appealed to members of staff to be disciplined and avoid any act of corruption or sharp practices that could tarnish the image of the agency and the industry in general. Chindo advised the staff to support the present administration’s fight against corruption and the management for the continuous safety in the sector through enforcement of regulations. Pastors Wilfred Haggai and Maxwell Achonwa also prayed against plane crashes and any form of security threat in the industry. On their part, the union leaders vowed not to backtrack in their threat to shut down the agency in the next two weeks if their demand for promotion was not met. The Director General of NCAA, Captain Mukhtar Usman, represented by the Director of Consumer Protection, Alhaji Adamu Abdullahi, he appealed to the unions to sheathe their swords as efforts were on to address the issues. He called for the assistance and cooperation of staff to achieve more successes in the New Year.
