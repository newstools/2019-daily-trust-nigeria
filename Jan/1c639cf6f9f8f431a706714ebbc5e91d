Over 20 persons have been burnt beyond recognition following a petroleum tanker explosionÂ  this evening in Calabar. The tanker which was loaded with petroleum products fell along Odukpani axis of the Ikom-calabar highway near the Federal Housing estate. An eye witness said the number of persons burnt would be far higher when the huge inferno subsides. The eyewitness said people were seen running to the scene with gallons and other containers to scoop fuel when the tanker veered off the road into a ditch on the roadside. Rescuers were able to bring out burnt bodies which were close to the road side. The sight was grave.
