The Democratic Alternative (DA) has suspended its governorship candidate in Cross River State, Dr. Charles Offiong-Ephraim, for endorsing the APC governorship candidate, Senator John Owan-Enoh. Ephraim was one of the 15 governorship candidates in the state who recently endorsed Owan-Enoh. However, his party, yesterday, took the decision to suspend him during its meeting held in Calabar. State chairman of the party, Edet Bassey, said neither himself nor the party was informed of his desire to endorse another candidate. “Our governorship candidate has involved himself in illegal activity. Members of the party, especially the exco, were not aware of his decision to endorse another candidate of another party.  Such action was illegal and uncalled for,” he said. A four-man committee had been set up to investigate Ephraim’s alleged activities and report back within one week after which the party would take the next action. Ephraim declined to speak with news men about the allegations levelled against him.
