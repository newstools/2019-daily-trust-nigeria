The Federal High Court, Abuja, on Friday barred the All Progressives Congress (APC), from fielding candidates in Zamfara in the forthcoming general elections. This is coming on the same day that a High Court in Gusau presided over by justice Muhammad Bello Shinkafi  affirmed that the ruling All Progressive Congress in Zamfara state had conducted primaries elections on 3rd and 7th October 2018. Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of the Federal High Court, Abuja, affirmed the decision of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), foreclosing the party from participating in the election. Justice Ojukwu held that the position adopted by INEC with regards to Zamfara APC was in tandem with the law and would help to instill discipline. It will be recalled that INEC had barred the APC from fielding candidates in Zamfara for the general elections for failing to conduct its primaries within the stipulated time. APC, not satisfied with the decision, filed a suit in court challenging the decision of the electoral umpire. In the suit, the APC prayed the court to declare that INEC’s letter of Oct. 9 was null, void, ultra vires and of no effect, having regards to the provisions of Sections 31(1) and 86(2), (3) and (4) of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended). INEC’s letter of Oct. 9 had stated that it was excluding the party from presenting and submitting the list of its candidates for the forthcoming election in Zamfara scheduled for 2019. The electoral body said the exclusion was on the grounds that the APC failed to conduct its primaries within the stipulated time.
