The wife of the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Jennifer Douglas Abubakar, has urged Nigerians not to be deceived by the smear campaign against her husband, Atiku Abubakar, saying he meant well for the country. Mrs. Abubakar disclosed this in Benin at a town hall meeting with the women’s wing of PDP on Monday. Speaking at the event tagged: “Let’s Talk,” she said the name calling is targeted at tarnishing the image of her husband. She said if elected, Atiku would tackle insecurity, healthcare and economic problems currently bedevilling the nation. “There are some issues I want you to consider come February 16 when voting for your presidential candidate. In Edo, we are aware that you have issues with security, you have issues with healthcare and the economy that is general across Nigeria,” she said. According to her, to change the narrative, we need to vote for the right candidate, adding that the right candidate is Atiku Abubakar. She explained that for Nigerians to put an end to the myriad of problems confronting the nation, they should vote her husband to end the suffering of Nigerians. “Democracy gives room for both the rich and the poor in the society to decide who governs them; based on this, voters’ apathy must be discouraged in order to have a better society and a better country. “Findings tell us that the highest votes come from 18-35 years old and this percentage are from youths and women. So, it is important that we all come out and vote for Atiku/Obi candidacy that has promised a certain percentage for the youths and the women,”  she admonished.
