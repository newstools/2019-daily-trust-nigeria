The Police in Jigawa State have disrupted the flag off of North-west Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)’s zonal campaign. Speaking to newsmen, the party’s deputy chairman, Babandi Ibrahim Gumel, said he only learnt this morning that the State Police Commissioner Bala Zama Senchi called that the approval earlier given to the party for the zonal rally in Gumel, had been withdrawn. He added that the Police commissioner cited that the approval was withdrawn after the police realized that the day approved for the rally was coincidentally, the market day of the town. The Police said that there was a probability for hoodlums to take over the rally and  create chaos in the town. When contacted, the spokesperson of the state police command, SP Abdul Jinjiri, said he was yet to be briefed on the matter.
