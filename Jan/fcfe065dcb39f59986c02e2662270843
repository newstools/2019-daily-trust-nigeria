President Muhammadu Buhari’s reelection bid received a boost weekend following the donation of 100 vehicles and campaign secretariat by an All Progressives Congress (APC) stalwart in Niger. The vehicles and a three-storey building were donated by APC senatorial aspirant for Niger East senatorial district,  Mohammed Musa popularly referred to as Sani 313 on Sunday. The donation ceremony was part of the activities lined up during President Muhammadu Buhari’s visit to Niger state but rescheduled because of the President’s tight schedule. Governor Abubakar Sani Bello commissioned the building and received the vehicles on behalf of the President on Sunday. Bello commended the stalwart for the gesture, even as he urged the Buhari Support Organizations (BSO) and the Presidential Campaign Council(PCC) to make judicious use of the items donated. Also speaking, Sani who made the donation, said, “It is my  resolve to wholeheartedly support a man who has demonstrated  high level of good  leadership and commitment to nation building. We have seen how he has steered the nation from the brinks of collapse, rescuing almost all the critical sector of our national lives. “A purposeful leader like President Muhammadu Buhari must be given all the necessary support,” he noted.
