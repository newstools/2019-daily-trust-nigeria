The Chairman of Gwagwalada Area Council, Alhaji Adamu Mustapha, has called on members of the All Progressives Party (APC) and his supporters to vote for all the candidates of the ruling party. He said his supporters should vote for the party’s candidates from the president to councillors during the 2019 general elections. Mustapha, who made the call during a meeting with APC ward and local government executives, said there was need for party members and supporters to vote for all candidates because of the good changes the ruling APC has brought under President Muhammadu Buhari. He said it was for that purpose that he decided to hold the meeting with all the ward and local government executives in order to come together and resolve whatever grievances some of them might have especially regarding the just concluded party primaries in the area. Also speaking, the chairman of APC in the area, Alhaji Hussain Deze, stressed the need for all party’s ward and local government supporters to work hard so that the party emerges victorious in the elections. He also urged party members not to engage in anti-party activities, saying the strength of the APC was in the hands of its members and supporters. City News also gathered that the council chairman met with the opposition APGA ward and local executives on Saturday, where they declared their support for his re-election for a second term.
