The Buhari Support Organisations (BSO), Delta State Chapter, has said the All Progressives Congress (APC) South South Presidential Rally in Uyo, Akwa-Ibom State last Friday had established the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari as a national movement. In a statement issued Wednesday, the group’s head of media and member of the APC Presidential Campaign Council, Elsie Ijorogu-Reed, said unlike the 2015 general elections that ushered in the APC administration at the federal level in which the region recorded a ridiculous less than five percent total votes for President Buhari and the APC, the 2019 presidential election promises to be a watershed in the annals of South South politics. “In spite of orchestrated devious propaganda being peddled by the relevance-seeking parties against an irreproachable President Muhammadu Buhari, the mammoth that converged at the South South presidential rally in Uyo was a clear testimony of the popularity and acceptance of the President’s leadership. “As the Delta State chapter of Buhari Support Organisations (BSO), the umbrella body of the President’s foot soldiers across the country, we make bold to declare that contrary to the ridiculous results of the 2015 presidential election, the February 16, 2019 presidential polls will witness landslide victory of Mr. President in the region. “We are indeed spurred by the tremendous achievements of the PMB administration, despite enormous challenges, economic sabotage and political distractions that have continued to confront the government, the PMB-led APC administration has refused to be swayed from its focus on the Change agenda. “We challenge the opposition doubting his achievements and delivery on his campaign promises, to come forth with controvertible facts”, the BSO media director said. BSO-Delta therefore, urged President Muhammadu Buhari not to relent on his vow to tackle corruption in government, political leadership and fabric of the society.
