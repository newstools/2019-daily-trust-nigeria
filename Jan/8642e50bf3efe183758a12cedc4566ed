Dangote Industries Limited (DIL) has denied the ownership of the truck that caused an accident in Iworoko Ekiti, in which 20 people were said to have died at the weekend. The management of DIL on Sunday issued a statement, frowning at the misleading and unverified report, carried by an Online medium, alleging that a Dangote truck, was responsible for the tragedy in Iworoko, near Ado Ekiti, where 20 lives were lost. Dangote wondered why some people rushed to the press without adequate verification, thereby reporting falsehood as it has been confirmed that the truck did not belong to Dangote, as reported by the medium. The statement stated: “While we commiserate with the families of the deceased and pray for God’s strength to bear the loss of their loved ones, it is important to state that the affected truck did not belong to our company. “Dangote Industries Limited (DIL) does not import or produce rice for the market or for any individual or entity. Our trucks are also not meant to carry third party goods as we have consistently requested the public to report any such illegal action by our drivers to us for monetary reward.” Dangote Group wins two sustainability awards Couple, 5 others crushed to death in Ogun ...as irate mob attacks Dangote trucks One-on-one with graduate truck drivers
