Some aggrieved members of Bayelsa State Chapter of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), have threatened to defect ‘en masse’ to another political party before the general elections billed for first quarter of 2019. This is as a result of the ongoing crisis rocking the party after the fallout from the primaries held in October of 2018. A member of a group, ‘PDP Stakeholders and Loyal members in Bayelsa State’, Amb. Kenny Sotonye B. Fiseye, from Yenagoa constituency III, in a statement on Saturday, said that they decided to challenge the conduct of the last PDP primaries in the state because normal electoral procedures were not adhered to. Fiseye, who refused to state the particular political party they may defect to, called on relevant party leadership to correct the injustices in the party and the legitimate grievances of aggrieved members. He added that some aggrieved members have instituted a legal case at the Federal High Court in Abuja. He said “At a time the PDP is gaining momentum and experiencing a rebound nationally, it is unfortunate that Bayelsa state leadership is balkanizing the party into oblivion, this state has been one of the strongholds of PDP and we want it to continue to be, that is why we insist that the right thing be done”. The State Chairman of PDP,  Moses Cleopas could not be reached, but the party’s Publicity Secretary, Osom Macbere, was quoted in a report recently as describing the them as group of ‘confusionists’. Macbere  had also insisted  that all party members were carried along during the congress and Governor Dickson at no time influenced the process.
