A Civil Society Organisation has asked a Federal High Court in Abuja to make an order compelling President Muhammadu Buhari and others to dismiss Engr Louis Edozien from service. The Incorporated Trustees of the Civil Society Observatory for Constitutional and Legal Compliance (CSOCLC) claims that Edozie, who is the Permanent Secretary in the Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing did not participate in the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) as provided by law. In the originating summons filed on its behalf by its counsel, Nnamdi Nwokocha-Ahaaiwe, the CSO submits that Edozie’s appointment, without an NYSC Discharge or Exemption Certificate, is in breach of sections 11 and 16 of the National Youth Service Corps Act and therefore illegal, unlawful, null and void. The CSO wants the court to make an order compelling the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami (SAN); the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha; the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, Winifred Oyo-Ita and the Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola to dismiss Edozie forthwith. The CSO also wants the court to order the Nigerian Police to investigate and calculate all the remuneration, salaries, emoluments, financial and other benefits obtained and received by Edozie in the course of his appointment as “an Executive Director of the Niger Delta Power Holding Company Ltd. (NDPHC) and Permanent Secretary in the Civil Service of the Federation”, and recover said sums from 1st Defendant and pay said recovered sums into the account of the agency and “the Federation Account with the Central Bank of Nigeria respectively subject to such deductions to offset expenses and costs as the Court may approve.” No date has been fixed for hearing.
