Vice Presidential candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, (APGA), Chief Jerry Chukwueke, has reiterated the commitment of his party to eradicate poverty in Nigeria if voted into office in 2019. Speaking while receiving the joint groups of Imo Traders, Drivers and Tricycle Operators Association, in his country home, in Owerri, Chukwueke, he described poverty as the common denominator among the Nigerian masses irrespective of their geo-political locations or religious affiliations, pointing out that it is at the roots of disaffection and avoidable clashes among Nigerians. He pointed out that it is only a John Gbor/Jerry Chukwueke government that can save Nigeria from imminent collapse. The Vice Presidential Candidate said that an APGA government will introduce economic zones in every zone of Nigeria to fast track the country’s economic growth. He also affirmed the commitment of the party to ending the ceaseless herder/farmer clashes and the threats posed by Boko Haram insurgency in the country and ensure the safety of Nigerians wherever they choose to live. The APGA VP candidate said that but for some selfish reasons, APGA would have been the ruling party in the state if Governor Rochas Okorocha, who was elected under the party, did not dump it.
