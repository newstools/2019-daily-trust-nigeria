Governor Dankwambo urged the Christian faithful to learn from the lessons of Christmas, which exhibits sacrifice, selflessness and love for each other irrespective of religious and ethnic differences, “this should be the yardstick that should guide us to build a prosperous state worthy of emulation.” He said: “We must not forget that all of us are created by Allah and should learn to cultivate harmonious relationship with each other. “I also congratulate all of us on the occasion of the New Year 2019 and urge us to imbibe the spirit of tolerance, understanding, hard work, sincerity and honesty in all our dealings.” 2019: Dankwambo tasks monarchs  on peace ‘It’s impossible to uproot PDP in Gombe’ 2019: Buhari preaches peace in Gombe
