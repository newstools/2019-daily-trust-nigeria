Consumer Confidence soared by 3.5-points in the Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) to stand at 64-points in fourth quarter of 2018 from 60.2 points obtained in the third quarter of the year. The NOIPolls Consumer Confidence Index released, yesterday, measured how optimistic or pessimistic consumers are regarding their present and future economic prospects. The report stated that the increase in the CCI suggests that the spending pattern of Nigerian households increased in fourth quarter of 2018. “Although the CCI helps in measuring the degree of optimism consumers have about the economic situation, it is worthy to note that consumers may exaggerate certain aspects of the economy. Therefore, concerned stakeholders are always advised to monitor the Consumer Confidence,” the report stated. Furthermore, the Present Situation Index (PSI) declined while the Expectation Index (EI) experienced an increase; these are the two variables that make up the CCI. The PSI declined by 3.4-points from the results obtained in Q3, 2018 to stand at 38.3  points in Q4, 2018, contrarily, the EI increased by 7.0 points from the 84.2 points obtained in Q3, 2018 to stand at 91.2 points.
