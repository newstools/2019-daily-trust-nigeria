Former Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos, Hon. Moshood Salvador  has said the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) would double the number of votes it recorded in the 2015 election. Salvador also predicted victory for the APC in the presidential election, saying the PDP candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar does not have the clout to defeat the incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari. Speaking in Lagos on Saturday at the launch of the Presidential Support Committee for Buhari/Osinbajo 2019, Salvador who is now a chieftain of the APC, said going by his analyses of the voting patterns especially in the north, Buhari stands the best chance to be returned. He said the presidential support committee under the auspices of the presidency would mobilize massively for Buhari ahead of the 2019 presidential election slated for next month. He said: “There is no doubt about the victory. It is an all-round landslide victory. The Lagos state governor will win twice the amount of votes he had in the last election this time around. “The president is going to win landslide without any iota of doubt in it. When we talk about voting capacity, north-west has about 18.9 million votes, South-West has 14.2 million votes. “Add South-West and North-West it gives about 33 million. If you add other two zones, they are not what you will get in the other two zones. More so go to North- East has 12 million votes, you will realize that out of the six states, five are APC states so how is it possible for Atiku to get over that one. It is a very difficult task for him”. Salvador, as chairman of the opposition PDP, dumped the party for APC where he was later made the DG of Buhari/Osinbajo Group in Lagos. He defected with over 30,000 members of his Conscience Forum.
