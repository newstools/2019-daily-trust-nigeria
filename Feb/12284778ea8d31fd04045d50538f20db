The Chief Legal Officer, Jade Internet Services, Mr Seyi Oni, has said that the purported arrest by the police of Jumia Food’s Managing Director, Mr. Guy Futi, was fabricated and untrue. In a press statement yesterday on behalf of the management of Jade Internet Services, owners of Jumia Food, Oni said that a report that Mr Futi was arrested by men of the Nigerian Police Force, Zone II, for fraud allegation and conversion of company’s funds for personal use was a mere fabrication. “The current Country Manager of Jumia Food Nigeria, Mr, Guy Futi, neither misappropriated the company’s funds nor converted them for personal use. If this had happened, Jumia would have taken legal action against him, and probably involved the press. “He was never involved in any fraudulent act. Mr Futi was invited for questioning by the Nigerian Police Force on Thursday January 31, 2019 in relation to an ongoing case of fraud filed by Jumia Food against one of its vendors, Castle Logistics Services. According to Oni, Mr Futi was never detained by the police, saying he was only invited for questioning and left the station after the interrogation same day. “At the time the incident for which Jumia took a legal action against Castle Logistics occurred, Mr. Futi had not joined the company. The allegation of fraud by Castle Logistics is thus a malicious attempt to distract Jumia Food from carrying out a legal action against the company,” he said.
