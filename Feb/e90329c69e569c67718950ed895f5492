The acting director of the Secondary Education Board (SEB) in the FCT, Mrs. Nanre Emeje, has urged youths to remain focus and be patriotic in all their dealings wherever they found themselves. Emeje, who gave the advice after she was conferred with an award by a youth group, African Youth For Peace Assembly (AYPA) in Abuja last Friday, also advised them to shun social vices that are capable of destroying their future dreams. She further urged them not to allow themselves to be used to create violence and chaos during the election period, even as she said she was passionate about young people as they constitute large percent of society’s population. The FCT SEB director noted that the youth cannot be ignored, saying their age was the critical time to take decision and direct their destiny. She, however, added that the youth cannot develop intellectually, mortally, emotionally, psychologically except through sound education, hence, the board’s efforts to ensure successes were recorded in education sector in FCT. She commended the youth group for conferring the award on her, saying such award would further challenge her to work harder in the discharge of her duty. Earlier, the executive secretary of AYPA, Comrade Yakubu Michael, while presenting the award, said it was in recognition of the acting director’s commitment to work  and remarkable contribution towards the education sector in the territory. He noted that the various activities under the acting director in the education sector of the FCT had enhanced the quality of service in teaching and learning process in the FCT secondary schools.
