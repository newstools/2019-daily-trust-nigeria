The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kwara state has rejected and called for the cancellation of the results of last weekend’s presidential and national assembly elections in the state. State chairman of the party, Engr Kola Shittu made the call at a press conference in Ilorin, the state capital on Thursday. He said the party was ready to employ every legal means to redress what he termed manifest irregularities which he alleged characterised the elections across the state’s three senatorial districts. Shittu who was flanked by other executive members of the party, said the elections were marred by electoral malpractices, malfunctioning of 90 percent of card readers, multiple voting as well as over- voting. “We call on INEC to cancel the election because its outcome does not reflect the wishes of the people”, he said. He added that:”We also received report of how APC agents made use of unclaimed PVCs to vote at some polling units across the State particularity within Kwara Central. Also, many of the local observers accredited by INEC to monitor the election were APC members.” “Additionally, prior to the day of the election, the Federal Government backed APC made some retrogressive and undemocratic moves, using state apparatus to intimidate and arrest some of our members and supporters in some parts of the state.” Asked if the party was ready to approach the tribunal for reprieve, the PDP boss said once a political party announces its dissociation from an election result there are procedure for such party to pursue.
