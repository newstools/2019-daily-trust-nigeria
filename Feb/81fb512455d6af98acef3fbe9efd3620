The Chairman of Abaji Area Council, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, has donated relief materials to fire victims at Pandagi village of the council. City News learnt that a mysterious fire gutted some huts belonging to Hausa dry season farmers at the community on Tuesday afternoon and destroyed their valuables. Ajiya, while presenting the relief materials, which included bags of guinea corn, millet, maize, rice, cartons of seasoning cubes, bags of salts and jerry cans of palm oil, expressed shock and sadness over the fire incident. He sympathised with the victims, saying he received the sad news about the fire incident while he was away in Abuja, even as he prayed that no life was affected by the inferno. The chairman promised to provide them with a more conducive shelter, even as he advised the victims to ensure they cleared the surrounding bushes to avoid a reoccurrence. The leader of the Hausa residents in the community, Suleiman Adamu, while narrating how the fire incident occurred, said they were in the farm when a native of the community ran to inform them of the fire outbreak. He said before they ran back home, the fire had already burnt down all the huts they erected, saying valuables such as clothes, water pumping machines, undisclosed sum of money and food stuff all got burnt to ashes. “It was exactly 12:34 pm while we are on the farm, but we thank God that no life was lost and we also thank the native of the community who responded to evacuate some little belongings inside the huts,” he said.  5 drown in Abaji boat mishap Abaji boss donates N3.3m to fire disaster victims Page 19
