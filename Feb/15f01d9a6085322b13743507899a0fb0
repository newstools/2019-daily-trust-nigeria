The presidential candidate of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar, has asked an FCT High Court for an order stopping President Muhammadu Buhari and security agencies from alleged interferance with the general elections. Atiku sought the order in a statement of defence he filed against a defamation suit instituted against him by the Buhari Campaign Organization (BCO). In his counter-claim against the suit, Atiku sought an order of court ‎”mandating President Buhari and his agents including security operatives and officers to abide by the rule of law and the principle of separation of powers entrenched in the constitution and should not intervene in the forthcoming elections.” Atiku, through his counsel, Chukwuma-Machukwu Ume (SAN), challenged the competence of the suit and urged the court to grant an order mandating President Buhari to apologise to him for filing a frivolous suit against him. ‎Atiku who asked for N2 billon as damages, said part of the money should be given to IDP camps across the country and the rest be used in equipping libraries and information technology centres for all state Universities in Nigeria. In a 56-paragraph witness statement on oath deposed by one Abraham Udoh, the former vice president ‎told the court that Buhari had failed Nigerians by his inability as a president to stop ‎the ruthless and wanton killings that rendered citizens, farmers, women and children homeless without food or basic amenities. The case will come up for hearing on March 7. ‘Mama Taraba’: Another governorship ambition scuttled? The choices before Atiku How Atiku emerged as Buhari’s main challenger
