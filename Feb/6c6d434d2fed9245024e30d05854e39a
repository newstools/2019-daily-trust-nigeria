A former Speaker of Old Kaduna State House of Assembly, Sen Mamman Abubakar Danmusa, has said it is not fair to campaign for the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari giving the abject hunger, poverty and insecurity that has taken over the nation. Addressing newsmen in Katsina on Tuesday, Danmusa said having campaigned for Buhari in 2007, 2011 and 2015, it will be out of place to re-campaign for him in 2019 having plunged the country into the present condition. On security, he said, the situation is deteriorating by the day noting that “it has become so bad that people had to organise themselves in the night to defend themselves.” “The insecurity was restricted to Northeast but today the whole Northwest is engulfed by armed robbery and kidnappings, both on our high ways, in homes and even in our markets,” he said. He added: “In my hometown Danmusa, our market is one of the biggest in the state. It is now deserted. Businessmen who used to come from afar are no more coming because of kidnappers.” He said, the so-called agricultural revolution is a mirage in Katsina saying that “rice farmers are in debt and monies invested by CBN cannot be recovered” On corruption fight, Danmusa chided the federal government for failing to disclose looters’ names and amount recovered in its ongoing fight against corruption saying that “the Transparency International rated the country low as far as corruption is concern and the fight is one-sided.” “For me, under this situation, President Muhammadu Buhari does not deserve to be given another second chance,” he added.
