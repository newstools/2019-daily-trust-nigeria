A former governor of Kano state, Malam Ibrahim Shekarau on Wednesday said he is not afraid to face Senator Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso’s anointed candidate, Alhaji Sani Madakin Gini in the February 16 poll. Addressing a press conference today, Shekarau said the electorate would decide between him and the Kwankwaso’s anointed candidate, Madakin Gini. He said: “I joined politics to serve the humanity and being a former governor that served the state for eight years, I know the yearnings and aspirations of my constituents. I am not bothered to allow the constituents to decide. “I wish Kwankwaso will contest for himself then we will slug it out. Kwankwaso is an absentee senator. He has never set his foot in Kano for the past three and a half years. He has never met with his constituents within this period.” Shekarau expressed hope that he would defeat Madakin Gini in the forthcoming Saturday’s election.
