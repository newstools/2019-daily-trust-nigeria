A Group,  the El-rufai Progressives Group, has cautioned the youths against engaging in political violence as the country approaches general elections in the country. The Group’s Convener. Comrade Muktar Muhammed,  made the call during a rally to sensitize the electorate, particularly youths, on the need to participate in the forthcoming elections. He said youths, as leaders of tomorrow, must also desist from selling their votes  because doing so will affect their future. Muktar also advised the youths against involvement in any act capable of causing violence before or after elections in the state. “We are only out to sensitize our youths to desist from political thuggery or engaging in creating violence on election day. It’s also wrong for our youths to sell their Permanent Voters Card (PVCs). When you sell your PVCs  you have mortgaged your future for another four years,” he said. Muktar also urged the voters to come out en masse ‎to vote for Governor Nasir El-Rufai due to his contributions towards developing the state. He said El-Rufai has achieved lot in the area education, Health and infrastructural development.
