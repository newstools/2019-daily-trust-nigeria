A light plane crashed in Kenya’s Great Rift Valley region on Wednesday, killing five people including three Americans, a police source said. Witnesses saw the plane clip a tree as it attempted an emergency landing and crashed in a field in Kericho county west of the capital Nairobi. The Kenyan pilot and another passenger, of unknown nationality, also died, the police source said. “The plane clipped the tree and the rear wheels came off,” said farm worker Joseph Ng’ethe. “It then careened and crashed into another tree in front and into the ground.” ‘Cuban plane crash killed all 68 on board’ Villagers find crashed Indonesian plane Plane crashes in South Sudan, witnesses say dozens killed
