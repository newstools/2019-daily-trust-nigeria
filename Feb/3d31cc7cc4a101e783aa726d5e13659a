More civilians were killed last year in Afghanistan than at any time since records have been kept, according to a new report from the UN. There were 3,804 civilian deaths in 2018, including 927 children, the highest recorded numbers in the country’s long-running war. The Afghan war began after US forces led a campaign to overthrow the Taliban in the wake of 2001’s 9/11 attacks. The report comes a day before the next round of talks to end the conflict.
