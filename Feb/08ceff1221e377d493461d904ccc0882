Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has warned security agencies including DSS, police, and the military not to kill ballot box snatchers in the forthcoming general elections. The governor argued that obeying President Buhari’s directive that security agents should deal ruthlessly with whoever snatched ballot boxes would amount to extra-judicial murder which could lead to prosecution at the International Criminal Court (ICC). Addressing a press conference yesterday in Abuja, the governor said the military and other security agencies must stick to the rules of engagement during the elections, adding that he was not in support of ballot box snatching but that due process must be followed in dealing with those who committed infractions. “I know that the APC is planning to give soldiers and other security agencies to APC supporters to intimidate others. We are not going to accept this. “Let it be known to every Nigerian that some of us are prepared to spill our last blood to ensuring that this democracy is sustained for the sake of Nigerians. “A government that was elected democratically is gradually turning into dictatorship. It is unfortunate for our own president to come out and disregard the provisions of the laws of the land and give orders for extra-judicial killings in the state and torture against innocent Nigerians,” Ortom said.
