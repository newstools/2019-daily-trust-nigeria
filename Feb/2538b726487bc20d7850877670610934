The crisis at the Ikota Shopping Complex, Lagos, that left over 3000 shop owners without electricity supply since January has landed a tailor in trouble. The tailor, Afolabi Samuel, was yesterday charged with a two-count criminal charge bordering on misconduct likely to cause a breach of the peace. Police prosecutor, Friday Mammah, alleged that on February 26, 2019, at about 4.20pm at HFP Properties Limited’s office, No. J15, Ikota Shopping Complex Ajah, Samuel and two others now on the run conducted themselves in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace by using a chain and a padlock to lock the HFP office, with the company’s staffers inside it. It was further alleged that the suspect, on the same date, time and place, threatened to stab one Ukaegbu Francis with a broken glass. Samuel pleaded not guilty and was admitted to N50,000 bail, with one surety. The trial magistrate, Miss T. A. Idowu, adjourned further hearing till March 27, 2019. City News learnt that trouble had erupted at the shopping complex over a debt of N180 million that about 3000 shop owners were owing Eko Distribution Company, which forced the Disco to disconnect the entire shopping complex. Some shop owners were understood to be owing N60,000 separately, while one owed as much as N11m. While some paid their bills, it was gathered, others did not. This forced Eko Disco to disconnect the entire 3000 shops. The disagreement among the shop owners over the disconnection was said to have led to the alleged misconduct by Samuel and others against some staff members of HFP, who are the facility managers of the shopping complex.
