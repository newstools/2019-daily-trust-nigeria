Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has promoted his son to the rank of lieutenant general – the second highest position in the army. Lt Gen Kainerugaba Muhoozi is considered a likely successor to 74-year-old President Museveni, but denies any immediate plans to enter politics. In the last six years, Lt Gen Muhoozi has been promoted three times and now sits one rank below President Museveni, who is a general. Although he has served as Commander of Uganda’s Special Forces, his critics have questioned whether his promotions match his military experience.
