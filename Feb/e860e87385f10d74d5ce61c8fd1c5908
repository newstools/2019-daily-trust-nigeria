Traditional rulers in Imo State have reaffirmed their endorsement of President Muhammadu Buhari for the 2019 presidential election. The monarchs had, at Isiala Mbano in April last year, endorsed the president for a second term in office. However, reaffirming their support in an interview with our correspondent, the traditional ruler of Ihim community in Imo State, His Royal Majesty, Eze Oliver Ohanwe, Gburugburu I, said that their reasons for endorsing Buhari had not changed. Ohanwe said that apart from the president’s dedicated service to the nation, his commitment to ensure common good for all and his unwavering drive for the peace, unity and progress of the country, Buhari was the only president that could ensure the emergence of Igbo president in 2023. He said: “We said it before and we are saying it again, Buhari is our choice for 2019 election. He is the only one that can ensure that an Igbo man becomes a president of Nigeria. We are prepared to vote for him on Saturday.” Igbo Presidency: 'We’ll withdraw support for Buhari if...' Igbos will vote for Buhari in 2019 - Eze Ohanwe Igbos’ll vote for Buhari in 2019 — Eze Ohanwe
