A former PDP governorship aspirant in Kwara State, Alhaji Abdulkadir Amir, has said the APC will win at all levels in the state. Alhaji Amir who made the prediction during a visit to Daily Trust yesterday, said the mass defection of PDP members in Kwara State signified the end of the Saraki dynasty. He said most of them defected to the APC to support the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari and to liberate Kwara State for the sake of future generations. “I hanged my aspiration because the party elders prevailed on us to withdraw from the race in the interest of Kwara State,” Abdulkadir said. He also noted that electioneering campaign was ongoing, saying they had sensitised the electorate to stand for the right thing during the elections. He said the defection of Saraki to the PDP opened a window for them to defect to the APC. “There was no development in the state; it was not even stagnation, but retrogression. Instead of Kwara to move forward, it was moving backwards. This is the time to move ahead,” he said.
