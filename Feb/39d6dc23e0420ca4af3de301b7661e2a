The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday rejected the results of last Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections being announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). This is even as results so far announced from 11 states and the FCT put President Muhammadu Buhari slightly ahead of PDP’s Atiku Abubakar. INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, adjourned this morning, adding that proceedings would continue today by 10am, beginning with Plateau State. The PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, who addressed a press conference yesterday in Abuja, described the figures being announced by INEC as “incorrect and totally unacceptable”. This was after the INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, had announced results from Osun, Kwara, Nasarawa, Ekiti states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Secondus said the PDP was in possession of results from all polling units across the country, adding that “INEC must live up to expectations.” He said the elections were manipulated in Nasarawa State to favour President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC), adding that PDP supporters were disenfranchised through the “cancellation and manipulation of figures.” Secondus said, “With the INEC IT server hacked by agents of the APC to manipulate results, we can with certainty state that results from the following polling units have, for example, been tampered with: “Sarkin Dawaki ward in Doma LGA,  Nasarawa state; Doka ward in Doma LGA, Nasarawa state; Agyaragin – Tofa ward 10, 000 illegal votes added to already announced results in Wurno LGA in Sokoto state.” He said the APC and the president dispatched high-ranking officials to coercively influence outcomes in different geopolitical zones in the country as results trickled in on the Sunday, February 24th, 2019, clearly putting the PDP in the lead. (Full statement on page 16) Results are valid – INEC INEC said that there is no basis for the PDP to reject the results of the presidential and National Assembly elections as results are being formally submitted at the National collation centre located at the International Conference Centre (ICC), Abuja. The Chief Press Secretary to the Chairman of INEC, Mr. Rotimi Oyekanmi, told Daily Trust last night that the commission is doing the right thing and would not want to join issues with anyone or party. “The results being announced are not full of errors, they are valid. We have not concluded the release of the results. We have just released 10 and we still have results of other states to declare. “So we will continue with what we are doing successfully and as expected of us, what we are doing is the right thing to be done,” Oyekanmi said. PDP working to truncate process – APC The All Progressives Congress (APC) said the PDP is doing its best to truncate the ongoing electoral process by rejecting the presidential results before the official announcement by the INEC. APC National Publicity Secretary, Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, who was contacted on phone yesterday, said the position taken by the PDP was not a surprise to the ruling party going by its earlier pronouncement that Alhaji Atiku Abubakar should be declared winner before the start of the results collation exercise. Issa-Onilu said, “We know they (the PDP) will reject it no matter what the result is. We are not bothered about that. We will like to take them up after the official release of the results if what they say is worthy of any response. “So, what we are waiting for is for INEC to announce the results and we go to the Next Level. These are people saying that Atiku should be announced even before the collation of the results started. So, how can you take such people serious? “APC is not reacting now. Campaign has stopped. Election has been held. The next thing is to wait for the results. They are doing their best to truncate the process. But they will not succeed.” The APC Presidential Campaign Council also advised the PDP presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, to put a call to President Muhammadu Buhari instead of what it called its illogical rejection of the election results. The PCC Director, Strategic Communications (Official Spokesperson), Festus Keyamo, in a statement yesterday, also advised the PDP not to sacrifice the country for personal ambition. Keyamo, who said it was obvious that the top hierarchy of the PDP was hysterical and nervous, urged them to calm down because it was the first time the former ruling party was sensing a massive loss of an election as opposition party. While urging INEC, Nigerians and international friends not to be swayed by ‘infantile antics’ of the PDP, he said the process of collation and announcement that was on-going should be done to its logical conclusion after which anyone who is aggrieved should take full advantage of the provisions of the law.
