A senior cardinal of the Catholic Church has admitted that he could have better handled sexual abuse allegations that were brought to him. Oswald Gracias, the Archbishop of Mumbai is one of four men organising a major Vatican conference on child abuse this week. We found two separate cases where the cardinal, who is tipped by some to possibly become the next Pope, is claimed to have failed to respond quickly or offer support to the victims. Victims and those who supported them say Cardinal Gracias did not take allegations of abuse seriously when they were reported to him. Indiaâ€™s Catholics say there is a culture of fear and silence in the Catholic Church about sexual abuse by priests. Those who have dared to speak out say it has been an ordeal.
