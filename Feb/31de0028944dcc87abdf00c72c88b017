A former president, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, yesterday expressed apprehension over the alleged discovery of pre-thumbprinted ballots in some parts of the country, saying it may affect credibility of the election. He equally asked INEC to respond to the discoveries and take precaution to curb electoral fraud. Obasanjo noted that it was inconceivable to think he would leave Nigeria over the election, saying he had left “purveyors of the fake news to God.” Obasanjo expressed his readiness to vote according to the dictate of his heart. “If the news of already thumb-printed ballot papers in Kano, I have also received news in Ondo today. I have received news from Ikorodu. If these are true, we have not heard anything like this before. I don’t want to say “Oh, have I not told you?” But it is sad if they are true.” “Maybe INEC will have to tell us how this happened. Maybe INEC will have precautions against this tomorrow because if people are thumbprinting, obviously, they want to make sure that those already thumb-printed ballot papers are used. If that happens, it will make nonsense of all INEC has prepared for, and all Nigerians are looking forward to.”   Discovery of 'thumb-printed ballots' may hamper polls' credibility - Obasanjo Fresh plots to  scuttle 2015 polls Does Jega’s argument add up?
