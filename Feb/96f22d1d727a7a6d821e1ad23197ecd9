Several accredited local observers have urged losers of the presidential and National Assembly elections to accept defeat with dignity. Tunde Bafunsho, spokesman for the observers under the aegis of Organisation of Justice for Equity Sustenance (OJES), who addressed a news conference, yesterday, in Abuja, also implored the winners to be magnanimous in victory, following the loss of the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar to President Muhammadu Buhari. Bafunsho, who said the postponement of the elections by INEC later turned out to be a blessing, stated that the processes leading to the election were far better than what the country had in the past. He hailed INEC for their immeasurable contributions to the success and rated the conduct of the elections 80 percent credible. The accredited observers said all stakeholders that participated in the elections performed their roles towards the sustenance of a credible, peaceful, transparent electoral process and democracy in Nigeria. He said, “Conducting elections anywhere is never an easy task, requiring the collective input of all stakeholders including political parties, security agencies, traditional rulers, religious leaders as well as the entire citizenry.” Buhari’s victory signifies acceptability of his leadership — Akeredolu ACF urges Atiku to accept people's will, congratulate Buhari Let Nigeria Win Tomorrow
