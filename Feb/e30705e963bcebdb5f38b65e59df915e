The YG-Consult, a consortium of development professionals, has said Nigeria will among other benefits generate over four million jobs especially for the youth if the unexplored potentials of the rivers Niger and Benue are utilized. The coordinator of the group, and former minister of State for Health, Arch. Gabriel Yakubu Aduku, said this Sunday in Abuja at a news conference. He said while similar sized or smaller rivers were utilized by some other countries, Nigeria as a country should act now irrespective of previous failed attempts. According to him, the Niger and Benue confluence in Lokoja, for instance, could generate most of the electricity needed to drive the nation’s struggling industries. Aduku said rather than wait helplessly to suffer the effect of the annual overflow of River Nyos in Cameroun, the country can channel the overflow for irrigation purposes particularly in the northern part of the country where desertification is eating up arable lands year-in-year-out.
