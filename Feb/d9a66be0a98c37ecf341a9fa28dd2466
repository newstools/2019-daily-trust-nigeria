The PDP gubernatorial candidate in Kano State, Engr. Abba Kabir Yusuf, yesterday, expressed concern over alleged massive vote buying by the ruling APC that characterised the February 23 presidential election. The allegation was contained in a statement signed by Yusuf’s  spokesman, Sunusi Bature Dawakin Tofa. According to the statement, Yusuf who is the chairman, PDP Presidential Campaign Council in Kano State, said the ruling party had successfully achieved its plan of using money bags to get voted. “We saw it glaringly during the election, the APC chairman, Abdullahi Abbas and his cohorts, were buying votes at polling stations,” he alleged. Yusuf, therefore, advised INEC and the security forces to check the growing criminality of vote buying in accordance with the Electoral Act. #NigeriaDecides: PDP alleges massive vote buying in Kano Fierce contest for PDP as it tests APC dominance in Kano PDP bought votes during Osun gov’ship – APC
