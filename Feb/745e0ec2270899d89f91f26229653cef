A former governor of Kano State, Malam Ibrahim Shekarau, says he is not afraid to face Senator Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso’s anointed candidate, Alhaji Sani Madakin Gini, in Saturday’s contest for Kano Central senatorial seat. There were initial insinuations that Madakin Gini picked the PDP senatorial ticket to keep in trust for Kwankwaso who had vied for the presidential ticket of the party. However, Kwankwaso did not take over the ticket from Madakin Gini even after he was defeated at the PDP presidential primaries. Other sources said he was afraid of defeat in the event he faced Shekarau, hence his resolve to put his weight behind Madakin Gini. Addressing a press conference, yesterday, Shekarau said the electorate would decide between him and the Kwankwaso’s anointed candidate. “I wish Kwankwaso will contest himself then we will slug it out. Kwankwaso is an absentee senator. He has never set his foot in Kano for the past three and a half years. He has never met with his constituents within this period,” Shekarau claimed. The former education minister also dispelled rumours on the alleged sour relationship between him and President Muhammadu Buhari, saying “I am not aware of any disquiet between me and Buhari. Those insinuating it have never heard from either Buhari or myself that our relationship is not cordial.” Kano Central: I am not afraid of Kwankwaso – Shekarau Kano central contest: Shekarau, Kwankwaso in 4th political battle Tambuwal, Saraki, Kwankwaso, Dankwambo set for ‘Plan B’
