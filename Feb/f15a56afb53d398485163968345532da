The head of the ECOWAS Election Observation Mission (EOM) to Nigeria, former Liberian president Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, has expressed confidence in Nigeria’s ability to successfully go through the general elections. Sirleaf, who was briefing ECOWAS observers at the commission Headquarters in Abuja yesterday, said though the elections were coming on the heels of nagging security challenges and tensed political environment, it “not only constitutes an impetus in consolidating democracy in the most populous nation in Africa, but the outcome will also, to a large extent, impact on the socio-economic, political and security order of the region, given Nigeria’s strategic position and influence.” “It is with a deep sense of pride that election observation has become a norm and an integral part of the democratic process in the ECOWAS region, as well as the democratic values that underpin our regional organization. “The outcome of the mission, therefore, will undoubtedly serve as a yardstick to measure the credibility of the election. It is in this spirit that we should all see this onerous task as very important which should be diligently and meticulously done without compromise,” she added. She noted that the onus to hold peaceful, free and fair elections rests with the Nigerian people themselves, and expressed the hope that all political parties would conduct themselves in a manner that contributes to a peaceful, free, fair, credible and transparent election, as has been done previously in the country. In his remarks, the ECOWAS Commission’s Commissioner for Political Affairs, Peace and Security, Gen. Francis Behanzin, noted that despite the political will of the regional leaders and efforts of regional institutions, elections in West Africa had often been challenging with funding constraints and violence among others.
