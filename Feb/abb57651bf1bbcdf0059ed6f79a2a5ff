A middle-aged man, Peter Jamiu, has been arrested for allegedly defiling a 14-year-old girl by the riverside at Oworonsoki, Lagos. The girl was said to have been sent on errand by her mother on Saturday when Jamiu allegedly accosted her, dragged her to the waterside and forcefully had carnal knowledge of her. The police said the girl told them that that occasion wasn’t the first time the suspect would be defiling her but she couldn’t tell her parents because of the fear of stigmatization. A police source said that Jamiu was arrested at the instance of the Divisional Police Officer, Oworonshoki Division, Chief Superintendent Ifeanji Owo, who was said to have vowed to nab the suspect after listening to the complainant. A police source, who claimed to be among those who effected the arrest of the suspect, told our correspondent that investigation revealed that the suspect gagged the girl with a fishing net before he had his way with her. Doctors at Mirabel Centre were said to have confirmed that she had, indeed, been violated. When our correspondent visited the Oworoshoki police division on Saturday, the DPO was said to have gone for special operations on the visit of President Muhammadu Buhari to Lagos. The police source, however, confirmed the arrest, saying Jamiu had been detained inside the cell. The source said that the suspect may be transferred to the Gender Section of the Lagos State police command and consequently charged to court with defilement.
