The presidential candidate of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar, yesterday, promised to complete the Mambilla Hydro-Power project if elected. Atiku made the promise during a campaign rally in Jalingo, the Taraba State capital. He said the current administration was paying lip service to the project and had failed to pay compensation to the people, let alone mobilise contractors to site, also promising to pay attention to federal roads in the state. He stressed the need for all security agencies to remain neutral and provide a level playing field for all participants to avoid a chaotic situation. Atiku urged the electorate in Taraba to vote for him on February 16, and promised to provide projects for them. In his address at the rally, the PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, urged the people to vote for PDP for all the elective positions so that they could experience massive employment, peace and economic growth and stability. Atiku pledges to construct Mambilla Hydro power dam, if elected Atiku promises to renovate sea ports, completes all abandoned FG projects in Delta if elected Secondus warns INEC against rigging 2019 elections
