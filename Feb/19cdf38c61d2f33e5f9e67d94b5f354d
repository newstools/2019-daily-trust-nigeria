“The Information Technology (Industry) Association of Nigeria (ITAN) has urged the Federal Government to patronize only local companies that are properly licensed to practice Information Technology in the country. The National President of the association, Egnr Olutayo Adeniyi, made the call yesterday in Abuja at a news conference. According to him, while Nigeria has adopted a local content policy in the sector which requires that all ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) making IT goods and services procurements, must ensure that 30 percent is locally sourced, the policy is not fully implemented. “We call on governments to obtain the register of Licensed IT providers from the registry of Computer Professional Registration Council’s (CPN) and patronize only those companies that are properly licensed to practice IT in the country,” he said. He said that Nigerian economy can be made more competitive to provide jobs and generate wealth through a careful deployment and mainstreaming of ICTs in the critical sectors of the economy and society. The Vice President ITAN, Dr Yunusa Z. Yau, said that Nigeria has human capital skills to compliment the IT initiative, adding that the country does not lack the procurement skills.
