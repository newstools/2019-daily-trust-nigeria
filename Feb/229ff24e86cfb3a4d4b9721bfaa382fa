Authority in charge of the Seme Command Of the Nigeria Customs Service, Seme Command has sealed Atlas Park, a private traiker park in the area over alleged exhorbitant fees which they collect from drivers. Before the closure, truck drivers were forced to pay a yet to be ascertained amount to the owners for the use of the only park. It was learnt that the trailer park located outside the buffer zone at Seme Krake point has been operating for years until it was shutdown on February 14, by the cusroms authority in the area. The Command Public Relations Officer l, Saidu Nuruddeen Abdullahi who confirmed the development said that the decision to shutdown the park was arrived at a meeting headed by the Controller Seme Command, Mohammed Uba Garba. He said that trailer carrying goods coming to Nigeria now make use of the official trailer park, which he said is free. He said that the gains is that truck drivers making use of the facility are not expected to pay anything, adding that the advantage is that it would force down market price of goods. “Before now truck drivers coming or exiting Nigeria do not have any other option but to use the only available park which is Atlas park. The effect of this is that drivers are put under undew pressure to exit the area in order to avoid paying dumorage “The approved park is free and once they do the needful by following the laid down rules for importand export it becomes easy for the goods to exit seamlessly” he added.
