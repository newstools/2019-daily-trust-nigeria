There are mixed reactions in Sokoto over the postponement of the general elections in Nigeria. A woman leader Hajiya Amina Aminu said it came as a rude shock to her as they were hitherto very enthusiastic and had mobilized other women
to come out and exercise their franchise. She added:“We are very disappointed and for now that’s all I can tell you.” A former Councillor, Alhaji Umaru Mohammed Abdullahi of Tuntube/Tsefe ward said” it was the same scenario in 2011 and 2015 but all turned out as blessing to the country.” He added that  ” It is another sign of good things happening to this country.” He prayed for peace and safe conduct of the next week elections. A youth, Buhari Usman Digar Agyare was of the opinion that people should take things easy since they can’t help it. “It is something one cannot change so why worry oneself over it.”
Dahiru Musa,56 said the development could not be unconnected to the security situation in the country. He expressed sadness that he still has to wait for another week before he cast his vote, stressing that he wished to see the end of the national exercise for him to continue with other equally important things. He however prayed for peaceful elections across the country. A farmer Aliyu Nasiru simply urged Nigerians to continue to pray fervently for God’s intervention in achieving peaceful and credible
general elections in the country. Mixed reactions trail election postponement ‘Postponement of February 14 polls justified’ The cost of election postponement
