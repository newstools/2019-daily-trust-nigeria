The top prosecutor in the Maldives has filed money-laundering charges against Abdulla Yameen over allegations the former president received one million dollars stolen from state coffers in the country’s biggest-ever corruption scandal. The charges, which carry a jail sentence of up to 15 years, were filed on Wednesday, according to a spokesperson for the prosecutor general’s office. Yameen, 59, who suffered a decisive defeat in last year’s presidential election, has denied any wrongdoing. During his tenure, more than $79m obtained by the Maldives tourism board from leasing islands for tourism were diverted to private accounts, cashed out, and used to bribe politicians.
