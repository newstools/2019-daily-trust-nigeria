The Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki, yesterday assured the people of Kwara-north that their zone will produce the governor of the state in 2023. Though, the state’s chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with stakeholders from the north on power shift to the zone in 2023, Saraki, who is the national leader of the party, spoke on the pact for the first time yesterday. He endorsed the pact between the PDP and Kwara north stakeholders at the palace of the Emir of Gwanara, in Baruten Local Government Area of the state, Alh Sabi Idris Kotokotogi II, during his campaign tour of the area. Saraki said: ‘We have commitment to Kwara north and In sha Allah in 2023 governorship of the state will come to Kwara north. Ilorin and Kwara north have always been together and we shall continue to be together. “This year’s election is important not to only the people of Gwanara, or Kwara but Nigeria as a whole. Things are very difficult generally in the country and we all need to be Atikulated to get Nigeria working again. “ The Senate President blamed the non-construction of the Ilesha- Gwanara road on what he called the uncooperative attitude of the All Progressives Congress(APC) led federal government, assuring the monarch that the road  would be constructed once the PDP returns to power . Responding, the Emir of Gwanara, Alh Sabi Idris, who broke down in tears while recalling his relationship with the late Dr Olusola Saraki, declared his people’s unflinching support for Saraki political dynasty.
