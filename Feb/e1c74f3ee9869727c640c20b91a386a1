Kwara State Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed has assured residents of the state of safety before, during and after the elections. Speaking during the State Security Council meeting yesterday, Ahmed urged residents to conduct their lawful activities and come out en masse to elect leaders of their choice without fear as adequate arrangements were in place for their safety. According to him, while voters should be vigilant and ensure their votes count, they must do so within the ambits of the law and electoral regulations. He said nobody would be unlawfully arrested or harassed by any security agency on account of their political affiliation or party membership. Ahmed urged parents and guardians to keep their underage children away from the vicinity of polling areas to prevent them from being co-opted into unlawful activities during the elections. Security agencies, he added, had been mandated to clamp down on thugs, cultists and other criminals so that eligible voters could exercise their franchise in peace and safety.
