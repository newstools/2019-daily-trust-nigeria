Senator Philip Tanimu Aduda, representing the FCT, has urged the people of the territory to expect more viable projects from him that will impact on their lives. Aduda gave the assurance while addressing newsmen in Abuja, yesterday, to appreciate the people of the FCT for electing him for a 3rd term. He said as soon as the 9th Senate was inaugurated, his major focus would be to continue with the good work for the people of the territory, especially provision of infrastructure to communities that had not benefited before. Aduda also said he would promote peace and unity of the people of the FCT by carrying everybody along. “By the special grace of God there are places that I have not touched in terms of projects, which is the reason why I sought for re-election, so that I can ensure that communities that have not gotten some of the projects, are carried along this time,” he said. He said he was overwhelmed by the resilience of the people of his senatorial district, and also praised his opponent and other candidates that contested with him at the polls for their maturity. “In fact, my opponent were all wonderful, maybe, if they had not contested the elections, I would have not known the level of my popularity in the FCT but again let me say my constituents have not surprised me because they have always assured me that they are with me,” he added.
