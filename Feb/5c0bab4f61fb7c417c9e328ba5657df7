The Education Secretariat of the Federal Capital Territory Administration ((FCTA) has ordered an internal investigation into the alleged child abuse at the Abuja School for the Deaf in Kuje Area Council. In a statement on Wednesday, the Assistant Director (Information) of the secretariat, Mr. Anthony Ogunleye, expressed concern over the allegation. Mr. Ogunleye said, “The attention of the FCT Education Secretariat has been drawn to the alleged abuse of a pupil of the Abuja School for the Deaf, Kuje, as broadcast by an Abuja-based radio station. “The Secretary for Education is deeply concerned by the very serious allegation, especially since the well-being of a minor is concerned. “While the highly emotional broadcast has prompted an investigation by the police, the secretary has also ordered an internal investigation into the matter.” He said while the secretariat awaited the outcome of the investigation by the law enforcement agencies, the management assured all parents and guardians that their children and wards were safe in their various schools. “We, therefore, enjoin them to remain calm and all inquiries can be sent to either the Secretary for Education or the Chairman of the FCT Universal Basic Education Board (UBEB),” Ogunleye said.
