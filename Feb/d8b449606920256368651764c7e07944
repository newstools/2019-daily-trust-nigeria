The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in yesterday’s election, Atiku Abubakar has expressed optimism that he will win, following the results that have trickled in so far. Atiku, a former Vice President, however, asked his All Progressives Congress (APC) counterpart, President Muhammadu Buhari to prevail on some bigwigs in his party to ensure that nothing went wrong in the collation process. In a statement, Sunday, by his Special Assistant On Public Communication, Mr. Phrank Shaibu, Atiku commended Nigerians for turning out in their large numbers to vote for him. He said the initial indications from the PDP’s Simultaneous Vote Count (SVC) showed he would win the poll. “I would like to sincerely thank the millions of people who, despite having to bear the additional burden of a postponed election, came out yesterday to vote for me and the other PDP candidates standing in this election. “With strong shares of vote in SS, SE as well as an increased share in SW and NC, we are very pleased with the progress the PDP has made. “We look forward to sharing some exciting news in other parts of the country very soon, which will confound all the armchair pundits. “The people of Nigeria can take solace that very soon, the living nightmare of the last four years will come to an end so that together, we will get Nigeria working again,” he said. Atiku urged Nigerians to maximise their eternal vigilance in the next 48 hours to prevent the majority votes recorded at the polling units being “disrupted by force” by the APC at the collation centres.
