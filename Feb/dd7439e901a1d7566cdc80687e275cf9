At least 49 female candidates are to compete for elective positions across various political parties in the 2019 gen-eral elections in Niger State. The statistics supplied by INEC shows that the polls at every level will be dominated by the men with the women representing a small fraction of the candidates’ population. The record puts them at a serious disadvantage against their male counterparts, with 546 candidates, even as only a few of them are flag bearers of the ruling APC. According to the statistics, out of the 31 candidates vying for the governorship, only two are female, while 29 males are contesting for the deputy governorship against seven represented by the opposite gender. Similarly, 37 males would be slugging it out for the three senate seats across all the zones in the state with only three females in the race. Daily Trust observed that the number of female candidates slightly increased for the House of Representatives seats; with nine scaling the primaries of their parties for the 10 seats against their male counterpart’s 177. For the 27 House of Assembly seats, out of the 361 candi-dates fighting for the slots, 343 are male, while 28 are fe-male. The Resident Electoral Commissioner, Prof. Sam Egwu, said the names of all the candidates would be reflected on the ballot papers accordingly. 2019: Why female candidates are not enjoying media publicity 1,515 young Nigerians to contest for Senate, Reps polls Where have the women politicians gone?
