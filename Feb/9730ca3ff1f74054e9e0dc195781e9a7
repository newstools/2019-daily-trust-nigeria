North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has departed for Hanoi by train for talks with US President Donald Trump. He arrived at the Chinese border city of Dandong after 21:00 local time (13:00 GMT) on Saturday. The much anticipated second US-North Korea summit is scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday in the Vietnamese capital. It follows a historic first round of talks last year in Singapore. All eyes will be on what if any progress is made towards “denuclearisation”. The departure, confirmed by North Korean state media, is the first official acknowledgement that the talks are taking place. The state media report said Mr Kim would pay a “goodwill” visit to Vietnam as part of the trip. He is thought to be travelling with his sister Kim Yo Jong and one of his key negotiators, former General Kim Yong Chol. Kim agrees to Trump summit ‘as soon as possible’ Trump lauds N.
