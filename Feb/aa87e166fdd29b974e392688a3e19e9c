Over 50 members of the National Youth Service Corps said to be on ad-hoc duty have been stranded at the Enugu state office of the Independent National Independent Electoral Commission (INEC), in Enugu town. The corps members were seen looking distressed as some of them lay on the ground, waiting for INEC officials to address them. Few of them, who spoke to our reporter but do didn’t want their names in print, said they were trained as ad-hoc workers and were asked to come to INEC head office in Enugu for posting. They said since Friday they had arrived at the commission’s office, saying (till the time of filing this report on Saturday), nobody has addressed them as they are stranded and may leave INEC premises. They said they were no longer finding the situation conductive, as their fate in uncertain. However, a top official of INEC said “we are working on instructions and directives from above. Once there is chance to fix them somewhere, we will do that fast.” “Stranded” election ad hoc officials besiege INEC office in Imo Uproar over replacement, exclusion of INEC ad hoc staff NYSC members decry maltreatment by INEC officials
