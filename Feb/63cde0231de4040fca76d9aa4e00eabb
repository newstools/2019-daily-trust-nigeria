Missing Kenyan activist Caroline Mwatha has been found dead, police have said. Ms Mwatha worked for the Dandora Community Justice Centre (DCDJ), documenting extra-judicial police killings on the Dandora estate in the east of the capital Nairobi. She disappeared last Wednesday and efforts to find her spawned the trending hashtag #FindCarolineMwatha. No more details about her death have been made public. Amnesty International had tweeted about its concern for Ms Mwatha on Monday and said it had still hoped to find her alive.
