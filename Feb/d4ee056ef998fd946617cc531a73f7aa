The Minister of Science and Technology Dr Ogbonnaya Onu has inaugurated a seven-man inter-ministerial committee to drive the process of sending a bill on the Executive Order 5 to the National Assembly. He said the committee is required to expedite the process of sending the document as a bill to the National Assembly for deliberation and subsequent assent by the president. The minister said the order will empower Nigerians to use their talents and skills like never before.  “It will also enable Nigerians to depend on our natural resources, be self-reliant, increase our GDP and also stop the importation of undesirable goods,” he said. The chairman of the committee, Mrs Yvonne Odu-Thomas, in her acceptance remarks, assured the minister they will come out with a credible drafty bill and deliver on time.
