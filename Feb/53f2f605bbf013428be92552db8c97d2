Zimbabwe President Mnangagwa retired four generals yesterday, in the first major shake-up of the armed forces since he took office and including the man who led a deadly crackdown against post-election protests in August. All four generals will be appointed to diplomatic posts overseas in line with Zimbabwe’s “critical global engagement and re-engagement strategy,” a government spokesman said. “Government will release accreditation details for each once various bilateral consu-ltations are concluded,” Mnan-gagwa’s chief secretary, Misheck Sibanda, said in a statement.
