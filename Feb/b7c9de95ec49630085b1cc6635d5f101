Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed has denied rumour making the round that he voted manually at his Polling Unit 006 in Oro, Irepodun LG in Kwara South, after the card reader failed to authenticate his finger print. The minister said the report was false and “is apparently sponsored by those who are on the verge of losing their political hegemony in Kwara State.” He said, he proceeded to cast his vote after his voter card was duly authenticated by the card reader, his fingerprints captured and his name and picture identified in the voters’ register.
