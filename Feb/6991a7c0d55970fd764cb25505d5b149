Ebonyi State Governor David Umahi says any officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission who rig the coming elections in the state will not leave alive. The governor also said that God would send angels to vote him if the civil servants in the state refused to do so. Addressing journalists in Abakaliki on Wednesday, Umahi said: “I want to beg that we don’t have violent elections; and in any case, if Mr. A wins and you announce Mr. B, no matter who you are, you will not go back alive. That is very important. “That is the way Ebonyi is. So, it is very important that whosoever that is coming should do a very determined job”. Umahi also charged the people of southeast to ignore the threat by the Indigenous People of Biafra to boycott the presidential election, saying “these people are lacking knowledge and facts and should be ignored. Nigerians must come out and vote, Ebonyians must come out and vote, Igbo must come and vote. We are still one indivisible Nigeria.” “I sit on this seat not by the will of man, but by the will of God, and if the civil servants say they will not vote for me and God sees my heart that l did not wrong them, he will send the angels to vote for me. Nothing moves me so far I do things with the fear of God,” the governor stated. The governor declared today a work-free day to allow people to travel back to their respective domains in readiness for the elections. 2019: No room for fake results, as masses are wiser - Gov.
