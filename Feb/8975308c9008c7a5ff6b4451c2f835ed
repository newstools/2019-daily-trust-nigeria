Switzerland, yesterday, congratulated all the candidates who signed the Peace Accord and called on them to keep to their word during and after the general elections. A statement by the Embassy of Switzerland in Abuja said the Abuja Peace Accord 2019 echoes the one signed before the 2015 presidential election in the presence of the late former United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan. The statement said, “At the request of Nigerian stakeholders and along with local and international partners such as the Kofi Annan Foundation and Clinton Foundation, the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs provided financial and technical support to the process that led to the signature of the Abuja Peace Accord. “The support provided is in line with Switzerland’s longstanding contributions and partnerships in the fields of conflict prevention and conflict resolution. “The presidential election holds high stakes for Nigeria: an electoral process that is perceived as credible and peaceful will be key for the elected government to further develop the huge economic, social and human potential of the country.” Switzerland, it said, commended the tireless efforts of the Abdulsalami Abubakar-led National Peace Committee and wishes Nigerians well on this momentous occasion.
