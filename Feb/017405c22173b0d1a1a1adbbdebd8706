A 42-year-old civil servant, Bernard Edun, has told a Badagry customary court in Lagos that his wife was asking for an end to their eight-year-old marriage because she didn’t want to have sex with him anymore. The wife, Ajoke, had filed a petition seeking for divorce on the grounds of beating, lack of care, no more love, threat to life, infidelity and no rest of mind against her husband. But Edun denied the allegations, maintaining that the main reason for their differences was his wife’s penchant attitude of denying him sex. Ajoke, a 32-year-old trader who lives at Ajara Topo, Badagry, said that no sooner had they settled after their marriage when her husband brought a child he had from another woman home. She said that her husband started an amorous relationship with other women, and she later saw another woman with two children for him, adding that because he wasn’t caring for his family, she resorted to hawking to survive with her baby. She also told the court that she returned home one day and saw a pregnant woman in their matrimonial home. When she asked for her identity, she said, the respondent resorted to beating her to the extent that she fainted, which she said led her to vacate their matrimonial home in 2015. According to Ajoke, one of the children she had for Edun passed away due to his “carefree attitude”, adding that he was always harassing and molesting her publicly. Dissolving the marriage, the court observed that the two parties had mutually agreed to the dissolution of the union. The court ordered Edun to pay a N5,000 monthly upkeep allowance for the only child in the marriage, while custody was giving to the wife. The court president, Sikirudeen Adekola, ordered that both parties can have unrestrained access to the child.
