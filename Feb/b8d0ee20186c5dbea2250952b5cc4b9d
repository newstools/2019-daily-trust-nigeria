Ogunkoya said the Muslim community would no longer “be deceived by the so called Muslims who identify with the religion only by name and for electoral benefits.” He said  “In the circumstance where we have Christian candidates who have the capacity to deliver good governance, and adequately show understanding and commitment to the rights of Muslims; definitely we will prefer such candidates to the ones who are Muslim by name and incompetent. He added that “We use this opportunity to call on all stakeholders in the electoral process to play the game according to its rules with a bid to ensure free, fair, peaceful and violent free elections.” 2019: Muslims give conditions to back Ogun gov candidates $2.1b arms deal: We were approached with $3m – CIO Concerns over Muslim/Muslim ticket in APC
