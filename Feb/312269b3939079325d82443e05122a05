The Lagos State Government has trained selected officers of its Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) as well as Local Governments on issues relating to procurement  and  contract awards. At the opening of the two-day Procurement Sensitisation workshop in Lagos, the state Head of Service,  Hakeem Muri-Okunola said the need for participants to have right exposure in the acts of procurement and contract awards cannot be over-emphasised. He said being vested with the privilege of being accounting officers comes with enormous responsibilities and that it is quite unfortunate that some MDAs and Local Councils in the State have had to face challenges in adherence to procurement policies largely due to insufficient knowledge. The General Manager,  Lagos State Public Procurement  Agency, Onafowote Fatai said consistent and  transparent procurement processes are at the heart of anti-corruption measures that are aimed at building people’s  confidence in today’s government. ‘Due  process can’t slow down budget implementation’ Taxation of contract and direct labour procurement of MDAs Re: Yar’adua’s FEC has  become a tender’s board
