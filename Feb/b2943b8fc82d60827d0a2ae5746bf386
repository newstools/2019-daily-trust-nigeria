The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Kaduna State Chapter, on Monday, said voters in the State were determined to send the State Governor Nasir El-Rufai packing from the government house. The PDP said all assessment had shown that the governor will be defeated in the next coming election in the state because the voters were disappointed in his leadership. Kaduna State PDP Chairman, Hassan Hyet, who disclosed this at a news briefing, said governor El’rufai’s style of leadership was a threat to democracy. He also said the governor’s decision to run a Muslim-Muslim ticket was received with mixed reactions across the state. “Electorates, security agencies, observers and the international community need to focus attention on the build up to the Gubernatorial Election in the State,” he said. The Chairman also said the state government kept raising false alarm on alleged but unfounded security challenges in the State to justify the deployment of security personnel to be used to intimidate voters, thereby paving way for altering or cancellations of results in areas he is very unpopular. The PDP Chairman also expressed concerns on the alleged recruitment of vigilante, also known as Kato da Gora by the state government to use them to intimidate and harass voters on elections day contrary to the fact that the outfit was not recognised by INEC as part of the security apparatus. 2019: Gang up against Buhari, APC will fail – El-Rufai Traders endorse El-Rufai for 2nd term El Rufai: PDP planning to disrupt elections
