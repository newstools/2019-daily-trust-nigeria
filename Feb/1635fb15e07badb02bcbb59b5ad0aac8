A former speaker of the Ekiti State House of Assembly, Hon. Femi Bamisile, says the comment by President Muhammadu Buhari instructing security agencies to deal “ruthlessly” with ballot snatchers during elections is an indication that the APC-led Federal Government has no plan to rig Saturday’s rescheduled presidential and National Assembly polls. The former speaker described what President Buhari said as “the most patriotic comment ever made by a sitting president in the country.” The APC chieftain, who is a House of Representatives candidate for the Ekiti South Federal Constituency II, predicted that Buhari and other candidates of the party would win in the state by 80 per cent. Speaking with journalists in Ado Ekiti, yesterday, Bamisile said: “The president didn’t give a shooting order the way former President Olusegun Obasanjo gave a shoot-at-sight order against OPC when he was president. “President Buhari only said those who snatched ballots will have themselves to blame. So, I stand 100 per cent behind him on this order. We are not in the 19th century when things were absurd. It is a barbaric act for anyone to snatch ballot boxes,” he said. “If anyone loses his life while attempting to snatch ballot boxes, he should have himself to blame. Nigerians should see elections as a process that comes and goes, and the nation will remain. Why is the PDP afraid?” Buhari: Snatch ballot box at the expense of your life Politics of 2015 Elections: Why Fayose Is Up In Arms Against Buhari Buhari reads riot act to political thugs, ballot box snatchers
