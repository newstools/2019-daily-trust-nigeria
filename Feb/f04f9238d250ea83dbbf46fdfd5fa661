The All Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader and Co-Chair of the party’s Presidential Campaign Council, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has described the postponement of the Presidential and National Assembly elections as painful. In a statement his Media Office released on Saturday and he personally signed, Tinubu, reacting to the postponement of the polls by one week, said he appreciated the enormity of the logistical challenge that confronted INEC and was pained that the Commission could not do the elections within the time allotted. He, however, said: “We are perplexed that INEC literally waited so late in the day to make known the obstacles preventing it from keeping faith to the election schedule. “INEC could have and should have given the nation more ample and earlier warning. This could have perhaps lessened the pervasive disappointment that we all now feel. It also would have helped people better order their steps.” Tinubu regretted reports of voters rising early to leave their homes to cast their ballots, only to be told upon arriving at their appointed polling stations that the election had been postponed. He said: “This should not have happened for it could well discourage people from coming out when the election takes place.” Kaduna: Reactions trail postponement of 2019 polls Financial experts lament polls postponement Tinubu and the ‘rational calculus of war’
