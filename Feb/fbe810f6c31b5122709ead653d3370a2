Attacks by gunmen on Maro village in Kajuru Local Government of Kaduna State have resulted in breakdown of law and order in many of the surrounding villages, extending to the neighbouring Kachia Local Government. Gunmen were said to have stormed Maro at about 5:30 am, razing many houses and attacking many of the villagers. A source in Maro said the armed men were more than 400 and that they came to the village very early with different types of weapons. “As I am talking to you, many have fled their homes and are hiding in the bushes,” said one of the villagers who called our correspondent. Confirming the situation, the Kaduna State Government, in a statement, said it received reports of renewed attacks in Kajuru and Kachia local government areas. It condemned the recourse to violence, and called on all communities to support the efforts to restore calm in the area. The statement, signed by the senior special assistant to the Kaduna governor on media, reads in part: “Today, the Kaduna State Government was briefed by security agencies of renewed attacks in Kajuru local government area, and in parts of neighboring Kachia LGA. “The Kaduna State Government has been assured that the security agencies are working assiduously to contain the situation. “The Government is saddened by these attacks, condemns the perpetrators and urges all residents of the area to support the security agencies in their efforts to protect communities.” Maro was one the villages that came under attack two weeks ago. The Police Public Relations Officer in Kaduna State, DSP Yakubu Sabo, when contacted, said he will get back to our correspondent on the issue.
