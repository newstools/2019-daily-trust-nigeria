The Nigerian Air Force says its Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation LAFIYA DOLE has destroyed an Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) training camp in northern Borno. Director of Public Information and Relations of the force, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, who announced this in a statement on Monday in Abuja, said that several suspected terrorists were neutralised at Malkonory. He said that the operation was on Sunday after Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft observed significant human activities with several structures, equipment and vehicles camouflaged under dense vegetation in the area used by the terrorists for training. “Accordingly, two Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Alpha Jet aircrafts were dispatched to attack the location, dropping their bombs successfully within the camp leading to massive fires and resulting in the neutralising of several terrorists. “Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) by own and allied ISR later revealed that the terrorists suffered heavy casualties as a result of the air strikes.’’ Daramola added that NAF, operating in concert with surface forces, would sustain its efforts to completely destroy all remnants of the terrorists in the North-East.
