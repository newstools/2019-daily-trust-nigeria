Edo State Police Command has assured the electorate, political parties and other stakeholders of fairness in providing security during this Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly election in the state. The Commissioner of Police in charge of election duty in the state, Mohammed Dan Mallam, stated this during ‘Operation Show of Force’ carried out by the various security agencies in the state on Wednesday. He warned those he described as trouble makers to stay away from the state and called on members of the public to come out to exercise their franchise freely. According to him, the show of force is a demonstration of the force’s readiness for the general election and to assure the people of the state that their lives and properties are safe. “We have been meeting with other sister security agencies to ensure that we give members of the public the confidence to exercise their civic responsibility without intimidation. “We visited the Central Bank of Nigeria with INEC officials and representatives of political parties where we inspected sensitive materials and everybody was satisfied. “We are warning possible trouble makers, either political thugs or whoever, to keep away from Edo state. Anybody who wants to truncate the peace we are enjoying in the state is going to be resisted with maximum force,” he said.
