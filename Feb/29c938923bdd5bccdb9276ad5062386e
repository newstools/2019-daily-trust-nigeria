Kogi State says it will begin enforcement of Produce Export Standards Act on cashew commodity in the state as part of measures aimed at addressing illegal activities and sharp practices in the cashew industry in the state. The Commissioner for Agriculture and Natural Resources, Mr Kehinde Oloruntoba who disclosed this yesterday at a press briefing in Lokoja, said the move was to ensure improvement in quality and value of cashew nuts from Kogi State at the international markets. He lamented that due to sharp practices and illegal activities in the industry, the annual revenue of the state from export of cashew nuts dropped from about N70 billion to N20 billion in 2018. He said in view of the standard enforcement, plucking of cashew produce before maturing; buying and/or selling of cashew produce at farm gates and buying and/or selling of cashew produce without licenses constitute offences henceforth. ‘Cashew farmers lose billions of naira in Kogi’ Kogi farmers want implementation of FG’s 10,000 hectares cashew plantation Cashew farmers face daunting challenges in Kwara
