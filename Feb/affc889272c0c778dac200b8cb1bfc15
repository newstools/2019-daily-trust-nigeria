The State Coordinator of Civilian JTF, Abba Aji Khali told Daily Trust at the scene of the attack in Maiduguri that one of the attackers was killed and his rifle recovered. ” This attack will not change any things, although 8 persons were killed and 15 others injured. We killed one of the attackers and one suicide bomber also died in the attack” Khali said the attack was meant to stop people from voting. “They cannot prevent people to come out or deter them from voting. I want to say that wherever they are hiding, we will get them and flush them out”.
