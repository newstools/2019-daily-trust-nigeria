The YIAGA-AFRICA Watching The Vote (WTV) situation room has called for high level security for INEC officials and election materials for the Saturday’s and other forthcoming elections. The Chair, Watching The Vote Working Group, Dr. Hussaini Abdu and the Executive Director, YIAGA-AFRICA, Samson Itodo, made the call on Thursday in Abuja, at the pre-election press conference and formal launch of the National Data Centre. They said that reports from its long-term observers in Anambra State regarding a fire in the INEC Headquarters in Awka is disturbing. According to them, the fire reportedly destroyed upwards of 4,000 Smart Card Readers and is the third fire reported in an INEC facility over the previous two-week period, apart from the fires which were also recently reported at the INEC offices in Abia and Plateau states. “YIAGA-AFRICA registers concern regarding this trend, and calls on state security forces to remain vigilant in providing adequate security for sensitive election materials and personnel,” Itodo said. According to him, the organisation is fully prepared to observe the 2019 presidential and National Assembly elections. “At present, all 3,076 PVT observers are sending in practice reports based on an election day scenario, which will be duly processed by the data clerks and data analysis teams. “YIAGA-AFRICA stands ready to observe the presidential elections on behalf of all Nigerians and to ensure that the people’s votes are accurately counted. “YIAGA-AFRICA calls on the citizens of Nigeria, the parties and candidates, INEC and the forces of law and order to also play their parts to ensure a peaceful, credible and inclusive process,” he added.
