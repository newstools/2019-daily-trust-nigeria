The Federal Government has said that the controversial dichotomy in the placement of HND and Degree holders in the federal civil service cadres has not been abolished. The Head of the Civil Service of the Federation (HoCSF), Mrs. Winifred Oyo-Ita, said this while presenting her three-year scorecard at a press conference in Abuja yesterday. “I think the issue of this HND and BSC Dichotomy came up at the last Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting, it is something a lot of people are still confused about and it should not be so. What was approved at FEC is that henceforth HND graduates who entered at the same level as degree holders will be on the same level at entry point in the civil service. “The issue of where they (HND graduates) stop will still remain at Grade Level 14 unless they are able to acquire additional relevant degrees that can now convert to them to officer cadre. We have explained this severally, but when people hear that BSC-HND dichotomy has been cancelled, everyone was jumping for joy as if  it is automatic that HND graduates will get up to Grade Level17 in the Public service. The issue still remains that HND holders still have to convert after having acquired relevant degrees, to the officer grade,” Oyo-Ita said. She also said that Federal Government has finally settled out of court with about 97 deputy directors who were aggrieved over the processes of the promotion exams conducted by the office of the Head of Service of the Federation. She said the government opted for out of court settlement to ensure the sustainability of achievements of the reform agenda in the public service. She said that to demonstrate government’s commitments to workers welfare, about 10,735 officers have been promoted through promotion and conversion between 2016 and 2018.
