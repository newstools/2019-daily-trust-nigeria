Nigerian Tier 1 lender, Zenith Bank Plc, yesterday, released its full year 2018 results to the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) which showed a marked improvement as Profit After Tax rose from N173 billion in 2017 to N193 billion in 2018. Consequently, the bank has declared a final dividend of N2.50 per share. A breakdown of the result shows that funding income grew 19% y/y. Operating expense and provisions declined y/y by -17% and -92% respectively (both surprised positively). On a full year basis, funding income growth was also strong, up 15% y/y to N295.6bn. The growth on this line was driven by a double-digit y/y decline in funding expenses as a result of a reduction in relatively more expensive time deposits. Zenith’s FY 2018 PAT also implies an ROAE of 24.5%, which is slightly higher than its 2018E guidance of 23.4%. Non-interest income declined by 32% y/y mainly due to derivative losses of –N16.8bn (compared with gains of +N68.7bn for FY 2017). Year-to-date, Zenith Bank shares have gained +8.2% outperforming the NSE ASI by around 6%. Zenith Bank is currently trading at N24.75 in today’s trading session, up 3.13%.
