The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in the Southwest has expressed concerns over some sensitive materials already moved to some states by the Independent National Electoral commission, INEC, calling for strict action to protect them. The party condemned the last minute postponement of the Presidential and National Assembly elections by INEC, saying the decision was based on a flimsy excuse of logistical crisis. In a statement signed by the zonal publicity director of the party for the Southwest, Mr Ayo Fadaka, the PDP said in view of the numerous declarations of its preparedness to prosecute the elections on the dates previously fixed by it, INEC had disappointed Nigerians. “It is important to state that the conduct of INEC, since the Buhari years, have been anything but satisfactory as it has always been shoddy in its preparations and execution of various bye-elections and isolated Gubernatorial elections. “This sloppiness must stop and INEC must be prepared to discharge its allocated responsibilities firmly on the new dates fixed for the elections,” it said. “We are also curious to know the classes of sensitive materials that have been allocated and distributed in some States and what actions are being taken to protect them. “For sure, we are aware that ballot papers have been distributed in some States in the North West Zone and some other places particularly in the North, thus we ask INEC what its plans are to safeguard them or outrightly change same nationally, the statement read.
