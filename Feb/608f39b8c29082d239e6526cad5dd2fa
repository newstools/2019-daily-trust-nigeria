The Ogun State government has said its continuous engagement with industries in the state on environmental protection and related issues has been yielding results as owners have been complying with environmental rules and regulations. The state Commissioner for Environment, Bolaji Oyeleye, disclosed this while commissioning effluent treatment plants (ETPs) in four industries owned by Sona Group in Sango-Ota. Oyeleye noted that with minimal enforcement, proprietors of industries had been able to comply and see the need for the plants, adding that they were now more aware of the need to invest their resources in protection of the environment for the benefit of all. “Upon assumption of office, I considered enforcement of statutory requirement for industrial facilities to put in place effluent treatment plant as a critical strategic action point. What we have witnessed is one of the outputs of this decision”, he said. Oyeleye called on other industries with production systems that generate liquid and gaseous waste to emulate the feat, describing investment on the environment as benefit of both the present and posterity.   The Group’s Chairman, Arjan Mirchandani, said government’s policy on the environment was encouraging, saying his companies would not hesitate to support government towards actualising its vision for a safer environment.
