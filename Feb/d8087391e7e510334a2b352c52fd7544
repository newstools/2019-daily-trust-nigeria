The Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) chairmanship candidate of the Peoples Trust (PT), Mr. John Bawa, has promised to improve the living standard of residents if he is elected. Mr. Bawa who spoke at the flag off of his chairmanship campaign on Wednesday, expressed disappointment that previous administrations of the council had not delivered effective governance to the people. He said the PT programmes for the people of AMAC, which included food security, improved educational standard and health, would have direct effect on the lives of the people. He noted that he had observed with interest how the people of AMAC had been misgoverned, which he said motivated him to do better when elected. Bawa said, “I have watched with keen interest and I have discovered that the people of AMAC, who are mostly indigenes, are still living in abject poverty despite the wealth of the council which could be better utilised if the right person is at the helm of affairs.” He said, 65 to 70 per cent of AMAC indigenes were farmers, but that there was still hunger in the council, saying farmers were not encouraged by the past and the present administrations of the council. He alleged that, “In the whole of AMAC, there is no single tractor to help in mechanised farming; no fertiliser to help our farmers grow their crops well and no extension officers that will go to the farmers to teach them modern ways of farming.” 2019: Aduda takes campaign to Utako market We’ll not allow APC take us unawares again - PDP chieftain AMAC APC candidate to open up rural areas
