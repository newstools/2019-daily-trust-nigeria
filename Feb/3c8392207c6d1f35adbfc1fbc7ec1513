The Oyo South Senatorial District candidate of the APC, Governor Abiola Ajimobi, has described this Saturday as a day of reckoning for the main opposition party, the PDP. He, therefore, urged leaders and supporters of the APC to remain steadfast and faithful to the course of the ruling party by ensuring that they come out in large numbers to vote for President Muhammadu Buhari to consolidate on the gains of the past four years. Addressing a stakeholders’ forum at the Western House, State Secretariat, the governor warned against complacency, adding that the desperation of the opposition to upset the applecart was unimaginable. Ajimobi who attended the National Executive Committee meeting of the APC in Abuja, said the national leadership of the party had given the state executive committees the marching order to go and reenergize the party’s campaigns. The governor said the APC was at peace with itself at the national and state levels, judging by the huge turnout at its campaign rallies and the insistence of the electorate not to be swayed by the opposition’s empty rhetoric.
