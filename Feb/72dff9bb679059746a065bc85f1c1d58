Over 10,000 volunteers are scrambling to become canvassers on Saturday in Asaba at the inauguration and commissioning of 4,000 across the 270 wards for President Muhammadu Buhari’s reelection on February 16. Organisers of the Buhari Door-to-Door Campaign Programme, the Mainstream Delta APC, did not envisage the massive turnout and had designed the programme to accommodate only 4,000 canvassers. But the mammoth crowd that thronged Grand Hotels, Asaba, venue of the inauguration, compelled the organisers to throw the doors open to allow teeming attendees into the 5,000 capacity Nnebisi hall. In his welcome remark, State chairman of the Mainstream Delta APC, Olorogun Cyril Ogodo said the development was an indication that President Buhari has come to stay till 2023. While commending Delta APC leader, Olorogun O’tega Emerhor for the vision, he hinted that other states APC leaders present at the inauguration had resolved to emulate Delta APC and replicate the campaign model in the rest states of the federation. “With barely a week to the presidential election, it is time to launch and canvass votes for Mr President. In 2015, we were handicapped and could do little so we got less than 50,000 votes for Buhari. “But today, we are inaugurating and commissioning 4,000 canvassers to garner at least 400,000 votes for President Buhari to continue another four more years”, the 2015 Delta APC governorship candidate, explained, while announcing Chief Ima Niboro as the Director General of Buhari Door-to-Door Campaign Programme in Delta state.
