Youngstars Development Initiative has said the postponement of February 16th presidential election all of a sudden, had exposed corps members, serving as ad-hoc staff to hardship, calling on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) to tackle unforeseen challenges. A statement issued by the initiative’s Media and Communication Officer, Evarista Daudu, called on the two bodies to immediately address the logistics provision for corps members, by drafting and sharing with the public, the Logistics Standards for the corps members during the rescheduled 23rd February and 9th March, 2019 general elections. The statement said both parties must promise to re-address and implement the stated welfare for corps members in the forthcoming elections in line with its budgetary provisions. It also said corps members should have direct formal communication by email, informing them of their welfare packages to avoid conflicting reports and malpractices and adequate security should be given to them. 2019 elections: Be unbiased — NYSC DG tells corps members 2019: Don’t soil our integrity, NYSC DG warns Corps Members in Abia NYSC members decry maltreatment by INEC officials
