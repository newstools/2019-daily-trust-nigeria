The Alliance for New Nigeria (ANN)’s Governorship candidate in Adamawa State, Abel Behora has denied alliance with other parties in the state ahead of the upcoming election. Abel, who said that there were rumors going on that he was having an alliance with oppositions, reiterated that it was an outright lie. The Chairman of ANN in the state, Ibrahim Bebetu lauded Behora’s participation in the governorship race, which he said was necessitated by the failure of past administrations to improve the lives of the people. Bebetu called on supporters to disregard the claim of alliance with oppositions and come out to vote for ANN in mass during the elections.
