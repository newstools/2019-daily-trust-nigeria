The Resident Electoral Commissioner for Niger State, Prof Sam Egwu, has debunked reports of missing ballot papers for Niger East and Niger North senatorial districts. Media reports quoted the REC as saying during an interactive session with newsmen that ballot papers for the areas could not be traced. According to the reports, the anomaly had already been communicated to INEC headquarters in Abuja for urgent attention. However, Prof Egwu told Daily Trust on telephone late yesterday that no ballots were missing as reported. “As we speak I’m taking delivery of the remaining sensitive materials at the Central Bank of Nigeria office in Minna. As I’m also speaking with you, vehicles for conveying the materials for their respective destinations are waiting to move tonight,” he said. Egwu also pointed out that all facilities for the conduct of free and fair elections in Niger State had been provided with the non-sensitive materials already moved to various destinations across the 25 LGAs of the State.
