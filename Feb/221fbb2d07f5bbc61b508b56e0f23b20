The All Progressives Congress (APC) director general of the presidential campaign for FCT, Alhaji Musa Yahaya Muhammad, has said that the postponement of last Saturday’s elections by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is uncalled for. Muhammad, who was addressing newsmen in Abuja, yesterday, while reacting to the postponement of the election, said it was unfortunate that the election was postponed few hours to the polls. He said all that was required by INEC to conduct hitch-free elections had been provided by Mr President, adding that it beat every one’s imagination that INEC went ahead and postponed the elections. He, however, said as a Muslim, he had no option than to see the postponement of the election as God’s design, adding that he prayed that the postponement would bring success for the APC. He berated the opposition for accusing the president of been behind the postponement of the election, saying “that is the double standard of the opposition. When it pleases them, they celebrate INEC and when it doesn’t, they give INEC names and try to align the iniquities of INEC to the ruling party.” The APC FCT campaign director general therefore urged all members and supporters of the APC in the FCT to be calm and remain law abiding, saying the APC would emerge victorious during the rescheduled election.
