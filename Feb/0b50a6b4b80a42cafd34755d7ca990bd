The presidential candidate of the Peoples Trust (PT), Mr. Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, has said about 70 per cent of Nigerians are yet to decide on who to vote as president. Mr. Olawepo-Hashim, however, said his party was willing to form a government of national unity and so his party should be voted into power. He said both the ruling APC the PDP had failed Nigerians, but that his government would create jobs for the teeming unemployed youths and ensure rapid economic development. In a statement yesterday, Olawepo-Hashim said he would not step down for any candidate of the two “big parties” and advised eligible voters to secure their future by voting wisely during the polls. “This is one of the reasons I said if elected we will form a government of national unity which will include the good people in the APC and the PDP,” he said. “Nigeria is a very interesting country, and I don’t know any country where other parties’ candidates are pressured to step down. I think it’s a coinage here, because in a multi-party democracies, nobody steps down; you win some seats, and based on this, you can form a coalition based on programme after the election,” he added. 2019: Gbenga Hashim and the Arewa challenge Ex-ADP presidential aspirant endorses Olawepo-Hashim I'll run all-inclusive gov’t to rescue Nigeria - PT presidential candidate
