A chieftain of the APC, Engr. Kailani Muhammad, has said PDP candidate Atiku Abubakar is desperate to be president of Nigeria. Addressing a press conference in Kaduna, yesterday, Muhammad alleged, “Most frightening and daunting of Atiku’s desperation to occupy the presidential villa is manifest in his bribe of Christian and Muslim clerics across Nigeria.” The APC chieftain also alleged that there was international and local gang-up against President Muhammadu Buhari which he said would fail because the masses of Nigeria are with the president. According to him, “Unlike former President Goodluck Jonathan who failed due to such international gang-up in 2015, President Buhari will come out stronger because he is incorruptible.” We’re not afraid of Saraki, others- APC chieftain Buhari remains S/West’s preferred leader – APC chieftain Atiku not a threat to Buhari – APC chieftain
