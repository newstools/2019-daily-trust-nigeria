The General Overseer of Evangelical Bible Outreach Ministries Int’l (EBOMI), Prophet Isa El-Buba, has predicted that President Muhammadu Buhari will lose Saturday’s presidential election, saying that all the evidence on ground favoured his prediction. Speaking at a press conference in Jos, Prophet El-Buba said the PDP candidate, Atiku Abubakar, would emerge winner because of his antecedents and achievements. He said there was no way the president could win adding that even with the rigging, it would still be difficult for the APC to win. “The Nigerian people will surely vote and protect their votes this Saturday. If President Buhari loses the election, he will have no option than to go to Daura. And if he presses on with what they have planned to make sure that they stay in power, the Nigerian people will do the needful and we all know the things that will be done to get the president to accept the result of the election,” he said.
