We will go back and analyse the issue to know the next line of action to take. “As you can see, the presiding officers complained of lack of use of card readers during the voting exercise of the presidential and national assembly elections in the state coupled with over-voting. So, we will look into all these and other circumstances, provisions of the law and see what the law says so as to pursue our rights.” Presidential Poll: Buhari clinches Nasarawa State #NigeriaDecides: Atiku defeats Buhari in Edo APC candidates ahead in Kano, Yobe LGs
