The PDP has sued INEC, the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) and the Minister for Interior, Lt-Gen Abdulrahman Bello Dambazau over alleged participation of Nigeriens in the campaign rally of the APC in Kano State. In an originating summons filed on its behalf by Barrister Kalu Agu, the PDP asked the Federal High Court in Abuja to declare that having regard to Section 12 of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended), foreigners and/or aliens cannot participate either directly or indirectly in Nigeria’s general elections. The court was also asked to declare that the participation of two Nigerien governors in the APC’s campaign rally was contrary to Nigerian law and public policy. In the affidavit supporting the summons, one Ademola Fanokun, who described himself as a legal officer for PDP, said the presence of Governors Issa Moussa and Zakiri Umar from Zinder and Maradi states of Niger Republic at APC’s rally in Kano on January 31 had “heightened fears among the opposition, including the plaintiff (PDP), that foreigners will take part in the election process in border states.” Page 18 PDP demands probe of thugs, Niger govs appearance at Buhari campaign rally Probe foreign presence at Buhari rally – PDP
