Simultaneous accreditation and voting has commenced in some parts of Abuja. At the ECOWAS Secretariat polling unit and primary schools in Asokoro, Abuja queues have been formed and accreditation and voting is ongoing. Our roving correspondent reports that accreditation and voting are ongoing in Jikwoyi, Karu and other suburbs of Abuja. However, there is no voting at the polling unit at the A.Y.A. (around former Total Filling Station) in Asokoro, Abuja as of the time of filing this report. No INEC or other ad-hoc staff of the commission were sighted. Voters complained that the late commencement may affect the voting and could disenfranchise many of the voters.
