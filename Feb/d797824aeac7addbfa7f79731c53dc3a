The PDP and APC in Sokoto State have disagreed over the recent utterances of Sen. Aliyu Wamakko who reprimanded traditional rulers against partisan politics. Sen. Wamakko had during a campaign rally in Tureta Local Government Area of the state, asked traditional rulers not to allow themselves to be dragged into politics. Wammako, a former governor, recalled all the good will extended to traditional rulers during his government but which never tried to involve them in active politics. He, therefore, appealed to them to maintain neutrality by resisting any attempt to be lure them into partisan politics. Wamakko quoted a Hausa proverb “Duk tsohon da bai ji kunyar hawan jaki ba, jaki bazai ji kunyar kayar da shi ba”, meaning, any elder who is not ashamed to mount a donkey, the donkey will not be ashamed of throwing him to the ground. Speaking to Daily Trust, the state spokesperson of the APC, Sambo Danchadi, said the Wammako was only cautioning the institution which was known neutrality. “So, we should not quote him out of context because he did not mention any name,” he said. However, the Publicity Secretary of the PDP in the state, Nura Hausawa, said there was never an attempt by the PDP government in the state to involve traditional rulers in politics. “The governor only visited them to seek their blessing and support to his government during his campaign in their domains as our tradition entails, but not to drag them into politics,” he said. “But we all know what transpired during his (Wamakko’s) time when traditional rulers were intimidated and removed for not supporting his party,” he alleged.
