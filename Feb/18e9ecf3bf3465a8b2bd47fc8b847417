Senator Barnabas Gemade, representing Benue Northeast District (Zone A) has called for the cancellation of the senatorial result from the area, alleging massive rigging. But his co-contestant, ex-Governor Gabriel Suswam, has advised him to accept defeat in good faith. Daily Trust reports that the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC has not yet declared the winner of the seat. Gemade, who is seeking a third term mandate on the platform of Social Democratic Party, SDP, told newsmen at the INEC headquarters in Makurdi on Monday morning that he was at the commission to report noticeable problems which characterised the elections in his area. “When electoral rules are not followed, you (I’m) asking for cancellation,” he said. He said the Suswam’s Peoples Democratic Party perpetuated electoral fraud in his area, using all manners of miscreants to thumbprint ballot papers in their party’s favour in five out of the seven local government areas which make up the district. He therefore, called on INEC not to declare whatever ‘fake’ result being brought to its office. Suswam, who stormed INEC headquarters few minutes after Gemade left, said he came to ensure that his victory at the polls was not upturned just as he denied any election malpractice in the district. “The honourable thing to do is to accept defeat. When he (Gemade) defeated me as a sitting governor in 2015, I accepted it in good faith. I didn’t even go to court. I expect that when the results are finally announced, he should congratulate the winner,” the former governor added.
