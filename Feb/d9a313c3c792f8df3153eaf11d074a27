The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has generated over N23billion in unpaid taxes from the recently suspended substitution exercise on corporate bank accounts. This was disclosed in Lagos yesterday at the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) Interactive Forum on Tax Matters by Mr. Babatunde Fowler, the FIRS Chairman. Fowler, who was guest speaker at the event, explained that the focus of exercise were 3,000 companies deducting Value Added Tax (VAT) and Withholding Tax (WHT) on behalf of the Federal Government without remitting such. The companies, he said, had no tax identification and therefore could not remit the deducted taxes to government, making them treat such deductions as part of their cash flow. Fowler stated that the suspension of the exercise for 30 days, announced last weekend, was occasioned by the deluge of corporate taxpayers visiting FIRS offices to regularize their tax affairs and make payments, a situation that stretched the Service administratively, as it could not lift the lien on their accounts as quickly as it wished.
