The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Friday demanded the immediate and unconditional release of its Kwara South Senatorial candidate, Sen. Rufai Ibrahim and other members of the party allegedly “framed-up, arrested and detained” by the Police in Kwara state. The party made the demand in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan in Abuja. Ologbondiyan said that the continued detention of Ibrahim on the eve of a crucial election, in which he is a lead contender, was provocative. He cautioned the police to stop harassing, arresting and detaining PDP members on “flimsy charges” that could directly pitch security agents against the people. Ologbondiyan said that the PDP members in Kwara or any other state, were law-abiding but would never allow themselves to be subjugated by anybody, particularly in this critical electoral process. He called PDP members to immediately activate their individual and collective defence mechanisms by using every legitimate means available, to resist and dismantle the All Progressives Congress (APC) rigging machinery. “We know that the plan of the APC is to stop our members from accessing their polling centres. “Our members should deploy all legitimate means, including lawful self-preservation strategies and tactical maneuvers to beat the aggression, arrive at their respective polling centers and exercise their voting rights accordingly. “The PDP, therefore, calls on the Inspector General of Police to immediately call the Kwara State Commissioner of Police, Kayode Egbetokun to order. “We also call on lovers of democracy all over the world to rise in condemnation of this wicked harassment and arrest of our members ahead of a crucial election.” (NAN) PDP threatens to pull out of presidential peace pact PDP agrees to change name, fulfils demand by R-APC PDP threatens to pull out of peace pact
