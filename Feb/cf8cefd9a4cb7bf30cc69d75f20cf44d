The Senator representing the FCT, Philip Aduda (PDP), has called on eligible voters to come out and  vote for all the candidates of the PDP right from the presidential down to the councillorship positions during the February 16, and  March 2, 2019 general elections. Sen. Aduda made the call while addressing PDP members and his supporters during his campaign tour to Nuku, Sabon Gari, Central and North East wards of  Abaji Area Council on Saturday. He said the PDP had performed creditably well under the past administration, hence, there was the need to vote for the party to bounce back and continue with the good work, adding that he would continue to provide good representation to the people of the FCT with viable infrastructure that would impact on their lives. “I want to assure my good people of entire Abaji Area Council that we will continue to do those good things we have been doing, especially infrastructure, youth and women empowerment, if given the mandate,” he said. Aduda further urged all PDP members to embark on house to house, ward to ward and polling unit to polling unit campaign, while urging residents of the council to continue to live in peace with one another. The PDP House of Representatives candidate for Abuja South, Alhaji Hassan Sokodabo, assured Aduda that he would mobilise all PDP members and supporters to ensure the party won during the elections. 2019: Aduda meets PDP stakeholders, calls for unity 2019: Aduda takes campaign to Utako market We know the formulae to unseat Aduda – Buhari campaign DG
