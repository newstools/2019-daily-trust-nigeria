Oil traded near a three-month high as OPEC’s output curbs tightened global supply while trade talks between the U.S. and China lifted financial markets. Futures rose as much as 1.3 percent to the highest since Nov. 20, after advancing 5.4 percent last week. International oil benchmark Brent was at $66.31 a barrel, up 6 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, after gaining 6.7 percent last week. President Donald Trump said talks with China were “very productive ” as his team returned from Beijing and readied for another round of discussions in Washington this week, raising hopes that a trade war between the world’s largest economies will ease. Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have made a strong start to their production cuts while Russia is accelerating its curbs, pushing crude 24 percent higher this year. Supply is also being threatened because of American sanctions against Venezuela and Iran. Reports that the U.S. and China had reached consensus in principle on the main topics in their trade negotiations helped boost investors’ risk appetite. “Saudi Arabia seems willing to do whatever is necessary to reach levels of $80 a barrel, and judging by the price reaction, they’re on track,” said Eugen Weinberg, head of commodities research at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. “Even rather bearish factors, like a stronger-than-expected rise in U.S. oil production does not seem to derail the price recovery.”  Oil on track for weekly gains on trade talk hopes, OPEC-led supply cuts Oil at $74 on report of U.S. inventory drop, Iran sanctions Oil prices fall on global growth concerns, U.S. supply glut
