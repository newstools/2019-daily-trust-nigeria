The Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, yesterday, disclosed that the Federal Government has approved the licenses of 108 firms to produce and distribute pre-paid meters nationwide. The approval is meant to complement the existing companies currently handling meter distribution on behalf of government. Speaking at the commissioning of a 33KV transmission sub-station at Ilashe Island in Oriade Local Government Development Area (LCDA) of Lagos State, Fashola, who was accompanied by the gubernatorial aspirant of the ruling APC, Mr. Babajide Sanwoolu, explained that by the time the firms commenced the distribution of meters, it would bring to an end estimated billing system currently being witnessed by most electricity consumers. On the commissioning of the N150m sub-station, the minister said the project which was part of the Federal Government’s rural electrification project, would cater for most communities in the riverine areas within Oriade. According to him, a 132/33KVA sub-station would not only serve Ilashe but would serve other riverine communities in the area. “Riverine communities in Lagos have not known the benefits of electrification. They have been neglected by successive governments. For the first time in their existence, the communities will now enjoy Federal Government’s electricity project. It will bring about employment as the sub-station will enhance power supply. Cottage businesses will begin to spring up,” he added.   108 firms to supply meters directly to homes, businesses Hope, anxiety as FG moves to deregulate electricity meter acquisition New power firms owe FG N10bn
