…says intervention saved 3000 jobs in Arik, Aero The Federal Government said yesterday it will pay the remaining 50 per cent of the severance package of the pensioners of the defunct Nigeria Airways. The Minister of State for Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, who disclosed this in a chat with newsmen, also expressed dismay that previous governments failed to pay the Ex-workers since 2003 when the airline was liquidated. Daily Trust reports that the Federal Government had late last year paid 50 per cent of the entitlements of about 6000 Nigeria Airways pensioners after over 14 years of agitation. In appreciation of the gesture, the ex-workers held a solidarity rally endorsing President Muhammadu Buhari for second term. According to the aviation Minister, the refusal not to pay the Ex-workers was not good for the system. “You don’t treat your citizens bad and expect the younger ones to put in their best into the system, but President Buhari ensured that they were paid part of their benefits. I can however assure you that the remaining balance would be paid as promised”, he said. The Minister said the aviation sector has recorded significant achievements in the present administration especially in the areas of safety, growing domestic operations, reintroduction of zero import duties on aircraft, engine and spare parts. He disclosed that the government’s intervention in Aero and Arik Air had saved huge jobs in the sector.
