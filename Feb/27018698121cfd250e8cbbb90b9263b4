The Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) has taken delivery of another consignment of critical spare parts required for the continuous service and operation of the Total Radar Coverage of Nigeria (TRACON). The consignment, which was cleared at the Apapa Port in Lagos from Thales Group, in France, included MES1 1400A power supply modules, control units and other critical units that would be used by NAMA engineers to effect repairs on any of the nine TRACON installations across the country. The TRACON project, which cost the Federal Government €66m, was installed in 2011 to deepen surveillance of the Nigerian airspace. There were reports in the past about how lack of spare parts had stalled proper functioning of the project. But NAMA had insisted it maintained a solid relationship with its partners, the Thales Group of France. The Managing Director of NAMA, Capt. Fola Akinkuotu, who was quoted in the weekly bulletin of the agency, said “the relationship between NAMA and the equipment manufacturer, Thales, has never been a frosty one as some media reports would have it. In fact it has been very cordial and we are poised to continue to keep it that way.’’ “You will recall that we cleared some consignments of spare parts for TRACON last year from the same Thales.” Total radar coverage project on course, says NAMA Aviation: 66m euro radar project stalls over parts scarcity Long awaited commissioning and uncompleted TRACON project raise dust
