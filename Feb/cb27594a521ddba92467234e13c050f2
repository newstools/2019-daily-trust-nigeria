A chieftain of the opposition PDP in the FCT, Mr. Tanko Kura, has said the party will not allow the ruling APC to take it unawares again during the March 2, 2019, area councils’ elections. Mr. Kura, who was the PDP chairmanship candidate for the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) in the 2016, said this during the party’s town hall meeting in Abuja on Wednesday, organized by the AMAC PDP chairmanship candidate, Mrs. Vivian Anazodo. He said the PDP learnt a lot of lessons during the 2016 area councils’ elections, alleging that the ruling APC used thugs to rig him out. “If you recollect, in 2016 I contested for the chairmanship of AMAC and was rigged out by APC. It was an unexpected thing that we never envisaged even though they were saying it openly which we never believed until when they did what they bragged about,” he alleged. He said it had become necessary for him to call on every PDP member and supporters to ensure they stood firm to protect their votes at the polling units. The PDP chieftain said it was disheartening to see that APC stalwarts were bragging that Buhari had already won the February 16, 2019, election despite the fact that the election was yet to be conducted. “So this time around, we will not sit down and be taken unawares; as we have to protect our votes because even the security; we can’t trust them with our votes,” he added. The PDP chairmanship candidate for AMAC, Mrs. Vivian Anazodo, said the town hall meeting provided PDP stalwarts and stakeholders avenue to come together and brainstorm on how to ensure the party’s victory during the February 16 presidential, National Assembly and March 2, 2019, chairmanship elections. Mrs. Anazodo called on party supporters and members who had not collected their PVCs to do so in order to ensure their lives changed.
