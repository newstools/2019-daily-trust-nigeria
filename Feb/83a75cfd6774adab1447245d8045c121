The lawmaker representing Kaduna Central Senatorial District, Senator Shehu Sani has called for the cancellation of National Assembly elections ‎in Kaduna State The Senator who made the call at a news briefing in Kaduna said Saturday’s election was fraudulent. He said the elections did not hold in most of the local government areas within his constituency which include Giwa, Birnin-Gwari and Igabi . ‎Shehu Sani called on Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC to cancel the election in the interest of justice. “We are concerned about what our party agents told us happened during the elections such as the failure of card readers, rigging and votes buying. There were also cases of higher voting because in some polling units the number of people that voted were more than the number of people accredited. ” This happened because there was no total scrutiny of voters. In Giwa LGA, the adhoc staff that conducted the election were not those trained by INEC. In Birnin Gwari, there were cases of rigging as well as harassment of voters,” he said. Shehu Sani also said that in Igabi local government, ballot papers were not available for people to vote on time. He said his party, the peoples Redemption Party, PRP, has forwarded a letter of protest to INEC seeking cancellation of all the elections, particularly Senate and House of Representatives elections.
