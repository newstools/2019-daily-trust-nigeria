The Publicity Secretary of the Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC), Barrister Yinka Oguntimehin, has asserted that the man a mob killed at Okota, Lagos, on Saturday during the election was not a member of the Aare Gani Adams-led OPC. Since the killing, residents of the Okota area have  been apprehensive about moving about due to anticipated reprisal attack from the OPC. But in a statement made available to journalists yesterday, Oguntimehin dismissed the report that a member of the OPC was lyched to death following an attempt by some hoodlums to truncate the election process in Okota. He said the report at his disposal indicated that it was a member of another group that the irate mob killed following an attempt by some thugs to disrupt the election process. He, however, reaffirmed the commitment of the group to peaceful, free, fair and credible elections, saying the OPC of today was totally different from that of the past. “I need to say it clearly that Ademola was not a member of our group. Ours is a group of professionals and well-educated members. We have our structures across the country, and everybody can attest to the fact that the Aare Gani Adams- led members of the OPC are not vagabonds or thugs. “For a very long time, we have transited into a brand new OPC, with a clear-cut ideology. And part of our ideology is to ensure peace across the country, especially in the south-west,” he said. Oguntimehin urged Nigerians to remain peaceful till the end of the election process. “From the turnout of people across the country, I think Nigerians are committed to this democracy. We have started well and I will urge the electorate to remain peaceful by cooperating with the police to ensure free, fair and credible elections,” he added.
