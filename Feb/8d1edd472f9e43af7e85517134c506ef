Eskimi DSP, a Lithuania-based firm and the largest programmatic network in Africa, has partnered with Vconnect, a Nigeria, Lagos-based homegrown online service marketplace, to introduce a new digital product in Nigeria with the ability to target small and medium businesses. A release from Eskimi explained that the partnership was launched based on the Eskimi Audience and Inventory Extension solution which enables publishers to enter the data market and open new data revenue streams. Publishers who have valuable and niche audiences, the document stated, can use the Eskimi Audience and Inventory Extension functionality to re-target their audience outside their site. Eskimi Chief Executive Officer Vytas Paukstys stated, “We were always getting requests from banks and financial clients to be able to reach the small and medium enterprise segment. It is very hard to separate and target this segment online. “Our partnership with Vconnect introduces a new product in the market and we already are able to reach 50,000 small and medium business owners and two million young professionals with intent to buy products and services.” The release explained that targeting small and medium enterprise segment helps to reach right users at the right time. “Narrowing down the segment for small and medium enterprise helps to save budget, and allows communication with the right consumers and reach marketing goals,” the company said.
