Analysts at Afrinvest said: “We anticipate the bearish run to be sustained this week due to pre-election jitters caused by the uncertainties surrounding the elections.” The Managing Director of Cowry Asset Management, Johnson Chukwu, said the events of the last 72 hours would have elevated the risk rating on Nigeria and would have cast aspersion on the ability of the electoral body to conduct a credible poll. He said: “Going by these events, if we were to borrow funds internationally, we would have to pay a high interest rate so it is expected that the market reacted the way it did. “We would have the opportunity to reverse these trends if the elections go very well and the actors in the elections behave responsibly post elections.” Investors lose N167bn as bearish performance persists on NSE Equities market loses N111bn Stock market  records N254bn gain
