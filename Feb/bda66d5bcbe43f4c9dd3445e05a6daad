The leadership of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa, on Monday, protested the killing of its members during campaign rally in Tungbaburi community of Sagbama Local government area of the state last Saturday. The leader of the party in the state, Chief Timipre Sylva and Minister of State for Agriculture, Senator Heineken Lokpobiri led the protest to the Police Headquarters in Yenagoa. Speaking during the protest march to the police headquarters, Chief Timipre Sylva, a former governor of the state, said that the killing of an APC member at a rally in Sagbama was one two many. He recalled that the party campaigns had been riddled with several attacks by members of rival political party while their perpetrators have not been brought to book. He said: “We have been watching the scenario where members of our party are being attacked while we are canvassing for votes, two of them were killed recently in Nembe and we reported the incidents but the Police is not doing enough. “We are here to send a strong message to the Police high Command and Inspector-General of Police that the persecution and killing of our members in Bayelsa is not acceptable. “The state Police Commissioner, Mr Aminu Saleh, in his response, dismissed the allegations that the Police in the State was biased. He said: “The Nigerian Police is a Federal Institution and the Command under my watch in Bayelsa is poised to be fair to all in the discharge of our duty, I am aware of the allegations and counter allegations even before my deployment. “We shall look into the cases even the ones reported before my arrival, the problem we have is that while a case is being investigated, it is not strategic to keep in public domain, but it does not mean that we are not working,” he said.
