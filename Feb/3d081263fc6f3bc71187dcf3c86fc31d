The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has accused the Presidency of releasing over N6 billion “looted from federal funds” to the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Assembly candidates to execute the party’s “rigging plans” in the rescheduled February 23 Presidential and National Assembly elections. The Director, Media and Publicity of the PDP Presidential Campaign Organisation, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan said in a statement on Tuesday that “each of the 109 APC senatorial candidates received N20 million, the 360 APC House of Representatives candidates are being given N10 million each, while various amounts are being disbursed by the Buhari Presidency to some other APC leaders for the rigging plot.” The PDP said the “looted funds” are to be used by the APC to dress fake security agents, arm thugs and bribe compromised INEC officials in order to manipulate the elections in the various Senatorial and Federal constituencies across the country. The party added that part of the money was sourced from the alleged diversion of funds meant for the rehabilitation of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in various states of the federation. The party added that other sources of funding included monies allegedly siphoned from some income generating agencies, like the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) and the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). “At a time well-meaning leaders all over the world are exerting themselves in creating wealth for their people and developing their nations, the Buhari Presidency, which plunged the nation into a bitter economic recession, is still busy frittering our national resources to finance its vicious plots against the already impoverished citizens,” the PDP said. 2019: How political parties are raking in billions 2015: Buhari’s camp insists on automatic Presidential ticket Crowd at APC rally in Kaduna
