The acting Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, has assured Nigerians that adequate security measures have been put in place to ensure a safe, secure and conducive environment towards a peaceful and credible election. A statement on Thursday from Police spokesman, Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Frank Mba, said the IGP called on the citizens to come out en-masse on the day of the election to cast their votes without any fear or apprehension. He said the IG assures that security operatives deployed for the general election will be professional, neutral, firm and fair, whilst warning would-be perpetrators of violence to steer-clear. Mba said security personnel deployed for the elections have been adequately trained and are under strict instruction to abide by the Standard Operational Procedures of the Force and international best practices. He said they will remain patriotic, steadfast, professional, neutral and civil, but firm, in their conducts and actions throughout the period and beyond. He said, “The general public are therefore implored not to feel intimidated, but rather should be emboldened, by the presence of security personnel deployed to their areas, to go out and exercise their franchise.” “The IGP however warns those who may want to undermine the electoral process by engaging in snatching of ballot boxes, hate speeches and vote trading to desist from such acts or face the full consequences of the law,” the Police stated.
