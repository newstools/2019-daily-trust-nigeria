Some clerics across major faiths in Nigeria on Thursday stormed Abuja at a grand finale of a rally to endorse President Buhari. The event was held at the Unity Fountain, Abuja. The National Inter-Faith and Religious Organizations for Peace (NIFROP)  said that President Muhammadu Buhari was anointed to lead the country for eight years, and as such, should be given the necessary support for him to fulfil the prophecy.  The group called on Nigerians not to disrupt the flow of God’s blessing to the land, rather support the re-election bid of President Buhari, so he could continue running the errand God has sent him. The National President of NIFROP, Bishop Sundy Garuba, said the Buhari-led government has been winning the war against insurgency and should be allowed to continue the task for another four years. “Before the National Inter-Faith and Religious Organizations for Peace [NIFROP] announced today’s rally sometimes last week, we had been led by the spirit to hold forty days of fasting and prayer.  In the course of this exercise, undertaken on behalf of the nation, it was revealed to us that President Buhari is God’s anointed to lead Nigeria to greater heights,” he said Religious bodies on solidarity rally to Aso Villa …Ndigbo group plans mega rally for Buhari Buhari: Building religious harmony
