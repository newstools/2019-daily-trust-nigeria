The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission yesterday in Lagos secured a court order for the arrest of a former Director General of the National Intelligence Agency, Ambassador Ayodele Oke and his wife, Folasade. Justice Chukwujeku Aneke issued the order consequent upon an oral application by the EFCC counsel, Rotimi Oyedepo. Aneke held that: “I have carefully considered the oral application for the arrest of the person mentioned herein, and I am convinced beyond reasonable doubt that the said application is meritorious. “Accordingly the application is hereby granted as prayed. “It is hereby ordered that Ambassador Ayedele Oke and wife, Folasade Oke, should be arrested anywhere they are been sighted in the world.” Oke and his wife are wanted in connection with the $43,449,947, £27,800 and N23,218,000 cash recovered by the EFCC from an apartment at Osborne Road, Ikoyi, Lagos, in April 2017. They are facing a four-count charge bordering on money laundering offence to the tune of N13 billion.
