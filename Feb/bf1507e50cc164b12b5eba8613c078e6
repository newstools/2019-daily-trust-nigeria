A former president of the Nigerian Bar Association, Olisa Agbakoba, has advised the PDP’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, not to approach the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal. Agbakoba, in a statement yesterday, said while the winner of the Saturday’s presidential poll,  President Muhammadu Buhari, kept his base in the north, Atiku largely held his in the south. According to him, the voting pattern for the 2019 presidential election shows ethnicity played a significant role in the poll. “I understand the PDP is aggrieved about the outcome of the election and alleged massive irregularities. But I urge former Vice President Atiku Abubakar not to approach the Election Petition Tribunal.  He might have moved backwards by his loss, but he should not lose sight of the legacy and greatness that lies in front of him”, Agbakoba said. He said Atiku “is in a strong position to take up the mantle of a statesman. He can build a new Nigeria movement from the motley of small parties, third force actors, change actors and millions who are desperate for a strong, united Nigeria. There is also a lot of work to be done in both political and electoral reforms. I request former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar to step into the shoes. “This is not to say I do not recognize the massive irregularities in the 2019 Presidential Election. I can see how tempting it is to take the option of the Election Petition Tribunal but that in my view is not the right decision. We look forward to a new Nigeria, strong and united; a new Nigeria that will not vote on the basis of ethnic and primordial sentiments.” Presidential poll: Agbakoba urges Atiku to shun tribunal Fresh gamble for 2011 presidency In Ogun, no easy ride for Buhari, Atiku
