The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has promised to take punitive measures against sponsors of Ogun presidential rally violence after the elections. The APC National Publicity Secretary, Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu said, in a statement today, that the party regretted Monday’s alleged premeditated attacks purportedly sponsored by Governor Ibikunle Amosun on President Muhammadu Buhari and other senior party leaders at the venue of the presidential campaign rally in Ogun State. Issa-Onilu, who said the party would review what he called ‘gross misconduct’, added that party supremacy and discipline were not matters of choice but binding principles which must be adhered to by all party members. The APC spokesman, who urged party supporters and members not to be disturbed by Monday’s condemnable incident, implored all to continue trooping out enmasse for the remaining campaigns and vote massively for only APC candidates in the forthcoming general elections. “This is one act of indiscipline too many. The APC will not condone acts of indiscipline, indiscretion and anti-party activities from any party member no matter how highly placed. “The party will review this gross misconduct of deliberately positioning thugs to attack and embarrass the President and the party’s leadership. The party will take a decision on this matter immediately after the elections,” the statement read in part.
