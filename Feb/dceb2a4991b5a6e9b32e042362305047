Algeria’s 81-year-old President Abdelaziz Bouteflika will seek a fifth term in April’s elections, the state news agency APS announced on Sunday. A message to the nation would be release later on Sunday, APS said. Mr Bouteflika has been in office for 20 years but has rarely been seen in public since he had a stroke in 2013. He is confined to a wheelchair and has cancelled recent official meetings. Critics say this makes it difficult for him to carry out his duties. Mr Bouteflika’s last meeting with a senior foreign official was during a visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel in September. An earlier meeting with with her had been cancelled.
