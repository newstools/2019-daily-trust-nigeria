Turkey has called on China to close its detention camps following the reported death of a renowned musician from the ethnic Uighur minority. Abdurehim Heyit is thought to have been serving an eight-year sentence in the Xinjiang region, where up to a million Uighurs are reportedly being detained. A statement from Turkey’s foreign ministry said they were being subjected to “torture” in “concentration camps”. China described the comments as “completely unacceptable”. The Uighurs are a Muslim Turkic-speaking minority based in the north-west Xinjiang region of China, which has come under intense surveillance by Chinese authorities.
