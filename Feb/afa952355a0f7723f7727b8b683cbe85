A Non-Governmental Organisation, One Project Africa Reachout Foundation, has urged Nigerians to shun violence and avoid vote selling or buying . The Executive Director of the group, Zigwai Ayuba, who led foundation officials on a visit to Kaduna  State Police Command Headquarters, also ‎urged the police to arrest those found spreading hate speech before and during the elections. She said the aim of the peace walk and visit to the command was to enlighten the public on the need to vote not to fight and that election was not war. The team leader expressed optimism that police will do the needful in ensuring law and order during the election. ‎Responding the Commissioner of Police, Ahmad Abdul-Rahaman, commended the group for their commitment toward passing the message of peace to Kaduna citizens. He said the police would continue to partner with the NGO to ensure peaceful conduct of the 2019 general election. “The problems with us in Nigeria is not the citizen, it is the leadership, once the leadership decides to do the right thing for better Nigeria, then we are all going to get it right. “People who want to take the mantle of leadership of the country are still behaving as if they are still in the process of learning. How could a politician be so naive sending young children to destroy common posters of opponent and bill boards,” he said. The police boss called on politicians to focus on issue-based campaign devoid of hate speech. ‎ 2019: Police tasked on prompt response to distress calls Groups urge women to shun violence during election Group sensitises electorate on election
