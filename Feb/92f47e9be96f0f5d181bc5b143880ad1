The UK, France, Germany, Spain and other European countries have officially recognised opposition leader Juan Guaidó as interim president of Venezuela. It comes after President Nicolás Maduro defiantly rejected a deadline they set for Sunday to call fresh elections. Mr Guaidó declared himself interim leader last month and won US backing. Russia – a backer of Mr Maduro – accused EU countries of meddling in Venezuela’s affairs. On Sunday Mr Maduro dismissed calls for a new presidential vote, saying he would not accept “ultimatums”. He has denounced Mr Guaidó’s move as a coup. As head of Venezuela’s National Assembly, Mr Guaidó says the constitution allows him to assume power temporarily when the president is deemed illegitimate. After Sunday’s deadline passed, a flurry of statements was issued by France, the UK, Germany and Spain and the other countries that now recognise Mr Guaidó as interim president. Many of them pressed Mr Maduro to call new elections.
