Nigerian Army officer, Major Ajibade Atobatele, of the Directorate of Army Legal Services, studying in the United Kingdom, has finished with a distinction in International Human Rights and Terrorism Law, coming top in his class. The officer also bagged the Best Dissertation Award of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, University of Lancaster. He was recently honoured at the convocation ceremony of the University, which was held in the UK. Daily Trust gathered, on Monday, that the Director of Postgraduate Programmes in the Lancaster University Law School, Prof. Sigrun Skogly, confirmed, in a correspondence to the Nigerian Embassy in London, that the Army officer performed exceptionally well and achieved the highest mark, Â a mark she described as rarely awarded by the university. She said the Law School further confirmed that Major Atobatele has been offered a doctoral degree admission in order to further his research on legal issues surrounding the war against insurgency in Nigeria and he is expected to return to the Law school in early 2019. This feat by the Nigerian Army officer is coming on the heels of criticisms over its alleged poor human rights records especially, in regard to the fight against the Boko Haram insurgents in the North Eastern part of the country.
