A Maiduguri-based ICT firm, Digimatics, has developed an educational web browser called Opingo to turn students’ and youths’ interest from obscene and other immoral sites in the social media. “It has been designed with students in mind,” the Chief Executive Officer of the ICT firm, Abdullahi Abdulkarim Galtimari, told Kanem Trust in Maiduguri. “The Opingo web browser does not have an address bar; but it targets educational resource materials at the back end,” he said. “So it directly accesses open academy; open academy is a website that rolls out educational resource materials for students; as soon as the student clicks to Opingo it automatically takes him to nowhere else but Open academy,” Abdullahi Galtimari explained. “The Opingo concept is intended to protect the character of the students from all character-contaminating sites in the Facebook and social media, and boost the required moral upbringing in them according to ideal educational requirement of our society,” he explained further. “The development of Opingo was motivated by our desire to explore disadvantages of ICT, and then provide solutions. “Such social media disadvantages include the activities of internet predators and cyber bullying which bullies browsers into succumbing to whatever they feed them through the Internet,” the ICT CEO explained. He said Digimatics services included digital literacy, software development, database design and administration as well as web development.
