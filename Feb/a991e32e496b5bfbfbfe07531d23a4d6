Three separate applications brought before the Supreme Court have stalled hearing in the suit challenging the reinstating Al-Mustapha Jokolo as emir of Gwandu. Counsel to the incumbent Emir of Gwandu, Alhaji Muhammadu Iliyasu Bashar, Yunus Ustaz Usman (SAN) on Tuesday pleaded with the apex court to allow him to move the motion for injunction challenging the enforcement of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Sokoto dated May 3, 2016, and another application to consolidate all the motions dated December 13, 2016. Also, counsel to the Kebbi State Government, Salisu Maikyau (SAN) informed the court that his application seeking leave to cross-appeal was filed as SC/266/2017, which was permitted for hearing at the last adjourned date on May 28, 2018, was not listed for the day. Counsel to Jokolo, Samson Audu also reminded the apex court that his application for accelerated hearing and to amend his processes have not been taken. A five-member panel of justices presided by Justice Bode Rhodes-Vivour however adjourned to hear all the applications and that for consolidation. In earlier judgments of the High Court in 2005 and the Court of Appeal in Sokoto on April 14, 2016, the courts ordered that Jokolo’s salaries and entitlements for the 10 years he was out of office be paid to him as ordered by the high court. But the present Emir of Gwandu, Iliyasu Bashar, a cousin of Jokolo, however, approached the Supreme Court challenging the judgment of both courts.
