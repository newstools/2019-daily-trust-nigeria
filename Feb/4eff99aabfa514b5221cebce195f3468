The Federal Government has created a price checker platform to ensure uniformity in procurement across all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). Price Checker is a web-based platform for vendors of non-customised goods to upload the prices of their goods for use by all MDAs and governments in their public procurement process, the Efficiency Unit of the Ministry of Finance and the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP) who jointly created the checker said yesterday. In his remarks at the sensitisation programme on Price Checker and e-Procurement jointly organised by the ministry and BPP, the Head of Efficiency Unit of the ministry, Mr. Ojonimi Imaji, noted that government at all levels was facing paucity of funds in the discharge of its constitutional responsibilities as it is webbed by heavy financial burden. “This has made government to become inquisitive to explore and use all relevant avenues that will allow for transparency in its transactions and to have an improved revenue generation to be able to fund critical projects and programmes that will be beneficial to citizens,” he noted. The Head, Regulation and Database Department of the BPP, Mr. Aliyu Aliyu, said, “Price Checker is a platform that will allow product vendors to upload their prices so that our procurement will be more transparent such that government should not spend money on expensive items.’’ KOGI: FG to introduce price-checks in procurement process Finance ministry, BPP‎ move to strengthen procurement process in MDAs Leakage blockage: FG introduces e-procurement
