As Nigerians go to cast their votes tomorrow, the International Press Centre (IPC) in Lagos has tasked journalists and other relevant stakeholders on safety consciousness in the performance of key institutional roles. The Director of the Centre, Lanre Arogundade, in a statement gave the charge in the light of the emerging accusations and counter accusations by political actors and other players in the electoral process. He appealed to journalists covering the general elections to be safety conscious in the discharge of their duties and also to avoid situations that will put them in harms’ way. “Journalists are expected to be non-partisan. Being partisan is not only about being a member of a political party, but also includes the use of expressions or impressions with statements, tags, symbols and colours that portray or identify with a particular political party or personality,” he said. Arogundade also admonished stakeholders, especially the security agencies to undertake their tasks in a very professional manner. “The security agencies in recent times are the perpetrators of violence against journalists. Recent incidents as witnessed in the Osun re-run elections had shown vagrant abuse and violations of the rights of journalists. “The security forces should note that the media is a critical part of the electoral process and so the media should be accorded due rights and privileges to enable them carry out their social obligations as partners in enshrining the credibility of the electoral process. “Other stakeholders, including the elections observers should also proactively provide journalists covering the elections with information to ensure that they all work together for the credibility of the electoral process,” he added. 2019: Media on the spotlight for professionalism, credible polls 72% of attacks on journalists come from state security-IPC Journalist safety comes under spotlight
