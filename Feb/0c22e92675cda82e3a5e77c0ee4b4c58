Tanzania’s government is trying to find buyers for the hoard of cashew nuts it bought from farmers in November. Last year farmers complained that buyers’ offers for their crops were too low and refused to sell. The government then brought in an official price but the buyers refused to purchase the nuts at that price. So the government bought the crops and sent military trucks to pick them up. The government has realised that it doesn’t have the capacity to process all the nuts. ‘Cashew farmers lose billions of naira in Kogi’ Cashew farmers face daunting challenges in Kwara ‘Farmers, processors can make more money in cashew value chain’
