* Allegations wicked, deceptive, ungodly President Muhammadu Buhari has denied report that he has an agenda to Islamise the country. Buhari, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, described the allegations as wicked, deceptive and ungodly. “It has come to the notice of President Muhammadu Buhari, ahead of the forthcoming elections, that some unscrupulous Nigerians are again falsely and wickedly claiming that the administration has an agenda to impose Islam on Nigeria. “The objective is clearly to stoke up religious division for political gains. Some of these same persons made these devious and fabricated claims ahead of the 2015 election. They failed woefully,” he said. Buhari strongly affirmed the oath he took before the Nigerian people to faithfully defend the Constitution of Nigeria. “That Constitution guarantees freedom of worship for every Nigerian. It is this guarantee that enables all Nigerians to practise their faiths or religion without hindrance. Buhari further affirmed his commitment to freedom of religion and worship for all Nigerians, and that under no circumstance will any religion or faith be imposed on any Nigerian. “It is dangerous, deceptive and ungodly to play politics with religion,” he said.
