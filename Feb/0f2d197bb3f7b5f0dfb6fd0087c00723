The Managing Director of Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Hadiza Bala Usman, has said that only infrastructural development would expand the maritime sector. The MD disclosed that the key to attaining that is for stakeholders to recognize old patronage, stressing that doing so would enable participants in the sector to retain and gain more trust of other players. Usman, who was guest speaker at the public presentation of a book, ‘Footprints of President Muhammadu Buhari in the Maritime Sector’ in Lagos over the weekend, said that was imperative as “stakeholders have the liberty of choice and the discretion to review them as often as they will.” The book was written by members of the Shipping Correspondents of Nigeria  (SCAN) led by the board of trustee chairman, Bolaju Akinola. Ms Usman was represented by the Executive Director, Marine and Operations, Dr. Sokonte Davies. She noted that for most countries, “incomes from maritime operations represent an enormous revenue line that funds significant capital projects and social security systems,” thereby making integrity and transparency in the operations imperative. For Nigeria, the ports are a major gateway to the over 85 per cent of all goods and services into the country, which exploit facilities at the seaports with aggregate annual value exceeding the $15 billion mark, she said. According to her, it is against this background that the NPA opened its budget to the public by entering an agreement with BudgIT Open Budget System Platform, in line with the goals of the Buhari-led administration.
