Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said President Muhammadu Buhari will provide quality jobs for youths if re-elected. Osinbajo said this in Nsit Atai Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State during a special campaign rally of the APC. He added that to ensure creation of jobs, the Federal Government would soon launch an entrepreneurs’ bank that would give loans to young men and women and that the bank would operate through the N-Power, where loans with little interest rate would be given to youths to begin small scale businesses. He further said the government had so far fulfilled its promises to the people and provided jobs for 500,000 youths through N-Power. He urged the people to vote APC and President Buhari, noting that the people of the state should not be in the opposition as APC was taking the country to the next level. “President Buhari is determined to make sure that not only do you have jobs, but you have quality jobs,” he said.
