The Association of Nigerian Scholars in the Diaspora (ANSD) has expressed disappointment at the postponement of the presidential and national assembly elections. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), had last week shifted the polls, hinging its reason on logistics. The scholars said the postponement had caused severe hardships to many Nigerian voters and candidates, especially those who travelled to their polling units to exercise their franchise. A statement jointly signed by Bitru Gwamna, the president and Pita Agbese, secretary-general, called on Nigerians to support President Muhammadu Buhari, whom it claimed as laid a better foundation for a next level. “While we may wish to believe that INEC acted in the best interests of nation, the manner in which the postponement was done was inescapably untidy. After assuring the nation that it was ready to conduct the elections, INEC’s last minute decision to abort the process on February 16th left much to be desired,” the statement reads.
