A Karmo Grade 1 Area Court in Abuja has sentenced a security guard, Torres Audu, to three months imprisonment for stealing iron rods. Audu who resides at Jabi, was convicted on a two-count charge bordering on joint act and theft. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the matter was first mentioned on January 22, 2019, and the judge adjourned the case to enable the police conduct investigation. The Judge, Mr. Inuwa Maiwada, however, gave the convict an option of N3,000 fine and warned him to be of good behaviour. Maiwada also discharged one Mohammed Sa’adu who was arraigned with the convict. The Prosecutor, Mrs. Ijeoma Ukagha, had told the court that the matter was reported by one Alloy Okoye of Jabi, at the Utako Police Station, Abuja, on January 17, 2019. Ukagha said the convict and Sa’adu  worked as security guards at the complainant’s construction site. She explained that the complainant went to the site on that same date and discovered that 150 pieces of iron rod valued at N375,000 were missing. The prosecutor added that Audu pleaded guilty to the offence during police investigation, saying he sold the rods to one Jamilu Hassan, while Sa’adu denied committing the offence. Ukagha said the offences contravened Sections 79 and 288 of the Penal Code.
