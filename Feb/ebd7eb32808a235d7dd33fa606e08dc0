A Federal High Court sitting in Kano has fixed February 12 for the continuation of a suit challenging the eligibility of a former aide to President Muhammadu Buhari to contest for Sumaila/Takai Federal Constituency on APC platform. Abdulrahman Kawu Sumaila, who contested for the Kano South senatorial seat, is now being challenged by Muhammed Shamsuddeen Bello who contested for the House of Reps ticket for the constituency under APC. Bello joined INEC and APC as respondents in the case. Bello is in court challenging INEC, APC and Sumaila for substituting his name with Sumaila as APC’s candidate for the federal constituency, arguing that Kawu did not contested for the position in the last APC’s primary election conducted in Kano. He told the court that Kawu contested for the Kano South senatorial ticket but lost to Senator Kabiru Ibrahim Gaya. He told the court that Kawu’s name was strangely published as candidate for Takai/Sumaila Federal Constituency on the last day for publication of particulars of candidates. But counsel to APC and Kawu, Mr Okechukwu Edeze objected a move by the plaintiff’s lawyer, Mr. Nuraini Jimoh to present the prosecution witness, Alhaji Muhammed Shamsuddeen Bello for his testimony. Mr Edeze appealed to the court to give him time to study a reply on the point of law by counsel to the plaintiff which he was served with on Wednesday. In his ruling, the presiding judge, Justice Lewis Allagoa adjourned the case to February 12, for continuation.
