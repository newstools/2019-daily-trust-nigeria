Three people have been shot dead and five others critically injured in a shooting in Durban, the Police said on Monday. They said that two men and one woman were the dead victims of the shooting. Kwazulu-Natal police spokesperson, Col. Thembeka Mbhele, told Xinhua that the person behind the shooting also died. “We are at the scene collecting information and the place is cordoned off. The shooter is dead,’’ Mbhele said. The shooting occurred in a block of apartments in Victoria Embarkment. The cause of the shooting is yet to be determined. Durban Metro police, Parboo Sewpersad, told Xinhua that an off-duty Metro constable was among the killed during the shooting.
