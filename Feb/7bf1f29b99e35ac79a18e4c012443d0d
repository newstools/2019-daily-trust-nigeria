Buhari, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) added that if returned as president, his administration would ensure that there are no wastages. He told a crowd at the Pantami Township Stadium, Gombe, that he was thankful to Allah who has enabled him to contribute to the peace being enjoyed in the North-east now. Earlier, during a courtesy call on the Emir of Gombe, Alhaji Abubakar Shehu Abubakar III, Buhari promised to continue to improve on the agriculture sector for socio-economic development of the country.
