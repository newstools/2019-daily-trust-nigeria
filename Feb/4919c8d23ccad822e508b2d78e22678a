The Chairman of Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), Abdullahi Adamu Candido, has urged residents to be peaceful and calm as they await the new date of the Presidential and National Assembly elections in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Candido while addressing journalists, yesterday, urged residents to ensure that they vote on the new dates of the election. “Residents must never be allowed to be used against the system,” he said, adding that the council would continue to sensitise the traditional institutions and other stakeholders on the need to vote in a peaceful atmosphere. He said the postponement would by no means affect the decision of the electorate as they must have made up their mind on the candidates they desire to vote for, adding that there is no politician in Nigeria’s history that has done what President Muhammadu Buhari has done as a democrat. “I appeal to INEC to ensure that the postponement of the election does not become a culture in our electoral process; everything must be done to ensure adequate preparation as it will be in the interest of our continued effort at stabilising our democratic experience,” he said. He expressed hope that the campaign for the area council election now rescheduled for March 9 would not be affected by the ban on campaign activities by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
