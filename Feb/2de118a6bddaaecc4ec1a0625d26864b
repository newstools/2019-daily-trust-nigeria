Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Tuesday urged electorate in Ogun state to vote for only All Progressives Congress (APC) candidates for elective positions in February 16 and March 2 general elections. He described as “bad cutlasses” those promoting other parties’ agenda while still maintain membership of the APC. Osinbajo spoke in Yoruba language during a town hall meeting held at the palace of the Ebunmawe of Ago Iwoye, Oba Abdulrazak Adenugba, in Ijebu North local government area of Ogun state. His comments come exactly 24 hours after the party’s presidential rally in Abeokuta was marred by violence and booing. Osinbajo also reiterated this while speaking with some market traders in Olabisi Onabanjo market, Ota Osun in Ijebu Ode. He said “Vote for only APC for all the elective offices because, we don’t know those who are meddling or promoting another party. Anyone caught in such act can be described as bad cutlasses. “You need to vote for APC because even the most hardened enemy of President Muhammadu Buhari knows that he is neither a thief nor corrupt. “And secondly, you have to  vote for us because of many things that we have in stock for you.” 2019: Okorocha's son-in-law will have only one vote in Imo - Oshiomhole APC’ll defeat Amosun, Okorocha – Oshiomhole Booing mars APC presidential rally in Ogun
