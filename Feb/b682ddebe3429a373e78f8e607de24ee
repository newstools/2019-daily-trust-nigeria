The PDP in Sokoto State, yesterday, said it noted with dismay the purported claim by Sen. Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko that they are trying to rig elections in the state. “Our party views this latest spurious allegation as unfortunate and an insult on the good people of our dear state who are not unaware of the dirty politics being promoted and sanctioned by the senator,” contained in a statement signed by the Publicity Secretary of PDP, Abdullahi Hausawa. In the statement, PDP described the claim as sad and unbecoming of a former governor of the state. The party said it was confident of emerging victorious in free and fair polls. It, however, cautioned the senator to desist from making unsubstantiated allegations and focus on cleaning their act to uphold politics of maturity and honour. There were rumours that Wamakko had cautioned traditional rulers in the state against taking side with the PDP, saying anyone found wanting would not find it easy.
