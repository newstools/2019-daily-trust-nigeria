The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, has said he was moved to tears over his endorsement by Northern and Southern elders in the country as their candidate for the February 16 polls. Atiku, in a statement on Sunday by his media office, said the endorsement has further given him more courage to work hard, win the election and return Nigeria to its lost glory. Afenifere, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum, Pan-Niger Delta Forum and Middle Belt Forum on Sunday unanimously endorsed Atiku’s candidature in Abuja, less than two weeks to the polls. Atiku said he would run a properly federated Nigeria through constitutional reforms to bring out the best from all sections of the country to make Nigeria work if given the mandate. “I am moved to tears that in the midst of deep divisions and deliberate use of instrumentalities of state to set our people against themselves in the last three and a half years, responsible and respected leaders across Nigeria have agreed to come together for the purpose of endorsing my candidature for the February 16, 2019 presidential election. “I profusely thank our leaders across the country who have created this wonderful moment for us to come to the table of brotherhood. Once again, and in the words of our old National Anthem, we can proudly sing: ‘Though tribes and tongues may differ, in brotherhood we stand.’ “This has buoyed me to lead a Pan-Nigerian team that will give practical interpretation to what has been done by the time I take leadership of our country, by the grace of Allah, on May 29, 2019,” Atiku said.
