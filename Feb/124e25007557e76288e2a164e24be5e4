An Abuja-based NGO, Widows and Orphans Empowerment Organisation (WEWE), has partnered Deloitte on fraud prevention as part of effort to key into the Federal Government’s whistle blowing policy. In a statement made available to City News, Deloitte, an international auditing firm, has been engaged to provide whistle blowing and tip-off services for WEWE. Deloitte will also audit WEWE’s accounts as part of effort to be financially complaint in accordance with international best practices, a statement signed by Sylvia Agamah-Ochidi, Communications Officer of WEWE, indicated. WEWE said the whistle blowing policy would strengthen its fraud prevention system, helping it to retain its position as the “most financially compliant local NGO in Nigeria. “Not all local NGOs are fantastically corrupt, even though we are a local NGO, we are aiming to be more financially compliant than international NGOs,” Dr. Josephine Ogazi, Executive Director of  WEWE, was quoted in the statement. WEWE assured stakeholders to feel free to report fraudulent practices to them as all reported cases would be thoroughly investigated and that their identities would be kept secret. “Deloitte is one of the top four certified auditing firms in Nigeria. By reporting any case of fraud or misappropriation, WEWE recognises that whistle blowers help root out waste, fraud, abuse and protect public health and safety,” she added.
