The Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria (APCON) has reacted to an allegation that its clamp-down on some campaign billboards and posters of some political parties was targeted at opposition parties to favour the ruling party. Reacting in a statement to a recent report aired on the African Independent Television (AIT) network, the acting registrar of the council, Mrs Ijedi Iyoha, denied the insinuation of partisanship in the conduct of its enforcements. Iyoha stated that all the billboards and posters blanked out did not meet the pre-exposure vetting requirements of the council, and not because they belonged to the opposition parties. She stressed that the boards on which enforcements were carried out cut across parties. For the avoidance of doubt, she added that APCON required political parties and their candidates to forward their advertisements for pre-exposure vetting. Mrs Iyoha emphasised that political advertisements were vetted to promote sanity and peace of the democratic process.
