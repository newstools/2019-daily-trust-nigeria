A key suspect in the abduction of a 14-year-old boy with albinism has died in police custody in Malawi. Luka Buleya was reported dead this morning after a brief court appearance in the capital Lilongwe yesterday. Mr Buleya’s nephew, Samson Bulaki, said the family were suspicious about his death and showed the BBC pictures of his body with multiple burns. Police said they were waiting for the post-mortem before they discussed the cause of death. Mr Buleya had been accused of ordering two people to kidnap the boy last week in the central region district of Dedza, some 100km south of Lilongwe. The Association of Persons with Albinism head, Overstone Kondowe, said he hoped Mr Buleya’s death would not deny the nation an opportunity to unmask a syndicate and provide leads to a market for body parts.
