The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, has said that the ruling party will win the general elections in a free, fair, transparent and credible manner. He accused the Peoples Democratic Party PDP’s administrations of stealing the people’s mandate in the past by manipulating the electoral process and state institutions. Oshiomhole said this yesterday in Abuja at a joint meeting convened by the APC National Working Committee (NWC) with the Party’s State Chairmen, Secretaries and governorship candidates, held at the National Secretariat in Abuja. Oshiomhole, who presided over the special meeting, said that the meeting was necessary to review and deliberate on the Party’s preparation and general issues ahead of the forthcoming general elections. Oshiomhole stated that the party’s national leadership identified the state executives, represented at the meeting by their respective chairmen and secretaries, as an important grassroots base that will work and ensure the Party’s victory in the presidential, governorship, National and State Houses of Assembly elections. The National Chairman, who hailed the huge turnout of party supporters in the presidential campaign rallies held so far, charged the state executives to work cordially with APC governors and stakeholders in their respective states to ensure the election of all APC candidates.
