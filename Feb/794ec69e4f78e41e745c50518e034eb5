Solicitors of all members of the Zamfara state chapter of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Mamman Nasir & Co. has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to include the names of successful candidates submitted to it by APC. Addressing a press conference on the controversy surrounding APC candidates in Zamfara state, one of the solicitors of the chamber,  Mohammed Sani Katu, said when INEC took the decision of publishing the list of successful candidates in respect of all other political parties and excluded APC, it did not have the APC list and that is why they took the decision of exempting APC. He said, now that INEC has the list from APC national headquarters which was submitted by the national Chairman, Adams Oshiomole, INEC has no alternative than to affix the names of successful candidates from APC. Asked what step will be taking if INEC refuses to include the names of successful candidates, he said, “We have so many ways of getting redress, but you see, when you are persuading someone through a letter,  you will be inflicting an injury on yourself if you say you want to take punitive steps, it is better to try and convince them to the decision on ground and at the same time,  we cannot initiate contempt proceedings.” Governorship/State assembly elections: INEC’s final list excludes APC candidates in Zamfara, Rivers Judgements on Zamfara APC put INEC in difficult position APC can’t field candidates in Zamfara in 2019 – INEC
