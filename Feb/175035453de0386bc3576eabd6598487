Having posted an unprecedented performance in both 2017 and 2018, the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) now has its target jacked up to N8 trillion in 2019. FIRS in 2017, even while the country’s economic activities were slow, at the heels of the exit from recession, announced that it achieved a total collection of N4tn while in 2018 it collected N5.32trn in tax revenue. Mr Tunde Fowler, Executive Chairman of FIRS, while announcing the feat in Lagos, recently, said the service is now targeting N8 trillion for 2019. However experts are looking at the possibility of realizing the new target. Giving a breakdown of the 2018 collection, Fowler said that oil component generated N2.467 trillion (46.38%), while non-oil component was N2.852 trillion (53.62%). He said from audit alone, FIRS collected N212,792 billion from 2,278 cases with a huge reduction in audit cycle. He also noted that while the revenue collection has been increasing steadily over the years, the cost of collection has been going down. “In 2016, we collected N3,307 trillion; in 2017, we collected N4,027 trillion and in 2018 we collected N5,320 trillion. Meanwhile, the cost of collection as a percentage of actual taxes collected has been reducing; in 2016 it was 2.6%, in 2017 it was 2.49% while in 2018 it was 2.14%.” “The service has been making tremendous efforts in also increasing the amount of non-oil revenue it collects. Non-oil collection contributed 64.99% in 2016; in 2017 it contributed 62.25% and in 2018 it contributed 53.62%. This represents the government’s focus on increasing non-oil sources of revenue and the diversification of the Nigerian economy,” Fowler said. The FIRS chairman further noted that the service implemented various initiatives to enhance tax administration and make taxation as easy as possible including the e-payment channel that enables one to pay taxes. Other e-services are the e-Registration, e-Filing, -Stamp Duty and e-Tax Clearance Certificate. “Nigerian taxpayers are embracing the modern way of tax collection introduced by the FIRS through the 6-e solutions. “We are automating the collection of Value Added Tax (VAT) in key sectors which will facilitate reduction in compliance cost in the long term. We are doing system to system integration between banks and FIRS. And I am happy to announce to you that we had a 31% increase year on year in VAT collection in the banks that have gone live between Jan 2017 and Dec 2018 and collected N25bn so far,” he said. “Amongst others, there is also the Government Information Financial Management Information System (GIFMIS), which links FIRS to the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation OAGF for real-time exchange of information and data. “We are also automating the payment of VAT by states through the State Offices of the Accountant General Platform (SAG). This will ensure that we automate and deduct at source and remittance of VAT and WHT from State governments’ contract payments directly to FIRS’s account and so far, collected N13bn,” he added. Also as part of its strategies, the service in September announced that it has begun going after billionaire tax defaulters and at the time pooled N12.7 billion in just one month through that initiative. Are all these initiatives enough to increase the tax collection of the FIRS, and is the N8trn target realistic? Saidu Mohammed, a tax lawyer told Daily Trust that though the target was a bit ambitious, it was not impossible for FIRS to meet its 2019 projection. He said the service’s innovative ways of collecting tax, including its e-tax may not have a huge impact and the service going after billionaire tax defaulters does not necessarily mean they will recover the money at the appropriate time as the defaulters are bound to use the courts to fight back. “The N8trn target seems a bit unrealistic, but for me to say it is impossible, I will not also be sincere, it is possible but they will have to work really hard,” he said. “Regardless of the innovations, the e-tax, I don’t think that will have a huge impact because the N8trn is almost doubling what was generated in 2018. If maybe they added N2trn to the over N5trn recorded in 2018, it would have been fair, making it N7trn. But well, N8trn is not that far up, and it is possible but then I am skeptical, to be honest.” he said. Hamida Mustapha, a tax consultant, however, said it was quite possible for FIRS to meet its target for this year if it continued with its collection strategies, especially going after the wealthy who avoid paying taxes.
