No fewer than 3000 constituents of the Etiosa constituency II have benefited from free dental care, courtesy of the member of Lagos State House of Assembly representing the constituency, Hon. Gbolahan Yishawu. Among the beneficiaries was the leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos Central, Alhaji Tajudeen Olusi. Yishawu, who is the APC candidate for the constituency in the forthcoming elections, said this would be the sixth time he would organise the free dental care for his constituents.  He said the health and wellness of his constituents was of utmost importance to him. “As the representative of the people, it is expedient that I care for my people, which my party stands for. APC is known for progress and we must do the right thing,” he said. Olusi hailed the lawmaker, saying the health of the people should be paramount to anyone in government. Another beneficiary, Emeka Ogbona, said he had been experiencing toothache but was using herbs to suppress the pain. He noted that the free dental care served as a saving grace for him. Also, Alhaji Sikiru Ramon said he had visited the hospital but the money charged was exorbitant and he could not afford it, adding the exercise was a great support for him to check his teeth and clean it up. The dental consultant, Mr. Banjo Olusegun, who was in charge of the exercise, explained that the beneficiaries would have opportunity for extraction, filling, scaling, polishing, surgical extraction and tooth replacement, as well as oral talk on how to have good oral hygiene. Olusegun said, “We observed that majority don’t understand the technique of brushing the teeth and we have made them realise that not until they have issue with their teeth or pain before they go for check-up”.    “Lagos West Senator abandoned constituency for Ogun guber race” 'No regrets having Tinubu as godfather' "I remained in APC because of my constituents"- Bauchi Deputy speaker
