A northern youth group, Northern Youth Stakeholders Forum (NYSF), has reaffirmed its stance for adopting the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar for the forthcoming presidential election. The group made the affirmation on Saturday during its Northwest zonal town hall meeting, held at Mambayya House in Kano, saying they are following the footsteps of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) who earlier endorsed Atiku Abubakar. The Director, Action and Mobilization of the group, Malam Aminu Adam, said the group, which did all they could in 2015 to ensure the victory of President Muhammadu Buhari, has lost confidence in his ability to lead the nation out of its predicament. He said Buhari has fallen short of expectations of the masses as he failed in all the three thematic areas of his campaign, namely security, economy and fight against corruption. Malam Adam said the group has now adopted Atiku Abubakar based on his mental capability, managerial abilities and as an employer of labour especially to the young people, adding however that should Atiku fail to live up to the expectations of the masses if elected, the group will dump him for another candidate. In his speech, the chairman of the occasion Nastura Ashir Sherrif, said Buhari has disappointed the group.  2019: How Buhari, Atiku are tearing Kannywood apart Northern group withdraws support for Atiku, backs Buhari PDP chiefs differ over Atiku endorsement by Northern elders
