The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for AMAC/Bwari Federal Constituency, Micah Jiba, has urged residents not to lose faith in the electoral institution because they are made up of men of integrity despite the postponement of the presidential and National Assembly elections. He said his supporters should be resilient despite the losses they must have incurred from the postponement. “I and my campaign organisation apologise for every inconvenience on behalf of INEC that this decision may cause the electorate. I urge all of them to remain calm and resolute in their decision which they have made to stand by me. The election has just been postponed by one week, to be held on Saturday, February 23, 2019. “I am calling on all residents of the FCT, especially those in AMAC/Bwari Federal Constituency, not to be discouraged or intimidated. They should be patient and law-abiding, because Saturday is just around the corner, for them to cast their votes,” he said. He further expressed confidence that he will be victorious on Saturday, because the God he serves will not deny him of his victory.
