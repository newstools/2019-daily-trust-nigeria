Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Atiku Abubakar has lost his Mayo-Belwa/Jada/Ganye/Toungo‎ Federal Constituency to the All Progressives Congress (APC), Daily Trust reports. The APC candidate in the federal constituency Abdulrazak Namdas, polled a total of ‎62,374 votes to defeat his PDP rival, Kabiru Muktar, who scored 61,436. The returning officer of the constituency, Prof Ismail Haruna, announced the results in Jada, headquarters of the constituency. Namdas, who currently occupies the seat, was one of the political boys to Atiku, but in the wake of the defection of the former vice president from APC to PDP, he declined to follow his former boss. His decision to remain in APC was reportedly hinged on the N22.7 billion contract for the construction of Mayo-Belwa/Jada/Ganye/Toungo road awarded by the Buhari administration for his constituency. Namdas is the only APC member that won election in the Adamawa South senatorial zone.
