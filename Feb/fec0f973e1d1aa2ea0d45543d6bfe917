The Ministry of Interior, Iris Smarts Technology Limited and the Nigeria Security, Printing and Minting PLC have signed an agreement to begin the production of international passports in Nigeria. No date, however, was given by parties involved for the commencement of production. Speaking at MoU signing in Abuja, yesterday the Minister of Interior, Abdulrahman Dambazau said the decision to domesticate the production of passports was taken following numerous challenges being encountered in the current arrangement. “I am glad we have decided that it’s the right thing to do. The platform is already there, it’s only for us to key into it. “Iris has an existing contract with the Nigerian government and they have the technology. They will work with the Nigeria Security, Printing and Minting PLC to actualise this plan,” he said. The Comptroller General of Immigration, Muhammad Babandede said samples will be tested for quality before giving the permission for mass production of the document. On his part, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Nigeria Security, Printing and Minting PLC, Abbas Masanawa promised to deliver quality passports that will compete favourably with those of other top countries.
