Wife of former Vice President, Amina Namadi Sambo, has called on Christians and followers of other religions to be accommodating to hijab users in schools, workplace and other public places. She made the call yesterday at a public lecture to commemorate the 2019 World Hijab Day, organised by the Coalition of Nigerian Muslim Women held in Abuja. Sambo described the persecution of Muslim girls and women on hijab in schools, workplace and public space as the highest form of religious intolerance. “The wearing of hijab is a direct command from Allah to Prophet Muhammad, who instructed him to tell his wives, children and the believing women to wear hijab,’’ she said, noting that the constant harassment and intimidation violated Nigerian Muslim women’s fundamental human rights as enshrined in the constitution. Sambo, however, called for door-to-door campaign on hijab to enlighten Nigerians on the divine obligation of hijab. She also called for more efforts against any attempt to prevent Muslim girls and women from wearing hijab in schools or workplaces. The guest speaker, Dr Hajaratu Sulayman, a consultant gynaecologist at the Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital, Zaria, urged hijab users to live exemplary life.
