Another set of 160 stranded Nigerians from Libya arrived late Thursday with the returnees sharing sad tales of their experiences in the North-African country.
 
One of the returnees, Mrs. Adebisi Komolafe, from Osogbo Osun State, warned the youth against embarking on irregular migration to Libya, saying she would not wish her enemy what she went through. The Coordinator, Lagos Territorial office of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Alh Idris Muhammed received the returnees at the Cargo Wing of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Ikeja Lagos. They were brought back by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), as part of EU’s special intervention on Assisted Voluntary Returnees (AVR) Programme which formally ends in 2020. The returnees arrived aboard a Nouvel Air plane comprising 68 female adults, one female child and five female infants as well as 79 male adults, two male children and five male infants, making 74 females and 86 males, including a psychologically traumatized adult male. Narrating her experience, Komolafe insisted that the situation in Nigeria was better when compared to Libya, noting that Nigerians only needed to be patriotic, have interest of the country at heart and pray for the leaders. “If Nigerians can stop blaming government for everything, with faith and sincerity, our prayers will be accepted by God. “I don’t wish any Nigerian should think of traveling to Libya. I never knew the situation in Libya before I left. If I had known, I wouldn’t have traveled there. Nigeria is far better than that country.” More traumatizing, according to her, was the fact that she could not repatriate any money to Nigeria. The Coordinator, while receiving the returnees, implored other Nigerians still aspiring to travel out of the country to desist from irregular migration. 162 stranded Nigerians arrive from Libya NEMA receives 160 Nigerians from Libya Seven pregnant women, 211 others arrive from Libya
