Venezuelan soldiers have blocked a bridge on the border with Colombia ahead of a shipment of humanitarian aid, the opposition said. The aid is being arranged by opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who declared himself interim president last month. But it is not clear how the aid will be distributed. President Nicolás Maduro, who has the support of the army, has rejected letting it into the country. Venezuela is in the grip of a worsening humanitarian crisis. Military officers used a tanker truck and a cargo container to block access to the Tienditas bridge, which links Cucuta, Colombia to Urena, Venezuela, opposition politician Franklyn Duarte told AFP. “Troops from the armed forces are blocking the pass”, he said. Other opposition leaders appealed to the military to allow aid trucks to cross the border. “You know there’s a red line, you know well there’s a limit, you know that medicines, food and medical supplies are that limit,” said lawmaker Miguel Pizarro.
