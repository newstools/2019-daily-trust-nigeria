The national grid has soared to 5,375 megawatts (MW) power generation, the highest figure ever attained in Nigeria. The grid also sustained 5,000MW peak generation trend for seven days so far this month. Data on daily power generation obtained by Daily Trust on Monday shows that the highest 5,375MW peak generation was reached last Thursday. The last time Nigeria reached a nearer threshold was in December 2017 when the peak generation rode to 5,222MW. For at least seven days in February 2019, the grid has recorded power generation that was over 5,000MW, records from the Independent System Operation (ISO), a section of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) indicated. The breakdown shows that the grid had 5,033MW on February 2 and 3. It dropped to 5,014MW last Tuesday and rose to 5,147MW Wednesday last week. By Thursday, the 5,375MW highest threshold was reached. The trend dropped on Friday to 5,003MW and further slid to 5,001MW last Saturday, the documents claimed. The lowest generation during the review period was greater at over 3,600MW than it was in January 2018. The latest lowest generation as at Saturday was 3,810MW; this was higher than peak generation of 3,785MW attained on January 26, 2019. Currently, available power generation capacity stands at 7,652MW which can be deployed to the grid with adequate gas fuel for the 24 gas-fired power plants and enough water level for the three hydropower plants. TCN said the transmission wheeling capacity stands at 8,100MW, away from the 7,000MW capacity recorded in December 2017.
