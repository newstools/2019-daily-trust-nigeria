The Waziri Hausa and a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kwara State, Yakubu Gobir, has advised Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to change the ballot papers  to prevent rigging. Gobir however noted that the sudden postponement of Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections by INEC shown that Nigeria’s democracy is still at its infancy. The APC chieftain suggested to INEC to completely change the ballot papers and introduce security features so as to avoid any form of rigging adding that the commission would have made use of NSPMC instead of local suppliers in the printing of the ballot papers and other election materials. He alleged that some political parties had spent billions of naira in the run up of Saturday’s elections to sway voters which according to him, is difficult again to come by before the new date fixed for another round of elections. He reminded INEC that all eyes are on the commission as history would judge Professor Mahmoud Yakubu and his team as the political situation in the country unfolds.
