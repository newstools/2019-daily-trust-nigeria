The APC House of Representatives candidate for Makurdi/Guma Federal Constituency of Benue State, Engr. Conrad Terhide Utaan, yesterday, accused Governor Samuel Ortom and PDP in the state of planning to unleash terror during the Saturday elections. Utaan had alleged at a press conference in Makurdi, that the governor and his party had imported military and police uniforms which they intended to give their armed militia under the guise of livestock guards. “In the next few days based on information we have gathered, Governor Samuel Ortom and the PDP plan to unleash mayhem and violence in areas where they believe they would not have support,” Utaan alleged. In a swift reaction, however, the governor and the PDP dismissed the accusation, saying the APC and its candidate were already jittery of the defeat ahead of them at the polls. Governor Ortom through his Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, noted that the APC was already in a panic mood and as such could go to any extent to blackmail him.
