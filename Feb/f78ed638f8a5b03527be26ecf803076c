The Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Lieutenant General Tukur Buratai has said unpatriotic groups and foreign conspirators were planning to scuttle the 2019 general elections. He made this known today during the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Operational Conference with Principal Staff Officers (PSO) Grand Officers Commanding (GOC) and selected field commanders held in Abuja. Buratai said: “We have information of subversive motives by some unpatriotic groups aided by foreign conspirators to scuttle the peaceful conduct of the 2019 General Elections in some parts of the country.” He warned such detractors to mend their ways, adding that the Nigerian Army was working with the Nigeria Police and other security agencies to ensure an enabling environment for citizens to exercise their civic rights. Buratai said: “In this regard, GOCs and field Commanders at all levels are to deal decisively with any form of security breach.” He also told the officers not to lose sight of current activities in Operation Lafiya Dole, fighting Boko Haram in the North East and other operations across the country.
