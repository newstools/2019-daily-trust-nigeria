Saudi Arabia said it will work to de-escalate tensions between India and Pakistan, ahead of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salmanâ€™s arrival in Delhi. The prince is on a tour of Asia and has just visited Pakistan. Hostilities between Delhi and Islamabad flared last week, after a suicide bombing in the India-administered part of Kashmir killed at least 40 paramilitary police. A Pakistan-based militant group, Jaish-e-Mohammad, said it was behind it. Pakistan denies any role in the bombing, but India has accused the state of being complicit and vowed to isolate its neighbour internationally. Both India and Pakistan claim all of Muslim-majority Kashmir, but control only parts of it.
