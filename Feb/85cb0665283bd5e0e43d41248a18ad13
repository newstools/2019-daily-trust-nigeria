US President Donald Trump says a woman who left the US to become a propagandist for the Islamic State (IS) group will not be allowed to return. On Twitter, he said he had instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo “not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the country”. Mr Pompeo had earlier stated that the 24-year-old was not a US citizen and would not be admitted. However, her family and her lawyer maintain that she has US citizenship. Ms Muthana, who grew up in Alabama, travelled to Syria to join IS when she was 20. She had told her family she was going to a university event in Turkey. The case has similarities to that of UK-born teenager Shamima Begum who has been stripped of her British citizenship. Ms Begum fled London to join IS in 2015 but has now said she wants to return to the UK.
