The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) is to collaborate with the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) in licensing aviation personnel, especially pilots. The Director General of NCAA, Capt. Muhtar Usman, said most countries, especially the United States of America (USA), had tied social security number with aviation personnel licenses. Capt. Usman stated this after he completed his enrolment for the National Identification Number (NIN) last week at the NIMC headquarters in Abuja, a statement from NCAA yesterday indicated. “In the USA, they have tied the Social Security Number with pilots/aviation personnel licenses because of the importance of having one standard data, and NCAA can also do the same,” the DG said. He expressed appreciation to the management of NIMC on the easy process of enrolling into the National Identity Database (NIDB). According to him, it is a laudable project by the Federal Government to ensure that all Nigerians and legal residents are properly enrolled, identified and issued an identification number.
