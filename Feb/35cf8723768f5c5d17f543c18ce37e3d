The Nigerian Army (NA) has warned its personnel against involvement in political activities during the forthcoming 2019 general elections. The spokesman of the army, Colonel Sagir Musa said the attention of the army was drawn to an allegation of involvement of one of its officers in politics in Rivers State which was found to be untrue. He said the army would have ordinarily ignored such insinuations but for unsuspecting members of the public who may be misled to believe the unsubstantiated allegations. He said, the army has made it clear that none of its personnel will be involved in political campaigns, escort of VIPs for political missions and above all, aiding or supporting any political party as has been circulated in official circulars and statements. Musa said, “Although a detailed press statement has been released, the need to further make the position of the Nigerian Army clearer is therefore imperative.” He said, “Our Rules of Engagement and Code of Conduct have not assigned any political role to the Army in this regard.” “The Army’s involvement starts and ends with the provision of a peaceful and secure environment for the conduct of 2019 General Elections,” he added. He also said, “The Nigerian army strongly believes that citizens, like responsible media, have complementary constitutional roles to play, especially towards ensuring national security, information management, peace, and safety of Nigerians.” “The Army will continue to achieve and sustain constructive engagement, obedience to the rule of law and obedience to constituted authority at all time in the spirit of civil-military relations,” Musa stated. He urged members of the public to ignore information attributed to the Nigerian Army that are contrary to its core values, professionalism, respect for others and open declaration on the rules of engagement.
