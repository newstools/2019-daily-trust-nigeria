A coalition of youth organisations, Committee of Youth on Mobilisation and Sensitisation (CYMS) has urged young people in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to make the right decision by voting for President Muhammadu Buhari in the presidential elections. The coalition in a communiqué after its national conference in Abuja said government should provide basic welfare, health insurance and security for young people because they are the future of the country. The communiqué read by the coalition’s Director General, Obinna Nwaka, said the incoming administration should be able to sustain the various youth empowerment programmes such as the N-Power, Anchor Borrowers and school feeding hence the need to re-elect President Muhammadu Buhari and his vice, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo. “After much assessment of all the presidential candidates and their antecedents, the Committee of Youth on Mobilisation and Sensitisation has come to agree to vote for President Muhammadu Buhari to continue the good works that he has started to take Nigeria to the next level,” he said.  He however urged youths to contribute to good governance by shunning money bag politics and vote buying. “The CYMS appreciate the conduct of the all the various political parties and their candidates in ensuring a hitch free and credible election and call on all Nigerian youths to go all out and vote peacefully without rancour,” he said.
