Kogi State Deputy Governor, Elder Simon Achuba has said his security details, earlier withdrawn, have been restored after the press conference he addressed. Achuba had, on Sunday, raised the alarm that his life and those of his family members were in danger following the withdrawal of all his security details by the ADC to the state governor. In a statement, signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Akor Sylvester and made available to newsmen in Lokoja today, the Deputy Governor said his security details have been restored in full yesterday night and have since resumed duties. He commended the Acting Inspector General of Police and the Kogi State Commissioner of Police for their prompt responses to his call. The Deputy Governor enjoined the Police State Command to monitor the subordinate officers they send to sensitive duty posts to guard them against being used for unlawful assignments that could tarnish the image of the police. He also commended the press for their courage and professionalism which principally assisted in getting the information out to the public.
