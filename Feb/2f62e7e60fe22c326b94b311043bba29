The Kogi State Command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) yesterday said it had deployed over 2,500 officers to flash points in Kogi East, Central and Western part of the state ahead of the forthcoming elections. Its  commandant, Philips Ayodele, disclosed this in Lokoja during a sensitization programme for officers under his command on intelligent gathering  ahead of the forthcoming general election. Ayodele said the command identified some grey areas and measures had been put in place to ensure citizens exercise their franchise without intimidation or fears. He said the sensitization program would help his officers know their rights and how to collaborate with people to address issues concerning election. “We have been arranging series of lectures in the build up to this election. “We are aware that some desperate  politicians will be recruiting thugs to cause mayhem on election day. “This won’t be allowed to happen. We have also taken note of the destruction of some party billboard by unknown individuals across the three senatorial districts. “The Command has placed its officers in strategic areas and anyone caught will face the full wrath of the law,” he said.
