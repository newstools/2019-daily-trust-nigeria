Iranians have taken to the streets across the country to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1979 revolution, renewing their allegiance to the country’s Islamic principles at a time of rising economic and political pressure amid the resumption of punishing US sanctions. In his address to the demonstrators gathered at Tehran’s Azadi (Freedom) Square on Monday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani dismissed US efforts to isolate Tehran, saying US sanctions could not break the Islamic Republic. “The presence of people today on the streets all over Islamic Iran … means that the enemy will never reach its evil objectives,” Rouhani said, adding that the country will continue to pursue its missile programme to defend the country from external threats. “We have not asked, and will never ask for permission in developing our missile arsenal as we continue to pursue our path to military might.” IRAN: We’r facing the toughest economic situation in 40ys – Rouhani Rouhani vows to end isolation amid fresh US sanctions Swing song on Iran’s nuke
