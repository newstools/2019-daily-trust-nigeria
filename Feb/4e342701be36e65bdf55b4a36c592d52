The Minister of Defence, Mansur Dan-Ali has said new technological and economic initiatives are important in addressing some issues around the farmers, herders’ violent conflicts. He spoke yesterday while receiving the report of the committee set up to look into the immediate and remote cause of the conflict. The committee which was inaugurated by the defence minister on 11 September 2018 was also mandated to make recommendations to end the conflict. Dan-Ali said violent conflicts between nomadic herders and agrarian communities in Nigeria have escalated in recent years, threatening national security and political stability. He noted that the clashes are becoming potentially dangerous as the Boko Haram insurgency in the northeast and the Lake Chad region. He said the government has taken steps to address the problem, through efforts to reform livestock management practices, address negative environmental trends and curb the cross-border movement of both cattle rustlers and armed herders. He also said the country’s judicial system should be strengthened to handle cases from both farmers and herders who take the law into their hands. He said the federal government would study the report of the committee with a view of adopting its recommendations.
