To celebrate the ICCD, the Programme Officer, Dorcas Cancer Foundation, Mr. Korede Akindele, said their gesture was to relieve parents of children living with cancer the truma, saying that they need to be supported. “Today is the international world child cancer day, Dorcas foundation came to do something with the children. This is how we do it every year, we come to the ward to see the children and how we can support them and social support. The role of Dorcas foundation is just to support the parents, to keep them strong in the process and to also see how we can help them.” He said. He said they were prevented from doing more for children living with cancer because of paucity of funds, calling on organizations and individuals to also come to the aid of the children. “So far we have been able to help over 30 children and we still want to help more. Currently on our waiting list, we have over seven children that we have not been able to help and we want to help them. With the support of people, we will able to help them.” he said. The Supply Chain Analyst,  Sahara group Mr. Segun Ogunkua promised to assist the children financially, saying that the organization wants to help eradicate the stigma around cancer.
