The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has commenced sensitisation programmes for corps members in the Federal Capital Territory towards the forthcoming general elections. Speaking, yesterday, to the corps members at Kubwa orientation camp, the FCT INEC Admin Secretary, Mr. Nick Dazang, said they were trained earlier on how to go about their task but the sensitisation programme was to remind them and get them familiar with what they would expect on the field. He urged them to allow themselves to be used to make history as the election was a moment to be used to define history in Nigeria. Dazang said adequate security had been provided for the corps members as INEC was in collaboration with the security agencies concerning their safety. He urged them to educate voters on the procedures of voting hence, they should read their manuals to guide them while carrying out their task on the field. The director general of the NYSC, Major General Suleiman Kazaure, through the Assistant Director, Human Resources of the scheme, Mrs Grace Ogbuogebe, urged the corps members not to disappoint the scheme while carrying out their duties. He assured them that their safety was well taken care of but that they should be vigilant while on duty. Kazaure warned the corps members not to receive any form of gratification from any politician or political party and not to compromise in any form. In case of any threat of insecurity, he urged them to call on their state coordinator or any number of the security agencies provided them.
