About 40,000 residents of Rann, Kala-Balge Local Government Area of Borno State, Nigeria, who were chased out of their community by incessant Boko Haram attacks to Goura in the neighbouring Cameroon three weeks ago, have been sent back home. The Field Communication Officer of Doctors Without Borders (MSF) Maiduguri, Abdulkareem Yakubu, said in a statement yesterday that these Nigerian refugees “are now leaving Cameroon after being told to go home.” Abdulkareem quoted Stephanie Remion, MSF Emergency Coordinator in Goura, Cameroon, as saying: “Today we are seeing people packing up their belongings and leaving for Rann (Nigeria) after being told by Cameroonian and Nigerian authorities to leave.” The MSF urged the governments of Cameroon and Nigeria to protect these vulnerable people and ensure they can seek safety where they choose and where they have access to essential means such as shelter, food and medical care.” 10,000 Nigerians seek shelter in Cameroon, Niger As Buhari meets Cameroon’s Biya...
