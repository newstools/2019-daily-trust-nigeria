The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar has accused his APC counterpart, President Muhammadu Buhari of being behind the postponement of this year’s general elections. Atiku in a statement this morning by his Special Adviser on Media, Mr. Paul Ibe said Buhari’s agenda is to disenfranchise Nigerians who were ready to come out en mass and vote for the PDP. The former Vice President however, called on the electorate to remain calm and put the APC to shame by voting massively for PDP in the rescheduled February 23 and March 9, polls. “This postponement is obviously a case of the hand of Esau but the voice of Jacob. “By instigating this postponement, the Buhari administration hopes to disenfranchise the Nigerian electorate in order to ensure that turn out is low on the rescheduled date. “Knowing that the Nigerian people are determined to reject them, they are desperate and will do anything in their power to avoid their rejection by the Nigerian people. “Their plan is to provoke the public, hoping for a negative reaction, and then use that as an excuse for further anti-democratic acts. “As such, I call on all Nigerians to be patient. “We have tolerated the maladministration of this government for four years. We can extend our tolerance a few more days and give them our verdict via our votes. “Maintain the peace and be law abiding. Do not react to this provocation with anger, violence or any action that might be exploited by those who do not want this election to hold. Remain calm. We will overcome this. You can postpone an election, but you cannot postpone destiny,” he said.
