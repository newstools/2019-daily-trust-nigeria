Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has announced he is closing the border with Brazil on Thursday night as a row over foreign humanitarian aid continues. The embattled leftist leader went on TV to say that he was also considering shutting the border with Colombia to stop the opposition bringing in relief. He denies any crisis and calls the aid delivery plans a US-orchestrated show. Opposition leader Juan Guaidó is leading a convoy to the Colombian border from the capital Caracas. Mr Guaidó declared himself interim leader during anti-government protests last month and is recognised by dozens of foreign states. Buses forming his convoy set off from the city on Thursday to cheering crowds. Mr Guaidó and his allies hope to collect food and medicine in defiance of President Maduro. The Venezuelan military has so far managed to block shipments of US aid from coming across the border with Colombia. Despite denying there is any humanitarian crisis, Mr Maduro announced this week that 300 tonnes of aid would be shipped to Venezuela from its ally Russia.
