A 30-year-old housewife, Jimoh Joke, has pleaded with an Ado-Ekiti customary court to dissolve her six-year-old marriage to her husband, Ige Jimoh, on grounds of constant beating. Joke said Jimoh lacked any respect for her parents, and once sent her out of their matrimonial home without allowing her to take her belongings out with her. The petitioner, a resident on Kajola Street, Ikere-Ekiti, told the court yesterday that her husband didn’t do the introduction tradition when she got pregnant for him, neither did he pay any dowry on her. She said Jimoh always accused her of infidelity, an allegation she said was not true, adding he was very aggressive and would always beat her unnecessarily. The mother of two said her husband wouldn’t take care of the children in the marriage and she was the one responsible for their welfare and school fees. She urged the court to dissolve the union and award her custody of their two children, six-year-old Victor and three-year-old Ireoluwa. Jimoh, 35, who denied beating his wife frequently, accused her of “sleeping around.” He said Joke wouldn’t take care of their children “despite the fact I was always giving her money for their upkeep.” The respondent urged the court to dissolve the marriage as she was already married to another man and was four months pregnant. Jimoh did not oppose the prayer, neither did he object to Joke having custody of the children as sought by her. The court president, Mr Orejimi Kayode, after hearing from both parties, adjourned the case till February 28, 2019 for judgment.
