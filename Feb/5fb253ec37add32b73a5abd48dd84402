President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday in Makurdi, the Benue State capital, promised to remain consistent and steadfast in his pursuit for a better Nigeria. President Buhari spoke during the APC presidential mega rally held at the Aper Aku Stadium in Makurdi. Buhari said, “I’m going to be consistent and steadfast. An-ybody who steals will be prosecuted and their loot collect-ed.” The president who alighted from his car at the venue at exactly 12:24pm amid cheers from the crowd who momen-tarily overwhelmed security control shouting “Sai baba”, urged the Benue people to vote all APC candidates in the general elections. The president thanked the Benue people for the rousing welcome he received, emphasising that he was convinced that they believed in what his administration was doing and urged them to further support the APC. Buhari recalled that when he went to seek the state’s votes in 2015, he promised three things: check insecurity, improve economy and fight corruption, added that he deliv-ered on those promises. He maintained that Benue was relatively peaceful when he came in 2015 unlike states in the North East which were ravaged by insurgency to the extent that Boko Haram oc-cupied 17 local government areas in Borno, but that now, the insurgents no longer held a single local government ar-ea. “We’re doing much better now,” he posited.
