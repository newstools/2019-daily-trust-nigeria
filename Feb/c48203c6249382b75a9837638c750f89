The Federal Government recently issued an order allowing APM Terminals Apapa to hire female employees to work the night shift – furthering the terminal management’s efforts to promote gender diversity and inclusion within the organisation. Director Akpan O.U. of the Trade Union Services & Industrial Relations under the Federal Ministry of Labour and Productivity signed the grant of permit order on 21 January 2019, citing sufficient physical provisions and the company’s robust maternity policy. The ministry’s order also requires APM Terminals Apapa to comply with the provisions of Convention 171 or the Night Work Convention of the International Labour Organisation, a United Nations specialised agency aimed at promoting rights at work, encouraging decent employment opportunities, enhancing social protection, and strengthening dialogue on work-related issues. Nigeria is a member State of ILO. “APM Terminals is deeply committed to advance diversity and inclusion across the organisation and we are delighted to have the support of the government in cultivating this culture. “Securing this permit is an important first step in building an inclusive workplace where all talents have the same opportunity to grow and achieve their full potential,” says Aniemeka Umeonyido, APM Terminals Apapa Head of Human Resources.
