A court in the Maldives has ordered the country’s former President Abdulla Yameen be held in state custody until the end of a trial on money laundering charges, according to local media. At a hearing at the criminal court in the Maldives’ capital, Male, on Monday, prosecutors alleged the former president tried to bribe a witness in the prosecution’s case to change their testimony, reported the news websites Mihaaru and Avas. Yameen was taken to a remand centre on Maafushi, an island near Male, a police spokesperson said.
