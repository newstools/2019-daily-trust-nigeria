The leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, has urged his members to call off the proposed boycott of elections in the entire South-east region. According to Kanu, the decision to call-off the boycott was reached following wide consultations with stakeholders. Kanu had earlier told his followers that elections could hold in any part of the zone on the condition of a referendum to determine the sovereignty of Biafra. In a statement on Friday by the group’s Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, which was made available to newsmen in Anambra, IPOB lifted the boycott order, saying that all terms and conditions they put forward had been met by those wishing them to lift the ban on voting. The statement reads in parts: “It is important we notify the world at large and the indefatigable global IPOB family in particular that our supreme leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, has called-off the election boycott in Biafraland. “After a brief emergency session of the Directorate of State late last night presided over by our leader, it was determined that all our terms and conditions had been met by those wishing us to lift the ban on voting; it was unanimously agreed that the boycott should be lifted. “The signed document agreed to IPOB terms and conditions are in our possession and will be made public in due course. “We can, therefore, state with utmost sense of responsibility and pride that IPOB has accomplished what no other people or group has been able to do in the history of our people. “Without prejudice, this will go down as the defining moment when the irreversibility of the restoration of Biafra was firmly entrenched in the subconscious of all and sundry. “As a result of which we can state categorically that Biafra is a lot closer than we think as a result of this.” BSS: Inside Kanu’s ‘Secret Army’ How Nnamdi Kanu fell from ‘grace’ 2019: Rep dismisses Kanu’s call for election boycott in South-East
