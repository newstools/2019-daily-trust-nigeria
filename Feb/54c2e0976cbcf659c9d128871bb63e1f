Pakistan has reiterated its call on India to be more committed to ending Kashmir crisis in accordance with the rights of Kashmiris to self-determination through plebiscite. The disputed territory continues to be one of the longest unresolved conflicts between India and Pakistan as both states claim it in its entirety. “This problem is a potential source of conflict in the region. We want it resolved,” Pakistan High Commissioner to Nigeria, Waqar Ahmad Kingravi told journalists in Abuja at a briefing ahead of Kashmir Solidarity Day billed for February 5, 2019. He said the Kashmir issue was not getting due emphasis on the global stage, adding that the solidarity day was to highlight the problem in the occupied territory to the world “that there is a responsibility of the international community to help the Kashmiris get their rights of self-determination.” The envoy also urged the global community to pressure India to end its brutalities against peaceful protestors in occupied Kashmir. Pakistan, Kingravi said, demanded unfettered access to a UN sponsored fact finding mission to visit Indian-occupied Kashmir to access the ground situation, investigate atrocities and punish the culprits.  We also demand immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners in Kashmir and removal of restrictions on their movements, he added.
