The National Chairman of the Providence Peoples Congress (PPC), Mr. Benson Adetona, has said Nigerians should not see other political parties as a burden. Mr. Benson said the two dominant parties- the PDP and the APC, were but one, and that they were responsible for the woes of the country. In his state of the nation press conference in Lagos, the PPC chairman, flanked by the party’s presidential candidate, Pastor Victor Okhai, declared that many Nigerians were tired of the two parties. He said it was high time Nigerians gave other political parties a chance; and not see them as a burden. The PPC, one of the nation’s political parties established in 2013, has 30 senatorial, 70 House of Representatives and 15 governorship candidates contesting on its platform. The PPC chairman said Nigerians should discern which of the other political parties truly represented the people and would fight for their betterment. He reiterated that Nigeria could not afford to go through the current harrowing experience it was passing through.
