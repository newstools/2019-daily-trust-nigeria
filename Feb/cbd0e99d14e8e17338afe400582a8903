The African Democratic Congress (ADC) in Plateau State has denied reports that its candidate for the House of Representatives seat for Jos North/Bassa Federal Constituency, Abdulmajid Lawal, has stepped down from the race. The state party chairman, Sabiu Ibrahim Musa, who debunked the reports while speaking to Daily Trust correspondent, said the rumour was the work of detractors bent on blackmailing their candidate to step down for the candidate of APC in the state. Daily Trust reports that the Ulama and Elder’s Council in Plateau State had last week endorsed all the candidates of the APC for the presidential and National Assembly elections. The endorsement had irked candidates of other political parties with rumour making the rounds that the candidates would succumb to the council’s decision. However, Musa said their candidate was not an independent candidate but a candidate of the party, warning that any attempt to step aside for another candidate would force the party to take legal action against him. “We want to state categorically that our candidate has not stepped down for anybody and would not step down. He is popular and has done his homework. Those who have not done their homework are afraid of his popularity, let the people decide who they want on the day of election,” he said. Our correspondent could not speak with Lawal but a source close to the candidate told Daily Trust that the decision of the council to endorse the APC candidate was unfair and aimed at tarnishing the political career of other candidates.
