The Akwa Ibom community in Abuja and the 19 northern states has denied endorsing any candidate for the March 9 governorship election in the state. They told newsmen in Abuja that it was not the policy of the community to endorse the candidate of any political party during elections. The Trustee and Dean of President, Akwa  Ibom Federal Constituency, Akparawa Dominic Mbah, denounced a purported endorsement of one of the governorship candidates. According to him, the main business of the Akwa Ibom community in FCT and the 19 northern states was for the welfare of the indigenes of the state. “It was surprising to read the purported endorsement of the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Nsima Ekere, by the community. “This will serve as a platform for us to refute what was widely acclaimed as an endorsement of a governorship candidate by Abuja residents and the 19 northern states of Akwa Ibom extraction. It couldn’t have been without consultation and we would not have even endorsed anybody. “It was surprising to us as members of trustees, patrons, and elders of the community to witness an endorsement of one of our sons, in the person of Nsima Ekere as APC governorship candidate. “It was a personal endorsement and not in our names. If we were to endorse anybody, the governor visited us, he did all we asked him to do and he made some promises, he fulfilled some, waiting to fulfill the others. If we were the kind of people, it would have been right for us to say we have endorsed the sitting governor of our state but we never did,” Mbah said.
