The ruling APC has said it will not get tired of reminding the PDP and its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, that Nigerians will never return to Egypt. The APC National Publicity Secretary, Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, who addressed journalists yesterday in Abuja, said the era of unbridled corruption and impunity was one mission the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government was determined to fight and win under a free, fair and credible electoral process, with the support of well-meaning Nigerians. After Wednesday night’s televised town hall meeting tagged: “The Candidates”, attended by Atiku Abubakar and his running mate, Mr. Peter Obi, Malam Issa-Onilu said a redefinition of their presidential campaign slogan, “Let’s loot Nigeria again” was now trending heavily in the social media. He said going by Atiku and Obi’s shocking confession that their administration would grant amnesty to looters, the party aligned with the wide section of Nigerians who were now clear of their intentions if elected and therefore appreciated the collective need to stop them. He said the insistence of Atiku and PDP to take Nigeria through the “dangerous route” where the nation’s economic policies and programmes were driven mainly by the interests of leaders, their local friends and foreign partners constituted a present danger every well-meaning Nigerian must rise against.
