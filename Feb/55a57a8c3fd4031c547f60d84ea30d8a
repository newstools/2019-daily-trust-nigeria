The presidential candidate of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar, has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to place national interest above partisanship. In a statement yesterday in Abuja by his Special Adviser on Media, Paul Ibe, Atiku said he was committed to peaceful polls. The former vice president urged all Nigerians to peacefully troop out in their numbers on Saturday to vote according to their conscience. “We wish to make known to these individuals the fact that Nigeria has long-standing friends, and it will be myopic to burn those bridges on the altar of desperation. “Atiku Abubakar wishes to reaffirm to Nigerians and the world his commitment to peace and democracy and urges all contestants and parties involved in the 2019 Nigerian elections to publicly do the same. “Atiku Abubakar also notes the harassment of friends of Nigeria by the Buhari administration and its agents and privies, who have taken to releasing and uttering statements threatening diplomats and election observers,” he said.
