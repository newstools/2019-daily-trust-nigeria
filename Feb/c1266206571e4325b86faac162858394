The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, says a meeting of the Expanded National Caucus of the party has resolved that the Feb. 23 election date for the presidential and National Assembly elections must remain sacrosanct. Oshiomhole, in a communique issued at the end of the meeting, said issues of logistics and other foreseeable challenges must be addressed to ensure the elections do not suffer any hitch. The caucus urged the security agencies to step up their activities by ensuring that all those involved in violence, ballot box snatching, and falsification of results should face the full weight of the law. Daily Trust reports that the APC meeting also alleged that the list of presiding officers in states and local government areas published by INEC prior to the aborted February 16 elections contained names of mostly PDP card carrying members. The communique, therefore, urged INEC to take steps to correct this anomaly to ensure fairness and credibility of the electoral process. It also expressed curiosity that certain leaders of PDP had full knowledge of the plan to postpone the elections several hours before INEC made the unfortunate announcement. The caucus therefore urged INEC to demonstrate its independence and neutrality beyond doubts in all its activities before, during and after the period of elections.
