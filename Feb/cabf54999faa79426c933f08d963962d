A suicide bomber killed at least 27 members of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards on Wednesday, Tasnim news agency said, in a region where security forces are facing a rise in attacks by militants from the country’s Sunni Muslim minority. The Sunni group Jaish al Adl (Army of Justice), which says it wants greater rights for the ethnic minority Baluchis, claimed responsibility for the attack, the semi-official Fars reported. A suicide bomber driving a vehicle laden with explosives attacked a bus transporting members of the Guards, the force said. A video posted by Fars showed blood and debris at the site of the attack on the road between the cities of Zahedan and Khash, a volatile area near the Pakistan border where militants and drug smugglers operate.
