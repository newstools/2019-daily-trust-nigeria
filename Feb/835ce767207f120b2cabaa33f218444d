The Emir of Kano, Malam Muhammad Sanusi II has expressed concern over the increasing political violence in the state and urged security agencies to do everything possible to tame the situation. Addressing a press conference on Tuesday in Kano, the Emir said: “Information at our disposal indicated that there was political violence in the past two days in the metropolis and that some innocent people were attacked and properties were destroyed. This is condemnable and security agencies must stop it. “It is unfortunate that spilling of blood of innocent people in the name of politics means nothing to some people so long as they achieve their political goals. The politicians, the security agencies and other stakeholders must do something to address this ugly trend. “Our security agents must sit up in discharging their responsibilities as law enforcement agents to protect the lives and properties of the citizens. They must address the situation before it degenerate to lawlessness.” Emir Sanusi II warned politicians to call their followers to order with a view to conducting peaceful elections in Kano state and the nation in general, saying without peace nothing could be achieved. He emphasized that politicians must do everything possible to sanitise politics in the state, noting that “politics is opinion and everybody is entitle to his/her opinion. It is just a matter of voting candidates of your choice whom you believe can steers the affairs of his constituents with fairness and justice and who will better the lives of his subjects.” The Emir called on the people of Kano to conduct themselves well before, during and after election for peace to reign in the state. He said the Kano emirate council was concerned about the peace and harmony in the state.
