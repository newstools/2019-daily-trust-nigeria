Commercial bike riders also known as Okada, at the early hours of Saturday, made brisk business before the commencement of the election. Some of them, who were seen transporting passengers to various destinations, said they made profits as commercial taxis were few because of the restrictions. Aliyu Shina, who spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ilorin, said “this morning is exceptional, though there is restriction, people still have to move especially to their voting units. “Business this morning is good, so far I have made about N1500 within two hours. “I did not overcharge, you can see that the streets are filled with passengers, we can move faster than cars and I think that is the advantage,” he said. Another respondent, who simply identified himself as Kayode, said that early morning business has been very profitable. “I wish elections will continue like this because we have the taxis to compete with us, we are doing our business without hindrance. “Today, I pray there will be no violence, we want to vote and not fight to die”, he said. Ibrahim Abdullahi said: “I have been out since 5.00 am, and I can tell you it is a good day already. “People are moving in haste this morning to reach one or two places before the exercise. “Some to their shops, some to people’s home that is closer to their polling units, it is a day of money for me,” he said. NAN reports that although there is a restriction from 6.00 a.m. to 6.00 p.m., there is still vehicular movement as at 7 45 a.m. (NAN) Inside world of Lagos female commercial tricycle riders In Lagos, residents use phones to call Okada In Lagos, Okada riders go ‘digital’
