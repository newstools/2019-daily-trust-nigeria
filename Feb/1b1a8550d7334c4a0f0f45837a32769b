The Ekiti State governor, Kayode Fayemi, yesterday flagged off N213.6 million community projects across the state with a promise of more of such projects across the country if President Mohammadu Buhari is re-elected in the February 16, 2019 presidential election. Fayemi urged Nigerians to support Pres Buhari in order to enjoy more of such community projects. The governor, who flagged off the distribution of counterpart funds to 37 communities in the first phase of his governmentâ€™s move to complete all outstanding World Bank-powered community projects that he had started during his first tenure, disclosed that work had already begun on completing all uncompleted five-kilometre roads in the 16 local government areas of the state. There were 82 outstanding community projects, including culverts, drainages, town halls and community clinics.
