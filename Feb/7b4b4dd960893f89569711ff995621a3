Gishiri residents in the FCT at Unit 024B, Estate 11 Gishiri village, who voted in the presidential and National Assembly elections, said they voted peacefully in spite of challenges because they were tired of violence. The challenges ranged from absence  of INEC staff to some people with voters cards not finding their names on the register. Mr Umaru Ibrahim, a voter, said he was told to go to Gwarimpa or Jabi, same kilometres away, to check for his name. “There’s no movement so how can I go to Gwarimpa or Jabi? I voted here in 2015 how come my name disappeared today,” he queried? Elizabeth Joseph had the same story to tell. “How can they say my name is not on their register when I voted in this same place in 2015? “No INEC staff is here to talk to but only NYSC ad hoc staff who cannot  help us.  If they say we should not vote we will peacefully go home and rest.” When NAN spoke with the ad-hoc staff, they said that they did not receive any response to calls placed to INEC. They said they were  instructed not to allow anyone whose name was not on the register to vote. The residents, who spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), said they endured the long queue and scorching sun, simply to vote for candidates of their choice. Two party agents from the PDP and APC who pleaded anonymity, said they encouraged their party faithful to remain calm even in the face of the challenges. NAN reports that the turnout of voters was massive, with heavily armed police presence. The INEC ad hoc staff arrived at 8.02am and accreditation and voting started at 9a.m. for the 1,698 accredited voters with PDP winning at the two units.
