US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro’s “days are numbered” after deadly clashes over humanitarian aid. “Picking exact days is difficult. I’m confident that the Venezuelan people will ensure that Maduro’s days are numbered,” Mr Pompeo told CNN. Two people died in Saturday’s clashes between civilians and troops loyal to Mr Maduro, who blocked aid deliveries. Self-declared interim President Juan Guaidó said Mr Maduro must resign. Mr Guaidó also called on other nations to consider “all measures” to oust Mr Maduro after opposition-led efforts to bring in aid descended into clashes. Mr Guaidó said he would attend a meeting of mostly Latin American countries in Colombia on Monday, despite being under a travel ban imposed by Mr Maduro.
