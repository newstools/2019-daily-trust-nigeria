The PDP says the stepping down of some presidential candidates of various political parties for President Muhammadu Buhari is a ploy to swindle the Presidency. Addressing a press conference, yesterday in Abuja, the Director Media and Publicity of the PDP Presidential Campaign Organisation, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, said the last minute endorsement would not stop Buhari’s defeat in the tomorrow’s poll. He called on the president and the APC to be ready to accept defeat. “If candidates of other political parties shelved their ambition for Buhari, it is a ploy to swindle him. So, we are not worried about it,” he said. 2019: Igbo support for Buhari unshakable, says Nwosu Buhari’s biggest hurdles ahead 2019 polls As deadline expires: No case against Buhari’s election
