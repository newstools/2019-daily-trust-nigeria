The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) has repaired and energised a 150MVA 330/132kV transformer in Kumbotso transmission substation in Kano state, five years after it was burnt. The spokesperson for the company, Ndidi Mbah on Thursday said it was the first time TCN in-house engineers successfully undertook such repair work, particularly for a badly burnt 150MVA capacity transformer. In a statement, she said the equipment had been put to service delivering more bulk electricity to Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDC). “It is also an indication of the growing capacity of its engineers under the present administration,” she noted. The substation had four units of 150MVA transformers but five years ago, one of them was burnt and considered irreparable. Another transformer tripped on January 1, 2019 and fixing it requires it would be transferred to a repair factory in Lagos.
