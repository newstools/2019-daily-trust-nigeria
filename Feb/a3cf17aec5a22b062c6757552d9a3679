An FCT High Court in Maitama has fixed March 18 for adoption of addresses in the no-case submission to be filed by the suspended Director-General of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Dr Mounir Gwarzo. Gwarzo was docked by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) on a five-count charge along with Zakawani Garba, a commissioner in SEC for allegedly paying himself severance benefits of N104.8m and N10.4m in excess of car grant while still in service. At the resumed hearing yesterday, the defendants, through their counsel, Abdulhakeem Mustapha (SAN) and Robert Emupkoeruo, informed the court of their intention to file no-case submission after the prosecution counsel, Adesina Raheem, had informed the court that the prosecution was closing its case against the defendants with the testimony of the fifth prosecution witness (PW5), Taiwo Olorunyomi. The defendants counsels said they were making the submissions pursuant to Section 302 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA), 2015. After listening to their submissions, the trial judge, Justice Husseini Baba-Yusuf adjourned until March 18 for adoption of addresses in the no-case submissions by the defendants.
