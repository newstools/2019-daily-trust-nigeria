The Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, on Wednesday led the Kwara state Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP) campaign to Ilorin South, promising to deliver more prosperity to the people of his constituency and the state in general. Also some youths numbering about 2,500 who were formerly PMB ambassadors decamped to the PDP saying they are tired of the Buhari-led federal government. Saraki, who was received by supporters across Ilorin South council, including, Fufu, the headquarters of the local government said he would consolidate on previous gains by delivering more dividend of democracy to the people of the state. He added: “With your mandate, I have facilitated considerable constituency and intervention projects to Kwara state. Once again, I have come to seek for your renewed mandate and support. “I will consolidate on previous gains and deliver more prosperity to our people.” He emphasised the need for Nigerians to vote en masse for the PDP’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, whom he said has the capacity to make Nigeria work again and eradicate poverty from the land. Also speaking, the PDP gubernatorial candidate in the state, Hon. Razak Atunwa, said if elected, his administration will focus attention on expanding opportunities for the youths through job creation and empowerment. Atunwa said his administration would create enabling environment for businesses and entrepreneurship to thrive. “Our demographic pattern demonstrates a dominant youth population, they must therefore be the central priority of our government,” Atunwa declared.
