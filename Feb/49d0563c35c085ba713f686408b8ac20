The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) says it has commissioned a 300MVA transformer at the 330/132/33kV Alaoji Transmission stations in Abia State. It has also delivered a 150MVA transformer for installation at the 330/132/33kV Kumbotso Transmission station in Kano. In a statement by the General Manager (Public Affairs), Mrs Ndidi Mbah, TCN said the 300MVA transformer was energized on February 12, 2019 at Alaoji which has increased the station’s capacity from 450MVA to 750MVA. It makes it the biggest substation in the South as the station is now consistent with the redundancy requirement of N-1 which implies having capacity to deliver bulk power always with multiple transformers. TCN said major towns in Abia North will see improved power supply which will extend to some parts of Imo and Ebonyi states under Enugu DisCo, and some towns in Rivers State under Port Harcourt DisCo. The company said it is executing key projects in the South-east to include four units of 132kV substations in Imo and Abia states.
