The Nigerian Insurers Association (NIA) has gotten approvals from the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to digitise marine insurance certificates, the NIA Chairman, Mr. Tope Smart, has said. Mr. Smart said the move is aimed at generating more income for the industry and contributing to the nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as well as keeping track on the policies. The NIA boss, in an interactive session with the media, also said the initiative will help the industry to recover all lost income prior to the approval and that the industry was also adopting technology to drive insurance businesses. He made a case against fake insurances and appealed for “more support as we strive to get rid of fake insurance certificates.” The NIA chairman also indicated that the association will, this year, collaborate with other industry bodies to grow the market and improve the industry. Smart expressed optimism that this year will be better and the industry will grow, whilst assuring that government will also renew group life policy. On the number of vehicles properly insured in the country, he said 2.5 million vehicles are actively captured on the Nigerian Insurance Industry Database (NIID), while the actual number of upload on the platform is over 3 million.
