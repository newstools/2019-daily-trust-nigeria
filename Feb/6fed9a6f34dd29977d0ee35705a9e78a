The wife of Atiku Abubakar, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Mrs. Titi Abubakar, has urged Benue women to kick out the All Progressives Congress (APC) government come February 16 election. Mrs Abubakar, who berthed her campaign train in Makurdi, Benue state on Monday stressed the need for women in the state to vote massively for her husband in the coming polls. She said the state under the APC government at the federal level has suffered untold hardship in nearly four years now, especially in terms of insecurity which had impacted negatively on mostly women and youths. Atiku’s wife noted that the APC government also failed in fulfilling its electioneering promises and therefore should be shown the way out of office for her husband to take over and get the country working again in the right direction. “The government of the day is very deceitful. All the promises they made, they never fulfilled any. There is hunger in the land,” she said. She added that the youths should not be deceived to sell their votes for N10,000, emphasising that her husband when voted to power would create millions of job for the teeming unemployed youths. Earlier, wife of the Benue State governor, Mrs Eunice Ortom, assured that the Benue women have resolved to overwhelmingly vote for Atiku Abubakar as president as well as all other PDP candidates.
