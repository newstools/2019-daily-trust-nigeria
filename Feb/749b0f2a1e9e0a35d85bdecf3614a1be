The Acting Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has urged Nigerians to look out for fake police or military officers on Election Day, saying fake security uniforms are being imported. The police chief stated this on Tuesday in Abuja at the presentation of partnership between Transition Monitoring Group, HEDA Resource Centre, Police Service Commission and ICPC on monitoring and prosecuting vote trading. “Every police or security officers you see on Election Day must carry tag for ease of identification so that we don’t have fake security personnel because we have heard that a lot of fake uniforms are being bought into the country,” Adamu said. He said the police have set up election monitoring investigation team to arrest and prosecute electoral offenders. He said the police will operate and observe human rights but warned that no Nigerian is allowed to do anything that contravenes electoral laws. The police chief reiterated that any police officers seen with politicians or any important personality on Election Day will be arrested. “On the election day, nobody will move with police personnel. I have told our personnel that if we see you moving with any VIPs, whether in uniform or mufti, you will be arrested,” the acting IGP said. He said the police have put a lot of security measures in place to secure the election process but sought for Nigerians’ support in implementing the strategies. He said every police officer, including himself, is involved in the election duty. Page 18 18 new Acting IGP Adamu vows to bridge missing link in police leadership
