Theresa May will return to Brussels on Wednesday to continue talks on her Brexit deal. She will meet the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker. Earlier, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay updated Cabinet on talks with the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. The meeting, on the issue of the Irish backstop, was described as “productive” but Mr Barnier “expressed concerns”. Jeremy Corbyn also announced he would be going to Brussels to meet Mr Barnier on Thursday. The Labour leader said they would discuss his party’s Brexit proposals – including a permanent customs union and a strong relationship with the single market – and that it was a “necessity” to take no deal off the table.
