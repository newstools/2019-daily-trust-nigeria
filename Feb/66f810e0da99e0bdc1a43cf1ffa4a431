Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has denied any involvement in the All Progressives Congress (APC) disrupted rally at his Gbajimgba home town in Guma local government area of the state. Ortom who reacted to the Friday incident through his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Tahav Agerzua, also reiterated his commitment to peaceful elections in the state as he called on all stakeholders to eschew violence and conduct that could trigger a breakdown of law and order. He urged his supporters in particular to exercise restraint even in the face of extreme provocation and to report any person or group who breaches the peace to law enforcement agents. The governor said that it became necessary to reiterate his position following accusations that he stopped the rally of an opposition party in Gbajimba. Ortom recalled that no one hindered the opposition from using the IBB Square in Makurdi nor disrupted their campaign flag off in Makurdi which is the state capital, stressing that attempts to link him with a failed campaign effort in his home local government area in order to smear his name was therefore baseless and unfounded. He therefore stated categorically that he did not instruct or direct any person to disrupt or stop any rally. The governor further condemned the destruction of his campaign materials in Gbajimba and Daudu in Guma as well as several other places including Wannune in Tarka and Lessel in Ushongo local government areas as he called on the police and other security agents to arrest and prosecute those found culpable. Ortom added that he does not have any antecedent of violence in his close to 40 years in politics and has never resorted to violence and the use of thugs to prosecute his campaigns or win elections.
