The trial of the suspended Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Samuel Onnoghen over non-declaration of assets will resume at the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) today in Abuja. The tribunal adjourned indefinitely last week following a ruling by the Court of Appeal directing the CCT to suspend trial pending the determination of an application for stay of proceedings filed by the embattled CJN. However, the appellate court in a unanimous decision on Wednesday declined to order a stay, citing the decision of the Supreme Court in Saraki vs the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2017. Following the Court of Appeal ruling, the CCT, set today for the resumption of hearing of the case. The decision to continue the trial followed a correspondent from the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB) asking for a new date to continue the trial following the decision of the appellate court. He added that hearing notices have since been appropriately communicated to all those concerned.
