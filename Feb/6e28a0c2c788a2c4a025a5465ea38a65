Oyo State Governor Abiola Ajimobi will not be in the Senate when the 9th National Assembly is inaugurated. This followed his defeat by Dr. Kola Balogun of the Peoples Democratic Party for the Oyo South Senatorial seat. Ajimobi, a senator from 2003 -2007, lost the election with less than 10,000 votes. Many said some of the controversies surrounding the governor’s action in the past may have conspired against him. One of the controversial actions of the governor was face-off between him and the Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Adetunji, over the review of the 1959 Olubadan chieftaincy declaration. The action was seen as an attempt to whittle the influence of the paramount ruler. They eventually reconciled. There was also the controversial encounter the governor had with students of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Ogbomoso, who staged a protest to his office on Wednesday. The governor was accused of disgracing the students, but he denied the allegation. Another controversial action by the governor was demolition of the Music House owned by Yinka Ayefele, a physically challenged, which was widely condemned. The governor however insisted that the demolition was carried out because Ayefele’s conduct contravenes the law of Oyo State. But the governor later rebuilt the Music House which hosts the musician’s FM Station.
