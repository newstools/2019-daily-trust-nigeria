As the country awaits the official announcement of results of yesterday‚Äôs Presidential and National Assembly elections by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Nigerians trooped to Twitter to express their varying opinions on the chances of their chosen presidential candidates. While some expressed optimism, few were pessimistic as a set of others were comical as seen in #BuhariIsWinning twitter trend below:  A woman left a toxic relationship only to find herself in another toxic relationship.

Irrespective of whoever is winning, As a Nigerian, its a sad day that in the year 2019, we are still unable to conduct a free, fair and credible polls.
