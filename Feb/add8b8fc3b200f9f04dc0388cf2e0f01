The FCT chapter of the National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) has been urged to shun thuggery and ballot box snatching during Saturday’s rescheduled presidential and National Assembly elections. President of NYCN, Comrade Suleiman Ango, who made the call at a press conference in Abuja, yesterday, also asked them not to allow politicians use them for their selfish gains. He said council has always appreciated efforts of the youth for their contributions towards nation building. He said NYCN expected that tomorrow’s election should be seen as a peaceful process through which leadership across the board would be democratically elected, hence the youth should exercise their franchise and stay away from any form of thuggery or disruption of the electoral process. Suleiman added that electoral violence was not part of the process, saying “we should desist from any act that can jeopardize the peaceful conduct of the exercise.” 2019: We are not available for thuggery - Youth council Kogi Commissioner cautions youths against thuggery, violence NYCN election: APC has no preferred candidate- Jalo
