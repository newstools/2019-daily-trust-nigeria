The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Ministry of Agriculture have announced an impending ban on tomato importation in two years’ time as Nigeria inches towards self-sufficiency in fertiliser production. CBN Governor Godwin Emefiele and Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Mr. Audu Ogbe made the commitment at the inspection and commissioning of Gino tomato paste factory and farm in Faka, Kaduna State. The CBN Governor said Dangote Farms and Gino have assured that if the CBN and the FG sustained tomato production, Nigeria should be self-sufficient in two years. Mr. Emefiele said as part of its support to boost local production of tomato, the CBN provided forex needed to procure machineries at the farm and also build the factory. “We should be grateful to God that we are in a position where we are witnessing this. Many more will happen. Like the minister said, whether we like it or not, as long as we’re producing this for our consumption and possibly for export, there’s no choice than to ban tomato importation,” he said. Mr. Emefiele also said beyond tomato, milk production would be the next target for local production and importation ban. In his comments,  Mr. Ogbe said the Federal Government will get more “aggressive and vigorously pursue the objective of diversifying the structure of the Nigerian economy.” Can FG’s ban on tomato paste import avert crisis?
