The International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague has said Ivory Coast’s former President Laurent Gbagbo is now in Belgium after his conditional release from prison. Gbagbo was acquitted by the court of war crimes charges on Friday, on the condition that he went to a country willing to send him back should there be an appeal. Prosecutors are expected to contest the verdict. Gbagbo had been charged with crimes against humanity over post-election violence in 2010 and 2011 in which 3,000 people were killed and 500,000 displaced. He was the first former head of state to go on trial at the ICC.
