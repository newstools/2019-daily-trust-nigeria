The Head of the In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) Centre at the National Hospital, Abuja, Dr. Rais Ibrahim, has enjoined civil servants to join cooperative societies in their work places in order to harness their many benefits. Dr. Ibrahim gave the advice yesterday in Abuja during the 11th Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the non-interest based El-Ansar Multipurpose Cooperative Society of the hospital. He said keying into cooperative societies had a lot of benefits for civil servants and their families such as savings, owning houses, cars, accessing interest-free loans, among others. Dr. Ibrahim, who is a member of El-Ansar, said the salary of most workers was not enough to take care of their families and responsibilities, adding that joining cooperatives enabled workers to plan, target projects for themselves and their families and also have useful funds whenever the need arose. The Chairman of El-Ansar at the National Hospital, Dr. Yidi Abdussalam, said the cooperative had recorded a lot of success since it was established, including giving birth to 14 other cooperatives within and outside Abuja. Dr. Abdussalam said the El-Ansar, though Islamic, had membership that comprised Muslim and non-Muslim staff of the National Hospital, as well as non-staff. He added that the society gave loans without charging interest based on Islamic injunction.
