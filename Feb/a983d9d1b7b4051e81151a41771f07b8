Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue state on Tuesday said he has fulfilled his promise to retire Senator George Akume from the National Assembly. Akume, an incumbent Senator representing Benue North West senatorial district and leader of APC in the state lost his fifth term bid to Emmanuel Orker Jev of PDP. The governor who had been at logger-head with Akume since defecting from the APC to join PDP in July last year, while reacting to Jev’s victory, posited that what happened at the polls was the will of God. Ortom added that he felt elated for fulfilling his promise to the Benue people. “Have I said anything and not done it? I work with God and He has always seen me through. Anyone who plays God, is bound to end in doom. God can’t share His glory with anyone. This is how it would be during the Governorship election. The tenure of a Governor is eight years and I will have my eight years. Just watch and see,” Ortom said.
