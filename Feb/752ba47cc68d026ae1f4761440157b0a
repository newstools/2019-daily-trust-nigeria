Five Solar Home Systems (SHS) companies have partnered with various communities in Nigeria on energy payment solutions. The firms are Azuri Technologies, A Solar, Oolu Solar, Smarter Grid International (SGI) and Sosai Renewable Energy Company, which have been integrated into the SWIFTA’s 20,000 cash collection agent network. Announcing the integration in Lagos, the Programme Manager, Nigeria Off-grid Market Acceleration Programme (NoMAP), Adedotun Eyinade, said it followed a rigorous User Acceptance Test (UAT) initiated and financed by NoMAP. He added that the initiative was designed to ease subscription collection from unbanked Pay As You Go (PAYGO) customers of the companies. Eyinade said, “The system is designed such that, a PAYGO customer from any of the five companies with a subscription plan can renew the subscription through SWIFTA’s mobile or static agents leveraging on the company’s proprietary OMNIBRANCH platform. “We understand that customers who are unbanked and living off the grid often face the arduous task of not being able to access PAYGO Solar since there are limited options to pay for their monthly subscriptions,” he noted. He said the five companies that partnered on the integration will expand into new off-grid communities and that the collection risk will be addressed by the integration.
