A wife of the PDP presidential candidate, Titi Atiku Abubakar, has urged women in Benue State to kick out the APC government on February 16, 2019. Mrs. Atiku, who berthed her campaign train in Makurdi, the state capital, yesterday, stressed the need for women in the state to vote massively for her husband. She said the state under the APC government at the federal level had suffered untold hardship for nearly four years, especially in terms of insecurity, which had impacted negatively on women and youths. Mrs. Atiku noted that the APC government also failed in fulfilling its electioneering promises and therefore should be shown the way out of office for her husband to take over and get the country working again in the right direction. “The government of the day is very deceitful. All the promises they made, they never fulfilled any. There is hunger in the land,” she said. She added that the youths should not be deceived to sell their votes for N10,000, emphasising that her husband, when voted to power, would create millions of jobs for the teeming unemployed youths. Earlier, wife of the Benue State Governor, Mrs. Eunice Ortom, assured Mrs. Atiku that Benue women had resolved to overwhelmingly vote for Atiku.
