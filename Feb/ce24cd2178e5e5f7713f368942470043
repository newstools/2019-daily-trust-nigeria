The Police in Benue State said its men averted what would have been a clash between supporters of the All Progressive Congress (APC) and that of the People Democratic Party (PDP) at Gbajimba in Guma Local Government Area of the state on Friday. State Commissioner of Police, Omololu Bishi in a statement released through his spokesman, explained that the issue started at about 1:00pm when PDP supporters protested that the APC were playing provocative music/songs at the Government Secondary School in Gbajimba venue of the APC campaign rally. “This resulted in hurling of stones and other objects and the destruction of campaign posters by supporters of both parties. No gunshot was fired by anyone and no casualty was recorded. “It, however, took the prompt intervention of the officers and men of the command led by the Area Commander of Makurdi Area Command to disperse the crowd which was almost becoming riotous,” Bishi stated. The commissioner however, expressed disappointment that such incidence would happen at this time despite the peace pact signed by the various political party aspirants. He vowed to bring those behind the incident to book and appealed to the residents to remain law abiding and eschew violence in their day to day activities.
