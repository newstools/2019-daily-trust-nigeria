The FCT minister, Malam Muhammad Bello, has assured residents that security measures have been put in place to have peaceful polls in the territory. Bello gave the assurance during the FCT security committee meeting in Abuja, yesterday, which reviewed the security situation ahead of the 2019 polls. The minister said security measures have been mapped out to ensure that elections in the FCT were peaceful as always, noting that the FCT had always recorded peaceful elections and that he intends to keep it that way. “As you know this is not the first election being held in the FCT. The territory has a history of holding very peaceful elections and we don’t expect this one to be any different. We expect this one to be very peaceful and we encourage all registered voters within the FCT to come out en masse to cast their votes,” he said He commended security agencies, traditional rulers, religious leaders and indeed all residents of the FCT for their commitment to peaceful elections as demonstrated so far in the conduct of their affairs, expressing the hope that at the end of it all, there would be cause for celebrations. 1.02m FCT residents to vote area council officials Play roles to enhance peaceful polls, FCT minister tells civil servants Page 6 Friday
