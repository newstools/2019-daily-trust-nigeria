Two senatorial candidates of the  African Democratic Party (ADC ) in Kogi State; Dr Victor Alewo Adoji (for Kogi East) and Adeyemi Olabode John (Kogi West) have accused the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC)-led administration of Governor Yahaya Bello of hampering the electoral process. Addressing journalists in Abuja, Dr Adoji alleged that the State government and its agents were sponsoring violent attacks on him and his supporters. But in a swift reaction through his Director General (DG), Media and Strategy, Kingsley Fanwo, Governor Bello  dismissed the allegations as propaganda. Dr Adoji dragged the governor and the APC before the international community asking them to promptly redress the overbearing attitudes of the state government towards opposition parties in the state. He said the violence had only spelt anarchy but also violated his political rights having fulfilled the necessary requirements to contest for elective positions in Nigeria. He said the determination to endear his candidacy to the electorate via peaceful and other legitimate electioneering endeavours had been hampered by thugs allegedly sponsored by the state government and its agents.
