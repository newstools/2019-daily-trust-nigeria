The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has begun the deployment of both sensitive and non-sensitive electoral materials in the states. The National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee of INEC, Festus Okoye disclosed yesterday in Abuja at an interactive session with newsmen covering the commission. “As at today (Wednesday), the various zonal stores of INEC have taken possession of the non-sensitive materials. Some have been delivered to the states and even local government offices. Some of these non-sensitive electoral materials include ballot boxes, voting cubicles, writing materials, and others. “The generating sets that will be used in the various registration areas have also been delivered to them. On the basis of that, we have asked the Resident Electoral Commissioners RECs to beef up security in the various local government offices because some of these offices have started receiving the non-sensitive materials for the conduct of the elections. “Secondly, the central banks in the various states have started receiving the sensitive materials for the various states. These sensitive materials include ballot papers and result sheets. The elections are just a few days away and if the states have not started receiving these materials then it means we are not a serious commission,” he said. On the PVCs that were burnt in Abia State, Okoye said Nigerians should express outrage at that because the commission believed that the nation should have passed that phase of burning offices.
