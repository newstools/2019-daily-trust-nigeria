The Foundation for Good Governance in Nigeria (FGGN) has endorsed the candidature of President Muhammadu Buhari ahead of the coming presidential election. The Secretary General of the UK-based Non-Governmental Organisation for the promotion of good governance, democracy, and development in Nigeria, Dr Falalu Dahiru Danwata, in a release yesterday urged all well-meaning Nigerians to vote for President Buhari. “Since its inception in 2002, the FGGN has consistently thrown its weight behind the candidature of General Muhammadu Buhari (GMB) in the four election cycles of 2003, 2007, 2011, and 2015. “Such unwavering support was predicated on the belief that GMB was the best that Nigeria and Nigerians needed and deserved to lead them out of the quagmire facing the country, as compared with other candidates in those election cycles. “Now that we are in yet another election cycle and that all political parties have nominated their candidates for the presidential election, we are duty bound to look again for the best presidential candidate. On doing that, we found President Buhari to be the best candidate. “In essence, none of the 72 candidates for the 2019 presidential election can match President Buhari in terms of integrity, honesty, trustworthiness, and records of achievements,” the statement said.
