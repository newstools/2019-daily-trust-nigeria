Southeast chapter of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has said that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) only saved the day of President Muhammadu Buhari’s defeat. In a statement signed by the Publicity Secretary, Chijioke Ekwegh, the party said that the ruling APC was seeing defeat because the country was united in making sure that Buhari was voted out. The party accused the electoral body of working to ensure that Buhari is re-elected. PDP said that the last minute postponement of the polls was an indication that the APC-led federal government had failed woefully. PDP said that the electorate would vote out Buhari because hunger, killings, nepotism and unemployment had increased since the president came on board in 2015. The statement said: “That the last minute postponement of the presidential and National Assembly polls by INEC is an indication that the APC-led federal government has failed woefully.” “That the last gasp postponement is an indication that the electoral umpire is under pressure and doing the bidding of the APC just to rig the elections in the favour of the unpopular president Muhammadu Buhari.” “From East to West and even in the North, PDP and our articulate presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, is popular and very much accepted,” the statement added.
