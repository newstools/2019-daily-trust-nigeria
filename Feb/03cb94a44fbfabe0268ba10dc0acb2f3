The All Progressives Congress (APC)’s Presidential Campaign Council has denied claims that President Muhammadu Buhari called for violence in Zamfara State. Festus Keyamo, Director of Strategic Communications, APC Presidential Campaign Council made this denial in a statement on Tuesday. “The candidate of the main opposition himself…threw caution to the wind in Port-Harcourt, Rivers State on Monday, February 11, 2019, when he alleged that President Muhammadu Buhari called for violence when he campaigned in Zamfara State. “Nothing can be farther from the truth. The Hausa word the President used in Zamfara, which has been taken out of context, is “fitna”. Incidentally, all our Hausa language scholars have said the word means different things: it means distress, trial, affliction or temptation. It can also be used to describe rebellion or uprising. “In this case, President Buhari was actually weighing in on the joke told very often of recent in the North that due to the rice boom, farmers have embarked on pilgrimage and the marrying of more wives. “So, what the President meant was actually a joke deliberately taken out of context: he simply told the crowd to ensure they eat very well because of the rice boom before they can contemplate giving in to those temptations.” He urge Atiku not to set the country ablaze by outright falsehood.
