A former Senate President, Ameh Ebute, has raised the alarm over the alleged alliance between ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo and leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Ebute said the unholy union between Obasanjo and leadership of the PDP will fail, adding that it cannot destroy the gains recorded by the President Mohammadu Buhari-led federal government in the last few years. Ebute, who is also the leader of the Congress for Patriotic Citizens (CPC), at a press conference in Abuja today, called on Nigerians to rise to the challenge of confronting and subduing unpatriotic, corrupt and selfish past political office holders in order to save Nigeria from total collapse. He said: “Other leaders of Nigeria since independence are not this privileged or so blessed. So, if today any one of us finds reason to complain that we are yet to nurture a nation we truly desire and to the maturity our founding fathers dreamt, a leader who should take the double blame is Chief Obasanjo. Why? Because leadership fell on him at Nigeria’s most auspicious moments. But we saw nothing he did wonderfully.” He said the CPC finds it completely distasteful, the present gang-up and conspiracy against Nigeria by the PDP and the former president. “We cannot understand Obasanjo anymore. We do not know what he implies when he accuses INEC of ‘recruiting collation officers who are already awarding results based on their projects to actualise the perpetuation agenda in which the people will not matter and the votes will not count.’ As former President of Nigeria, isn’t this statement too fluid? Even if Chief Obasanjo hates Buhari, hatchet jobs like this one, as contained in his recent letter, should be left for his boys.” Why APC,  PDP leaders are running to Obasanjo How Jonathan and Obasanjo fell apart APC merger won’t work - Ebute
