The governorship candidate of the National Rescue Movement (NRM) in Katsina State, Alhaji Sagir Abubakar Halilu Jikamshi, has said he wants to win the governorship election in order to provide the needed development. Alhaji Jikamshi who said this in Abuja while fielding questions from journalists, regretted that both the PDP and the APC administrations could not influence the completion of a windmill power generation project introduced by the late President Umaru Yar’adua government. On the issue of his deputy aligning with the APC, Alhaji Jikamshi said, “Maybe he can stay with us and do some damage, but we put it in prayers. If he repents, we can still work together. Even the APC knows that they are perpetrating illegality. Our government should be seen to be honest by giving equal chances. They want to distract attention. But it will not distract my attention,” he added.  Jikamshi joins Katsina gov’ship race under Rescue party Don’t disgrace me at home - Buhari Page 19
