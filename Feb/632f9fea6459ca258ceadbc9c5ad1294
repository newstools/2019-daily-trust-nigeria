Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue state on Thursday said his government and residents of the state are ready to give the presidential candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar a rousing reception as his campaign train berths tomorrow (Friday) in the state. In a statement signed his Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, the governor said that Benue people will come out in their numbers to welcome Atiku as a sign of the love and confidence they have in him. Ortom described the PDP presidential candidate as the right man to restore unity among Nigerians and give them a sense of belonging as citizens of the same country. He also expressed confidence in Atikuâ€™s capability to provide the quality of leadership that the people need at a time the country is passing through difficulties. He noted that majority of Benue people have resolved to cast their votes for Atiku on February 16, 2019 in anticipation that his administration will be able to end wanton killing of innocent people in parts of the state by armed bandits. The governor added that a government headed by Atiku will drive economic policies that would offer youths of the country rewarding job opportunities so as to make them more useful to themselves and their communities. #PDPPresidentialPrimaries: Ortom, Dankwambo, Saraki hail Atiku win, pledge support for 2019 Benue walks tightrope Ortom, Turaki submit nomination forms to PDP
