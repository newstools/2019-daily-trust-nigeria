Mr Ja’afaru Ahmed, Controller-General of the Nigeria Prisons Service (NPS) has disclosed that the Service paid the sum of N563, 858, 670 as claims to personnel last year. Ahmed disclosed this at the 13th Annual Prisons Welfare Insurance Scheme (PWIS) workshop on Wednesday in Abuja. He said: “The Scheme, in its continuous determination to assist staff has, within the last 12 months (January – December, 2018) paid 179 Beneficiaries death claims to the tune of N153,083,080, 146 Beneficiaries medical claims to the tune of N26, 168, 008 for officers who, in the streak of duty, sustained injury and totally paid 1007 Beneficiaries retirement claims to the tune of N384, 342, 582 amounting to a total of 1332 beneficiaries. “Thus, aggregate sum of N563, 858, 670 has been released for payment and paid to beneficiaries.” Ahmed reiterated the commitment of the Service to the welfare of staff through skills acquisition to enhance their financial status, even after retirement. He said poor planning and management of retirement had proven to be a cause of financial challenges for many workers in Nigeria and the NPS. “This year’s workshop skill acquisition theme, ‘Building your tomorrow today’ is designed to address the financial instability that sometimes accompanies retirement from service and also add value to life in retirement,” Ahmed said.
