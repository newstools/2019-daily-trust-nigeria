The Plateau State Governor, Simon Bako Lalong has said he would concede defeat if he loses the gubernatorial elections scheduled for March 2nd and therefore, stressed that no one should resort to violence on his behalf. Lalong, who stated this on Thursday while commissioning the Forgiveness and Peace Garden in Jos, urged his political opponents to ensure they do the same, adding that this would ensure a violence free polls. “Today we are going into an election and people are already predicting that there would be violence, violence for what? I am a candidate and I don’t want anybody to shed his blood for me. “If I lose the election, I will accept it but I also expect that anybody who would lose the election should accept defeat and that way, there would be no violence,” he said. He expressed dismay that some politicians encouraged youths to go into violence when they lose elections and warned youth that, “you will kill yourselves for nothing and the candidates will be there after with their children enjoying. “Nobody would even announce or recognise that you are one of those who died. That is why I always say that when politicians ask you to go and fight, tell them to bring their children,” The governor assured that the government would provide a conducive atmosphere for free and fair election while also putting the necessary machineries for those who would make trouble.
