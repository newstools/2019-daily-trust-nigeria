The police yesterday arraigned four men in a Wuse Zone 6 magistrates’ court, Abuja, over threat to kidnap a resident of Jikwoyi, an Abuja suburb. The defendants, Nasiru Abdulmuminu, 25; Bello Sani, 33; Muhammed Tukur, 20, and Tanko Abubakar, 20, are of no fixed addresses and are standing trial on a three-count charge of criminal conspiracy, intimidation and attempted extortion. Prosecuting counsel, Mr G. J Ayanna, said the complainant, Mr Yusuf Eseyin, of Jikwoyi Abuja, reported the matter at the Police IGP-Intelligence Response Team Abuja. He alleged that the defendants had called the complainant with a private number and threatened to kidnap and kill him if he failed to give them N6 million. Ayanna told the court that police detectives, however, tracked the number and arrested the defendants. The prosecutor said the offences contravened the provisions of sections 97, 397 and 95 of the Penal Code. While two of the defendants, Abdulmuminu and Sani admitted their guilt of the charges, Tukur and Abubakar, denied committing the offences. The magistrate, Mr Aminu Eri, summarily sentenced Abdulmuminu and Sani to three months imprisonment each and granted Tukur and Abubakar bail in the sum of N200,000 each. Eri however, gave the convicts an option of paying a fine of N30,000 each. The magistrate ordered Tukur and Abubakar to produce two sureties each who must reside within the court’s jurisdiction and adjourned the case until Feb. 25, for hearing.
