Leading trustee and fund manager, UTL Trustees, has launched an online will writing service called WillPower, to simplify the process of writing a will for the average Nigerian. UTL Trustees, licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has in its over 50-year history focused on creating, protecting and managing assets. With WillPower, Nigerians can create their wills from the comfort of their homes and so, determine how their assets will be transferred to loved ones. The Managing Director of UTL Trustees, Mrs. Olufunke Aiyepola, said, “The process of creating a will has now been made easy. All an individual needs to do is to create a secure account on our website, draft a will, print and sign. “Once it’s dropped off at our designated couriers around the country, a legal team will review it and the will would be lodged at probate in any of the 36 states chosen by the individual. The process is seamless and the questions are easy to answer. All wills generated on WillPower are legally valid.” Stanbic IBTC Trustees educating people to have a will, estate plan – Max-Gbinije ‘Trustees can put a stop to estate disputes’ Debts are at risk without corporate  trustees - STL Trustees CEO
