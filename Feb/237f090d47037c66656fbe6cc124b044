The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has endorsed President Muhammadu Buhari as its candidate ahead of Saturday’s presidential election. ACF is Northern Nigeria’s foremost socio-cultural group with membership across the 19 northern states and the Federal Capital Territory, FCT. Acting chairman of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the forum, Alhaji Musa Usman Kwande, who spoke on behalf of the forum at a news conference in Kaduna, said the forum while aware that prominent northerners were in the race for the presidency, had to look at their track records and achievements before taking the decision to support Buhari. He said the ACF was of the view that certain attributes such as clarity of thought, unity of purpose, content of character and morality of candidates; leadership qualities, performance and general acceptability should guide voters in making their choices. The forum said its decision on who to elect was not based on any form of inducement, mob hysteria, intimidation or false promises.
