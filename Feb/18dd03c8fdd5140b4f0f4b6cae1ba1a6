The Imo State Police Command says it observes  an indiscriminate use of vehicles with covered number plates, unauthorized tinted glasses, revolving lights/siren, police spy plate numbers and government plate numbers on private vehicles. The command said that it would not spare anyone caught violating the law prohibiting their use. The command, in a statement yesterday by its Police Public Relations Officer, SP Orlando Ikeokwu, expressed concern at  the serious security challenges the action  posed to the efforts of the police in combating crime and criminality in the state, especially during the period of electioneering. The police therefore warned owners of such unauthorized vehicles to remove such insignia from their vehicles within one week. Ebonyi: Police impound vehicles over number plates, tinted glass, siren.
