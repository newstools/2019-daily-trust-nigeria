Unconfirmed report says two persons were injured on Thursday during  an alleged attack on the convoy  of Vice President Yemi  Osinbajo  in Ilorin,  Kwara state. Although details of the incident were yet to be ascertained officially, security sources confirmed the incident occurred around Isale Aluko  area of the metropolis where Osinbajo had gone on his door-to-door campaign in the state capital. A police source who craved anonymity explained that the incident actually occurred after the Vice President’s convoy had left the vicinity. Meanwhile, the two major political parties in the state, the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples  Democratic Party (PDP) today blamed each other for the attack. While the APC claimed the attack on Osinbajo  was masterminded by PDP elements, the latter insisted that the attack  stemmed from disagreement  on how to share money allegedly given to political thugs  working  for the APC. When contacted, the spokesperson for the state’s police command, Ajayi  Okasanmi, said he was yet to be briefed about the incident adding that he would make an official  statement once he clarified the issue.
