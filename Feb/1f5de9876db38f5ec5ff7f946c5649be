The police have arraigned in court a native doctor, Ojo Sunday, for allegedly defrauding a man, Ibrahim Mohammed, of N60,000 on the pretext of doubling the money for him. Ojo Sunday, a resident of Dantata in Dei-dei, Abuja, was arraigned in a Kubwa Grade 1 Area Court, Abuja, on a one-count charge of cheating. The Prosecutor, Babajide Olanipekun, told the court that Mohammed reported the matter at the Kubwa Police Station on January 22, 2016. Olanipekun said the defendant, sometime in December 2018, deceived the complainant and collected N60,000 from him, promising to double the money. He said Sunday converted the money to his personal use, adding that the offence contravened Section 322 of the Penal Code. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The Judge, Ibrahim Balarabe, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N100, 000 with one reliable surety who must be resident within the court’s jurisdiction. He adjourned the matter to March 6, 2019, for hearing.
