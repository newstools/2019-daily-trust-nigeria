Former governor of Ogun State, Otunba Gbenga Daniel, yesterday, blamed the inability of the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, to conduct open rally in the state on inadequate timing. Daniel, who is the Deputy Chairman of PDP Presidential Campaign Council (South), led Atiku’s campaign train to Ogun central and west senatorial districts, ahead of the election. Atiku did not hold a rally in the state, but his wife, Mrs Titi Abubakar, had visited the state to campaign for her husband. Daniel, in an interview with newsmen, yesterday, on the sidelines of the tour, said “Ogun is already a done deal for Atiku.” He said, “He (Atiku) has been to Ogun State on a number of occasions. It’s just a question of strategy. Sometimes you go and do big rallies. But don’t forget rallies that are done like that are meant to collect the converted. And you know, our Ogun State is a very sophisticated environment. I think we have done what we need to do,” he said.
