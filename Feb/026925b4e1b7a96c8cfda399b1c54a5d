Ahead of the 2019 governorship election, the people of Orlu zone have said that they are contemplating adopting a consensus candidate. Uche Nwosu of the Action Alliance (AA) and Hope Uzodinma of the All Progressives Congress (APC) are the two candidates from the zone slugging it out in the election. The people, under the aegis of Orlu Gong, said “irrespective of the fact that an indigene of the zone has been on the saddle as the governor, the area has nothing to show for it”. In a statement signed by the chairman of the Board of Administrators, Fidel Anujuo and Director of Research and Documentation,  Mazi Uche Ohia, the zone expressed regret that despite the fact that Governor Rochas Okorocha is from Orlu,  he “deliberately left the zone undeveloped, concentrating rather on only Owerri zone”. The statement said,  “whatever decision we take now will not only affect us, our families, our beloved zone and the progress of our state at least for the next four years or even eight years but will probably affect us for the rest of our lives” The group added that in adopting a consensus candidate, the choice might not necessarily cone from Orlu, but could be any candidate that identifies with the wishes and aspirations of the people. “We have identified and shortlisted about six serious, credible and capable governorship candidates (two from each geopolitical zone)for consideration after which we shall notify our people of the recommended or preferred candidate. “Only a candidate that has a well-articulated plan for addressing the focal challenges of Orlu zone, particularly infrastructure, human capital development, ecology, agriculture, sports, tourism, commerce, industry, etc, will be considered for our votes in the coming election”.
