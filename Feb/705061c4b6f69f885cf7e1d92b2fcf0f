The Kano State gubernatorial candidate of the Green Party of Nigeria (GPN), Abdulsalam Abdulkarim Zaura, yesterday, vowed to end the lingering problem of Almajiri, a system which allows children to fend for themselves through begging. Speaking to newsmen in Kano, Zaura said he had developed a 26-point agenda for Kano State as part of GPN’s strategy ahead of the general elections. “In our 26-point agenda, we have adopted a system that will take away these innocent children off the streets through creation of a system that will treat the Almajiri schools like primary schools, among other measures,” he said. Zaura who is the youngest gubernatorial candidate in the state, added that under the 26-point agenda, his government would generate 200mw of electricity within the first two years of his government, saying he would increase it to 400mw in four years.
