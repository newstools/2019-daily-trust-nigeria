Hoodlums have set ablaze the office of the Independent Electoral Commission, INEC in Isialangwa South local government area of Abia State. The hoodlums were said to have stormed the INEC office and set it on fire around 2am today. The attack was said to have woken the youths of the area from their sleep, as they quickly mobilized and also alerted the police who assisted them in putting off the fire. Even though the fire did maximum damage to the structure and materials kept there, the quick intervention of the youths and the assistance of the police saved the situation from becoming hopeless. Daily Trust gathered that INEC had continued to operate from the old office until a few weeks ago when it eventually decided to relocate from the local government headquarters. This is the second time that INEC office in Isiala Ngwa is being burnt down. In 2015, in the heat of the controversy surrounding the governorship election in Abia State, thugs were alleged to have set the INEC office at Omopa on fire, prompting the relocation to Umu-Ikaa.
