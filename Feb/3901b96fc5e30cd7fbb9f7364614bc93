The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Kano, says it has removed the name of Sha’aban Sharada as the APC House of Representatives candidate for the Kano Municipal Federal Constituency, following a Federal High Court order. The Public Relations Officer of the commission, Alhaji Lawal Garba, disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Kano on Monday. According to him, the commission was still awaiting the name of the All Progressives Congress (APC) House of Representatives candidate for the Kano Municipal Constituency. “We are working on the order of the court in removing the name, but the APC leadership in the state is yet to present another name to replace that of Sharada,” he said. According to him, the name of Sharada, a Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Broadcast Media was earlier submitted to the Commission by the party as its candidate. NAN recalls that APC had earlier presented the name of Sharada as the winner of the Primary election for the constituency but his opponent, Alhaji Mukhtari Ishak-Yakasai challenged the election and sought redress in Court.
