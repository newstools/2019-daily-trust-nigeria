The federal government yesterday suggested breakthrough in negotiations with the striking university lecturers. The lectures under the umbrella of Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) started an indefinite strike on November 5, 2018, after the failure to reach agreement with the government over their demands. The strike has disrupted activities in universities across the country. While both sides have continued to hold talks, nothing much has come out of them. But the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, at a media conference in Abuja, yesterday said an agreement was reached with the union which was expected to call off the strike today. He said, “the strike will be called off from today (yesterday) or tomorrow (today) and certainly, there won’t be strike next week.” Education ministers hints breakthrough in ASUU talks We’ve not fulfilled our bargain with ASUU – FG FG admits it''s betrayed ASUU on years of deals - Ed minister
