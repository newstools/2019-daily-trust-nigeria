As many people trooped out to vote in Rivers state, the exercise is yet to commence at Unit 5 polling centre in Diamond Hill where the presidential candidate of Social Democratic Party (SDP), Donald Duke is waiting to cast his vote. The national vice chairman of the All Progressive Congress (APC) Hilliard Eta is also waiting to vote at the unit. The INEC officials in charge of result sheets were yet to arrive as at 10am. The key officials arrived much earlier and returned to their houses pending when INEC officials would be ready. Meanwhile, there was reported buying and selling of PVCs behind the polling unit. But when journalists were invited, they took to their heels. #NigeriaDecides2019: Voting commences in Jigawa LIVE: FCT goes to the polls Accreditation, voting commence in Ondo poll
