Sen. Abu Ibrahim (APC, Katsina), has said that they will make sure Senate President Bukola Saraki did not return to the Senate, adding that President Muhammadu Buhari’s second term will consolidate the gains of the first term. Sen. Ibrahim who stated this at the weekend during a visit to the Daily Trust office in Abuja, said President Buhari would have smooth relationship with the National Assembly during his second term for the of Nigerians. A ranking member, Sen. Ibrahim who did not vie for re-election during the last APC primaries, said once the new National Assembly is inaugurated, it will entirely be a new ball game. “Once the new one comes in, it will have nothing to do with the other one…Maybe 30 or 40 per cent (of senators) would come back, so there would be new leadership; Saraki will not be the president,” he said. Asked why he said Saraki will not be the presiding officer, Sen. Ibrahim said, “I’m sure of that; I’m definitely sure he will not come back as Senate president. If he’s lucky, he gets his seat because we would work against him until he losses. “Quote me, we would do everything possible to see that he losses his seat…It is not even the issue of becoming the Senate president. It’s a challenge I’m giving him,” he added. Sen. Ibrahim said going by the mammoth crowd Buhari was attracting during his campaigns across the country, he was optimistic the president would get a second term. He said Buhari would also remain fearless in his anti-corruption drive in addition to maintaining the momentum of reviving the economy and addressing security challenges.
