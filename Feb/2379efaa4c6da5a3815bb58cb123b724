The final results of last Saturdayâ€™s Presidential and National Assembly elections in Zamfara says President Muhammadu Buhari of All Progressives Congress (APC) has defeated his closest opponent of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, with 313,259 votes. This was announced by the Returning Officer of the poll, Prof. Kabiru Bala, at the end of the collation of results on Tuesday in Gusau. Bala said while Buhari polled 438,682 votes, Atiku scored 125,423 votes. He however reported that many of the local government returning officers complained of attacks by either bandits or hoodlums leading to the rejection of a total of 18,785 votes across the 14 local government areas of the state. The returning officer thereafter called on all the political party representatives present to endorse the results, after which he proceeded to Abuja for submission at the national collation centre.
