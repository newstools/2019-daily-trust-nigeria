Justice Mojisola Mojisola Olatoregun of the Federal High Court in Lagos yesterday threatened to jail a former Minister of State for Defence, Musiliu Obanikoro, for being absent in court. The absence of Obanikoro, who is testifying for the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission in the trial of a former Ekiti State Governor Ayo Fayose, stalled the continuation of his cross-examination. EFCC lawyer Rotimi Jacobs (SAN) said Obanikoro took ill and was admitted. “I called him yesterday (Wednesday) to notify him about today’s (yesterday’s) proceedings. He said he thought he would be discharged on Wednesday (when the court did not sit). “This morning (Thursday) I couldn’t reach him on phone. But his Special Assistant came and informed me that Obanikoro was in the hospital receiving treatment,” he said. When the judge asked for a medical report, Jacobs submitted one given him by Obanikoro’s aide. But the judge the judge said: “If I want to pursue it, the medical doctor may lose his license for issuing this report. But I will accept this because you (Jacobs) are a responsible member of the inner bar. “If he fails to appear, he’ll be sent to jail and they’ll be bringing him from there with Black Maria”. The case was adjourned to February 18. Armsgate: Judge threatens to order Obanikoro's arrest Obanikoro: How I delivered $5m cash to Fayose Armsgate: Judge chides former Defence Minister, Obanikoro
