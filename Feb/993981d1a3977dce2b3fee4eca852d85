The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC has said that there was no basis for the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP to reject the results of last Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections across the country. The collated results are being formally submitted at the National collation centre located at the International Conference Centre (ICC), Abuja. The Chief Press Secretary to the Chairman of INEC, Mr. Rotimi Oyekanmi, told Daily Trust last night that the commission was doing the right thing and would not want to join issues with anyone or party. “The results being announced are not full of errors, they are valid. We have not conclude the release of the results. We have just released 10 and we still have results of other states to declare. “So, we will continue with what we are doing successfully and as expected of us. What we are doing is the right thing to be done,” Oyekanmi said. PDP had, earlier in the evening, called for the cancellation of results of the elections, saying the polls were marred by malpractices.
