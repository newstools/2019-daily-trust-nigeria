Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, yesterday, said he has fulfilled his promise to retire Senator George Akume from the National Assembly. Akume, a serving senator representing Benue North West and leader of APC in the state, lost his fifth term bid to Emmanuel Orker Jev of PDP. The governor, who has been at loggerheads with Akume since defecting from the APC to join PDP in July, last year, while reacting to Jev’s victory, posited that what happened at the polls was the will of God. Ortom added that he felt elated for fulfilling his promise to the Benue people.
