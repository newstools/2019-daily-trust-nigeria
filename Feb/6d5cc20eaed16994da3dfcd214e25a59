President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday urged federal permanent secretaries to eschew partisanship in their decisions and actions for the proper implementation of government programmes and policies. Speaking during the swearing-in of eight newly appointed federal permanent secretaries at the council chamber of the presidential villa, he said they must remain above board. “You must all remain above board and eschew partisanship your decisions and actions. You must strive to achieve excellence at all times. Your motto should be civility and serviceability,” he said. The newly inaugurated permanent secretaries are Dr. Bakari Wadinga (Adamawa), Dr. Mohammed Dikwa (Borno), Dr. (Mrs) Ajani Magdalene N. Olor (Delta), and Umakhihe Ernest Afolabi (Edo). Others are Mbaeri Maurice Nnamdi (Imo), Babatunde Lawal (Lagos), Mr. Festus Yusuf Narai Daudu (Nasarawa), and Abel Olumuyiwa Enitan (Osun). “As politicians, we develop policies and provide strategic direction for the nation. However, the task of implementing these policies and strategies rests in the hands of the civil service under the able guidance of the permanent secretaries. “Over the decades, I am sure you have experienced how successive governments have abused, undermined and destroyed the systems of checks and balances within the civil service that were meant to protect and preserve the interest of our citizens. “This systemic abuse of power significantly enriched a few privileged individuals while at the same time making the majority of our fellow citizens poorer and underserved,” he said.
