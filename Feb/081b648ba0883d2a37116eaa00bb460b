Presidential candidate of PDP Atiku Abubakar has said he will oversee his government if he wins and will not allow a cabal to run it. Atiku, who stated this while interacting with stakeholders from the 23 local government areas of Kaduna State, at the Trade Fair complex, said President Muhammadu Buhari was not fully in control of government, alleging that was what led to the current pains and suffering in the country. Atiku said PDP would not tolerate any form of ballot snatching and would not indulge in any act against the Electoral Law, adding that the order to kill any ballot box snatcher was undemocratic. The former vice president said if elected in next Saturday’s election, he would sell off the NNPC to provide more development, saying for now,  only very few were benefiting from the operations of the national assets at the expense of the entire Nigerians. To this end, he challenged President Buhari who is equally the Minister of Petroleum to relinquish the running of the NNPC to ordinary people to show his level of sincerity. “If I get elected as president, 40 per cent of my cabinet will be youth and education will be provided for all regardless of any affiliation, and my government will not be run by cabals,” he said. I will not allow cabal to run my government – Atiku No cabal can hijack Atiku – ex-Kogi governor My government won’t accommodate cabal - Atiku
