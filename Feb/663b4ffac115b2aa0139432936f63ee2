Less than 12 hours to the Saturday’s Presidential/NASS election, residents of Port Harcourt and its suburbs are lamenting the hike in transportation fare across Rivers state. The hike in transportation fare, our reporter learnt, is not unconnected to the influx of residents to various motor parks in the city who are on last minute move to travel to their respective villages, wards and units to cast their votes. A visit by our reporter to Mile 1, Mile 3, Abali and Rumuokoro parks showed an influx of passengers to the motor parks. Some of the passengers that spoke with our reporter said that there was 20% hike in transportation fare from Port Harcourt to Ahoada as well as from Port Harcourt to Omoku. A passenger who simply identified himself as James said that a journey from Port Harcourt to Ahoada which cost N400 before now goes for N600. He said that a journey to Omoku that cost N500 is now N600. “The transporters are taking the advantage to hike the transport fare. Before now it cost N400 to get to Ahoada but they have hiked the fare to N600″ “A journey to Omoku which cost N500 is now N600. The hike is as a result of high influx of passengers to the parks.  There is an influx of people and the vehicles on ground are not enough to take all the passengers,” he said. A driver of a popular transport company in Port Harcourt who pleaded anonymity also confirmed that the hike in transportation fare was as a result of influx of passengers. He said the number of passengers at the parks outnumbered the vehicles available. He said the transport fare will normalize as soon as the Presidential election is over.
