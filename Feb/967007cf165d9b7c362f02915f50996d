The FCT chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has accused the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) of plans to allegedly rig tomorrow’s (Saturday), rescheduled presidential and National Assembly elections in the territory. Speaking at a press briefing at the party’s secretariat in Abuja, yesterday, the FCT publicity secretary of the PDP, Miss Josephine Itoryah Splendor, said intelligence report reaching the party’s secretariat clearly showed that the FCT APC had already earmarked polling units across the six area councils to rig elections. She also alleged that the ruling APC had perfected plans to hire thugs from neighbouring Nasarawa State on the eve of the election to invade some polling units to rig the elections in their favour. She explained that the plot has prompted PDP to raise alarm to draw the attention of security agencies that will man such polling units. “It is on this note that our party’s senatorial candidate, Senator Philip Aduda and all other PDP candidates in the FCT have consistently maintained in their campaigns that their ambition is not worth the blood of anybody,” she said. She therefore called on the youth to shun acts of violence in the bid to sabotage the choice of the masses during tomorrow’s election. Reacting, the publicity secretary of the APC in FCT, Adaji Usman, said the allegations were baseless, alleging that it is the PDP that is known for rigging elections. “Our party, APC, has campaigned vigorously across the entire FCT and we have the majority and supporters that are ready to vote for us on election day, so it is funny that PDP who are known for rigging are now crying that APC was planning to rig elections,” he said. He said the ruling APC was fully on ground in the territory, boasting that the party shall emerge victorious through free, fair and credible election on Saturday.
