A US-based lawyer and former President of Egbe Omo Yoruba, North America, Dr. Olu McGinnis Otubusin, has called on the Yoruba nation not to vote any other candidate except that of Buhari-Osinbajo. He warned that a win for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) means that Yoruba nation will have to wait another 24 years to produce a President. In a statement made available to Daily Trust in Lagos, Otubusin noted that the Saturday February 23 rescheduled Presidential election is very “crucial for every Yoruba son and daughter”. Otubosun who is also the Convener, Yoruba Omoluabi Caucus, said Yoruba must consider that Prof. Yemi Osinbajo has even represented the race very well as a Vice President. “Our objective as an organization is to work for a constitutional arrangement and political restructuring in which the Yoruba nation can move ahead along with other nationalities in Nigeria, has an unfettered autonomy that will advance the development of Yoruba civilisation as well as those of other nationalities. “It is also our desire to use all legitimate mental and material resources of Yoruba people world-wide to advance the realisation of cultural, economic, and political autonomy for the Yoruba within the context of a multi-ethnic Nigerian democratic state,” he said.
