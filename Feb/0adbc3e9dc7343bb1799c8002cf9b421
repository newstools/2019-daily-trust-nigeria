Ahead of Saturday’s election, Kogi state governor, Yahaya Bello, has called on people of the state and all relevant stakeholders to work towards peaceful and rancour-free elections across the three Senatorial zones of state. In a statement signed by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Onogwu Muhammed, Governor Bello admonished the electorates and political actors in the state to conduct themselves in an orderly, mature and responsible manner before, during and after the election period. The governor, who warned troublemakers plotting to cause public disorder through any form of anti-social behaviour, said law enforcement agents have been fully mobilised by all the security agencies to deal with anyone found wanting. He assured the people of the state and election workers of their personal safety and security, and called on everyone to desist from acts capable of undermining the entire electoral process in the state. Governor Bello who craved for the neutrality, impartiality and independence of election workers, security personnel and independent observers, warned them against engaging in practices that could lead to the breakdown of law and order. While praying for peaceful elections in the state, the governor urged political actors and citizens to put the interest of the state above personal, group or primordial considerations, adding that elections should rather unite and not divide the people of the state. …As PDP vows to retain Kogi Our campaigns will be issue based — APC govs How PDP is picking its pieces in Kogi
