Making the donation to the school in Abuja, the student from the United States of America, said she heard about the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) with many children out of school and decided to assist the educational endeavours of the children. Guests at the occasion included the principal convener and Head of FCT Call Centre, Mrs. Jumai Ahmadu, the Director, FCT Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Alhaji Abbas Idriss, as well as a representative of the Universal Basic Education Board (UBEB), among others. In her remarks, Mrs. Ahmadu explained that Miss Arabelleâ€™s unrelenting desire to support the children prompted her to contact the Deputy Director of FEMA to partner with her, stressing that the school was selected because of the high number of IDPs that were among pupils of the school.
