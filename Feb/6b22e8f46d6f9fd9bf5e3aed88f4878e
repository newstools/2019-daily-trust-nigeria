The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has arrested a suspected fraudster, Yomi Akinwunmi, 57, who allegedly swindled three persons of N1.8 million in Ado-Ekiti. The victims, whose names were given as Oluwoye Taiwo, 32; Adeola Joseph, 71; and Yusuf Bamidele, 36, alleged that after Akinwunmi defrauded them of the sum under false pretence, he hypnotized them and they lost their memory of the incident. Parading the suspects before newsmen yesterday in Ado Ekiti, the NSCDC alleged that the suspect specialized in duping people in the Ekiti State capital under false pretence. Akinwunmi was arrested at a spot the police called his shrine in the Oke-Ila area of Ado-Ekiti following series of complaints lodged at the NSCDC headquarters about theÂ  suspect. It was gathered that when a search was conducted on the shrine, incriminating objects like charms, woman pants, a calabash and a picture of a popular prophet in the state capital were found. The suspect was said to have claimed, during questioning by the police, that the pant belonged to his wife. But the NSCDC said that the suspect was being economical with the truth on the ownership of the underwear found in his custody. The security outfit said the pant must have been forcefully obtained from a young lady. The Commandant of the NSCDC, Mr Solomon Iyamu, warned the people of the state to be satisfied with what they have, and warned traditional chiefs in the town to desist from shielding fraudsters in their districts, adding that anyone caught would be seriously dealt with.
