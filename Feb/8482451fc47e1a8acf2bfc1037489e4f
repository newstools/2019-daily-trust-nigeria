A former Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Chief Olabode George yesterday warned that the will of the people should prevail in the 2019 elections. Addressing newsmen in Lagos, George said he believes in the indivisibility and oneness of Nigeria and the forthcoming elections should not divide the country. According to him, irrespective of political party and religious divides, every Nigerian should perform his/her civic duty and be part of history. He charged the Independent National Electoral Commission’s chairman, Prof. Mamood Yakubu, to allow the will of the people to prevail. He said: “This election is special for Nigerians to take a decision on the future of our country. Nigeria is at a crossroads. We are at the precipice. I appeal to all Nigerians that this is a singular opportunity to address those areas that have plagued our development.” George warned that any attempt to compromise the elections could bring about consequences that would be unimaginable, adding, “We should take heed of the warnings of the international community. Don’t cause violence”. 2019: Nigerians must unite against violence –APGA National Chairman My husband will unite Nigerians, says Titi Atiku Insecurity: Bode George calls for emergency meeting of elders
