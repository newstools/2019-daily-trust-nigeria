Pakistan says it will respond “at the time and place of its choosing” after India launched strikes against militants in Pakistani territory. India said it had killed a large number of militants but Pakistan called the claim “reckless”. Tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours have been high following an attack on Indian troops in Kashmir. The attack was claimed by a group based in Pakistan, Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), and India had vowed to retaliate. India accuses Pakistan of allowing militant groups to operate on its territory, something Pakistan denies. Both India and Pakistan claim all of Muslim-majority Kashmir, but control only parts of it. The two have fought three wars and a limited conflict since independence from Britain in 1947 – and all but one were over Kashmir. The strikes are the first launched across the line of control – the de facto border that divides India-administered Kashmir from Pakistan-administered Kashmir – since a war between the two countries in 1971.
