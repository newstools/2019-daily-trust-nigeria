The governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Zamfara state, Dr. Bello Muhammad Mutawalle, on Friday said eight governorship candidates and six political parties had endorsed his candidature. Briefing newsmen in the aftermath of the court judgement that cleared way for APC candidates to participate in the 2019 general elections, Dr. Mutawalle said the judgement would not in any way affect his chance of winning the gubernatorial election in the state. He said his party would participate and they would win the elections because they partook in the massive campaign activities and they had showcased their noble manifestos to the public. Dr Mutawalle said with endorsement of the other opposition parties in the state, his candidature had received additional boost in the state. He then called on his supporters to shun violence during and after the polls adding that any well-meaning persons would not engage in acts that are capable of disrupting the polls or voting system.
