The Resident Electoral Commissioner in Akwa Ibom State, Mike Igini, has said over 1.6 million Permanent Voters’ Cards have been collected in the state. Speaking yesterday in Uyo during the signing of the peace accord by political candidates, Igini said these were out of over two million registered voters in the state. “For Akwa Ibom state, 2,119,727 registered voters in the state and well over 1.6million have their PVCs with them for this exercise. “There will be no use of incidence form in the 2019 elections. The collation process will be transparent for everybody to see; I know of no other way to give meaning and purpose to the ballot. “But I must inform here that you must get ready with your party agents and train them. The era of thugs at polling units is gone. We need people who understand processes and procedures. “We have developed tools measurable and reputable for the sustenance of democracy in our father land. I say this because out there, we have touts who are misleading the public. Deceiving most of our politicians, it is terrible, particularly, the incidence of vote buying,” he said.
