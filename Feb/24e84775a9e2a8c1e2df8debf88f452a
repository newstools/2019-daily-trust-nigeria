Ahead of Saturday’s 2019 general elections, Fulani across the country have been urged to shun all forms of political violence to ensure peaceful, free, fair and credible polls in the country. The call was made by a Fulani youth group while addressing a press conference in Kaduna. Chairman and Secretary of the group, Abdulkarim Bayero and Adams Nyoman respectively further appealed to all Fulani to remain law abiding citizens and embrace peace. They also urged them to come out en-mass on the presidential and governorship election days to vote for their respective candidates. “We are here to sensitize our members on the processes of election because Nigerians are no longer fools. We want our members to shine their eyes and choose a candidate that will revamp the economy and the agricultural sector through good governance, good policy and proper accountability.” They commended the peace building processes of the present administration saying, it has started yielding positive results. 2019: We’re not endorsing any candidate-Fulani groups 2019 Elections: Sultan urges Nigerians to shun conflict, violence 2019: Ebonyi APC to give women free nomination forms
