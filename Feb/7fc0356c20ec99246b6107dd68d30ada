The Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar will take his campaign train to Kano today as part of his campaign tour to the 36 states of the federation. Atiku, according to Senator Mas’ud El-Jibril Doguwa, will hold his campaign rally at Sani Abacha Stadium. It would be recalled that the PDP’s presidential candidate was earlier denied access to the stadium allegedly by the Kano State government, an allegation the government denied. Doguwa told Daily Trust that arrangements had been concluded to receive the PDP presidential flag bearer for the political rally. “Our people from the nook and cranny of the state are willing to receive our august visitor. I am sure the people of Kano will come out en mass to receive Atiku Abubakar,” he said. He appealed to all PDP members in the state to conduct themselves during the visit and desist from all forms of activities that might tarnish the image of the party and by extension the presidential candidate. On his part, the spokesperson of the PDP’s gubernatorial candidate in the state, Alhaji Sanusi Bature Dawakin Tofa told Daily Trust that PDP had concluded arrangements for the mega rally. 2019 campaigns: Story behind ‘mammoth’ crowds 6 Days to Presidential Poll: Buhari, Atiku in Final Push for Votes 2019 Campaigns Heat Up
