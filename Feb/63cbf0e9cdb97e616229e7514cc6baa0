The police in Ogun State said they have arrested a 45-year-old woman, Aderonke Ayinde, while she was attempting to dump the corpse of her lover in a bush. Ayinde’s arrest on Wednesday February 20, 2019 followed a report lodged at the Oke-Itoku police station, Abeokuta, by one Makinde Ishola that he had been informed that a middle-aged man, whose name was later known as Asimiu Abiodun, had visited the suspect at her residence situated at No. 1, Asalu Compound, Abeokuta. The police said that the complainant alleged that the man had died in the middle of the night in a questionable circumstance. The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, who confirmed the incident, said that the suspect took the corpse of the deceased to a nearby bush in the night and was dumping it there, not knowing that somebody nearby was observing her act. Oyeyemi said that based on the strength of the report, the Divisional Police Officer, Oke-Itoku Division, Superintendent Olatoye Kotonu, led detectives to the scene where the suspect was promptly arrested and the corpse evacuated to the mortuary for autopsy. “On interrogation, the suspect claimed that the deceased was her long-time lover who used to spend the night in her place, but who had on that fateful night suddenly developed a strange illness in the night and before she could call for help had given up the ghost. “She further stated that she decided to dispose of the body out of fear. The family of the deceased has been contacted by the police for proper identification,” he added.
