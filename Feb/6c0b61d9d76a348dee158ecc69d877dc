The National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) says it has arrested 355 suspects and secured the conviction 36 persons within 13 months in Yobe state. Speaking to newsmen, the commandant of the NDLEA in Yobe, Mr Ruben Ape, said the agency had confiscated 9.3kg of Indian hemp (Cannabis) and 1,084kg of other substances. “From last year to date, we have secured the conviction 36 persons at the Federal High Court, Damaturu and there are so many other cases pending in courts. The suspects would be prosecuted after due investigation” he said. He said that, two weeks ago, the operatives of the agency arrested two persons, Garba Mohammed, alias Malam Yahaya, and Umaru Baba with 360.6kg of weed that is suspected to be Indian hemp. “These suspects, who came all the way from Edo state were arrested in Damaturu. They were in an empty truck constructed with hidden compartments where the exhibit was concealed, the vehicle was visually empty but carrying 403 blocks of Cannabis that is 360.6kg of dry leaves suspected to be Indian hemp” he said. He explained that the suspects deceived security agencies on the road that they were looking for goods to carry but one of our officers saw the work done on the body of the truck to hide the exhibits and alerted his colleagues. “During the investigation, one of the suspects confessed that they have a supplier in Edo state, who has a farm for cultivating the leaf, and they supply to Borno and Yola most of the time. We intercepted them on their way to Maiduguri, Borno state” he added. He said the command would continue to map out strategies to ensure that the amount of illicit drugs in circulation was reduced in the state and urging parents and guardians to always monitor the activities of their children. 11 ladies, 269 others nabbed over drugs NDLEA seizes N80m Indian hemp in Benue Benue: NDLEA seizes N80m worth Indian hemp
