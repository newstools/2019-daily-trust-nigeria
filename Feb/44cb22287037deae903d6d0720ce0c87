A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Abubakar Kawu Baraje on Wednesday raised an alarm over alleged plans by the All Progressives Congress (APC) led federal government to deploy three commissioners of police, 12 deputy commissioners of police and  100 policemen attached to each police officers for the Kwara Central senatorial election on Saturday. Baraje who disclosed this while featuring on a special political radio programme in Ilorin, alerted the people of the state, particularly Kwara Central of the ploy by the APC-led government to wrestle power from the Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki by all means, especially by allegedly “manipulating the electoral process.” He therefore called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to be neutral and unbiased in conducting the first set of the election on Saturday, pointing out that the international community is keenly watching the events unfolding in the country. Baraje asked the security agencies, particularly the police, not to allow themselves to be used by the ruling party to manipulate the electoral process, stressing the need for them to discharge their duties professionally without taking sides. Baraje, therefore, told the people of the state to be wary of the antics of the APC, saying that it is only the PDP that could address the problem of insecurity and poverty ravaging a larger percentage of the citizens. He urged the people of the state to troop out en masse to cast their votes for all the candidates of the PDP in the polls.
