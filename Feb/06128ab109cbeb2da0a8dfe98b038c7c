 The Special Offences Court sitting in Ikeja, Lagos, on Friday remanded Marshall Obioma and his company, Southern Atlantic Global Enterprises, in prison custody for an alleged three-count charge of obtaining and stealing a sum of N192 million. Obioma, who was dragged to court by the EFCC, was alleged to have obtained the money in 2016 from one Nnamdi Ezeigbo as the cost of two plots of land in Oshorun Heritage Estate, Isheri, Lagos State. The defendant was, however, said to have failed to make available the plots of land or refund the complainant’s money. One of the counts reads that Obioma and Southern Atlantic Global Enterprises Limited sometime in 2016 fraudulently converted the sum of N170m, being the cost of 17 plots of land situated at Oshorun Heritage Estate, Isheri North of Isheri Town, Lagos State, property of Mr. Nnamdi Ezeigbo. He pleaded not guilty to the charge.  In view of his plea, the prosecution counsel, Franklin Ofoma, asked the court for a trial date and prayed that the defendant be remanded in prison custody.  However, the defence counsel, Clem Abuadinna, informed the court of a bail application for his client and prayed that the application be heard. The prosecution counsel confirmed receipt of the defendant’s application for bail and pleaded with the court for a short date to respond. ustice Mojisola Dada adjourned the matter to March 4, 2019 for commencement of trial and hearing of the bail application. The judge also remanded the defendant in prison custody.
