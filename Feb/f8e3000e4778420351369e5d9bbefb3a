A security guard’s wife, Usaina Sani has given birth to a set of male triplets and named them after President Muhammadu Buhari, APC governorship candidate, Mai Mala Buni and his running mate Idi Barde Gubana. Kanem Trust gathered that the 30-year-old Usaina, has been attending antenatal care but not aware that she was carrying three babies in her womb, until the day she delivered them on Friday at Nasarawa area, Damaturu, the Yobe state capital. She described the triplets as rare gifts from God that many families are longing to have. “To God be the glory, I delivered successfully and my triplets are very healthy. “I had a slight abdominal pain on Friday evening, all of sudden I was into labour. Before we mobilised to hospital I gave birth to one and on reaching the hospital, I made the remaining deliveries. God made it very easy for me because it was not different from the previous delivery, only that they were three this time,” she said. Malam Sani Ahmad, the father of the triplets said he was excited to have them in his family. “More importantly, it’s a safe delivery, my wife and children are in good health,” he said. Ahmadu, who has two wives and 13 children, said the triplets were delivered at the peak of electioneering period, which was why he decided to name them after the prominent candidates of the ruling APC. Ahmad said the arrival of the triplets has doubled the number of children he already has. “As God always plan, he will surely take care of all us.” He called on people to come and offer their assistance in either cash or kind in order to complement his effort in taking care of the triplets and their mother.
