The National Leader of the PDP and Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, yesterday, criticised President Muhammadu Buhari for directing security agents to deal ruthlessly with ballot box snatchers during the general elections. Speaking at a PDP youth rally in Ilorin where scores of defectors were received by the leaders of the party, Saraki said a president who loved his people would not have ordered soldiers to kill them. This is just as he expressed confidence that Atiku Abubakar would emerge as Nigeria’s new president tomorrow, pointing out that Nigerians’ support for the PDP’s presidential candidate across the length and breadth of the country was overwhelming. The PDP leader, who said the APC-led government had no agenda for either Nigeria or its people, enjoined the electorate to vote for Atiku “to say goodbye to hunger and poverty in Nigeria.” Saraki, who said the government of Atiku Abubakar had promised 40 per cent appointment for youths when elected, added that votes for PDP would ensure growth and development of Nigeria and Kwara State. The defectors included members of Mega Party of Nigeria, APC, ACPN, Action Alliance (AA) and Labour Party.
