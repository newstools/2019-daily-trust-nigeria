The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Uche Secondus has said the party is confident of winning the presidential election on Saturday. Secondus, who spoke with newsmen on Thursday in Abuja, also cautioned the security agencies against intimidating voters at the polling units during the polls. “I urge you Nigerians to refuse to be intimidated or provoked but remain focussed and fix your eyes on the ball, which is victory which is coming on Sunday. “The military must obey the rules of engagement. They shouldn’t be dragged into partisan politics. Any extra-judicial killing will attract the attention of the ICC. “Nigeria has been in coma for close to four years. But as soon as Atiku becomes President, he will get Nigeria working again,” Secondus said.
