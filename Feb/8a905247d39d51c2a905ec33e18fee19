The INEC in Niger State has formally replaced the name of Sen. David Umaru with that Mohammed Sani Musa as candidate of the APC for Niger East Senatorial district ahead of the rescheduled election slated for Feb. 23. The replacement was sequel to a Federal High Court judgement which declared Musa winner of the APC’s primaries held last year. Musa had approached the Federal High Court in Abuja asking it to set aside the nomination and/or submission of the name of Sen. Umaru as APC candidate for Niger East, saying he was the rightful owner of the ticket. The court subsequently granted his prayers and ordered INEC to effect the changes. But Sen. Umaru appealed the verdict at the Court of Appeal in Abuja and applied for stay of execution of the decision of the trial court. However, INEC headquarters in a letter to the Resident Electoral Commissioner (INEC) in the state, Prof. Sam Egwu, dated Feb. 15, directed him to substitute the name of Umaru earlier published with that of Musa as candidate. A letter which was signed by the secretary of the commission, Mrs. Rose Oriaran-Anthony, said: “The Commission pursuant to the order of the court in Suit No. FHC/ABJ/CS/140/2018 Mohammed Sani Musa V.APC and 2 others, has directed that the name of David Umaru earlier published as the candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC) for Niger East senatorial district be removed and replaced by the name of the plaintiff, Mohammed Sani Musa. “You are requested to update your record with respect to the above in view of the final list of candidates earlier forwarded to you please.” Niger East: INEC replaces Senator Umaru with Musa Niger East: Senator Umaru appeals court judgement nullifying his nomination Niger Senate: Court refuses Sani’s application to stop Umaru
