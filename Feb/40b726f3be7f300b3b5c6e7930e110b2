Ibadan Electricity Company (IBEDC) says it has energised electricity consumers in the ancient town of Ijaiye route Iseyin, Oyo State, after eight years of blackout. The energisation of the towns and villages became necessary following recent developments that have made the area a strategic economic location in Ibadan – the siting of the new railway terminus that will link to Agege Railway Terminus in Lagos state and the World Bank road project from Ijaiye to Iseyin – which will make the place a commercial hub for business in less than two years from now. According to IBEDC chief executive officer, Mr. John Donnachie, though the communities’ situation was an inherited challenge, the electricity distribution company can no longer close its eyes to the sufferings of its customers and the potentials in the fast-developing areas critical to its revenue generation. Under the arrangement, a daily 5-hour power supply is now being enjoyed by the communities and plans for eight hours will be realized within the next fortnight. Before now, the community’s monarch, Onijaiye of Ijaiye, Oba Lasisi Akano, had appealed to the management of IBEDC to take the ancient town as a new revenue generation opportunity owing to the infrastructural development taking place rapidly in the areas. The Regional Head (RH) of IBEDC Oyo region, Mr. Tope Bailey, along with the Regional Technical manager, Engr. Musbau Bello, expressed deep concern that such a big town with huge potentials was left to wallow in total neglect right before the advent of privatization. The RH immediately ordered an immediate power supply arrangement for the ancient town within Ojoo business hub coverage.
