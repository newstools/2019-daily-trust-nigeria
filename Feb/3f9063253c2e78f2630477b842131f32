MPs will have their say on the next steps for Brexit after European leaders indicated they would consider delaying the UK’s departure if a deal is not agreed by 29 March. Germany’s Angela Merkel said if the UK needed more time to get Parliament’s approval, she’d “not oppose” it. Theresa May said MPs will get a vote on delaying Brexit if her deal and a no-deal outcome are rejected. MPs will vote on amendments to a government motion in the Commons later. Wednesday’s votes are not on Mrs May’s Brexit deal itself – she says that will happen before 12 March. Instead, MPs are seeking assurances and to hold the PM to her commitment, made on Tuesday, to allow MPs a vote on extending 29 March’s Brexit deadline to avoid Britain leaving without a deal.
