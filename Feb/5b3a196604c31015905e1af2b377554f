The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has postponed this year’s general elections by one week. The chairman of the Commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, who cited logistics  and operational glitches for the shift, told newsmen at the commission’s headquarters after about six hours marathon meeting with the National Commissioners, that “this is inevitable.” According to him, the 2019 general elections earlier scheduled for Saturday, 16th February 2019 and Saturday, 2nd March 2019 will now hold on 23 February and 9 March this year. “Following a careful review of the implementation of its logistics and operational plan and the determination to conduct free, fair and credible elections, the commission came to the conclusion that proceeding with the elections as scheduled is no longer feasible. “Consequently, the commission has decided to reschedule the Presidential and National Assembly Elections to Saturday, 23ed February 2019. “Furthermore, the Governorship, State House of Assembly and FCT Area Council election is rescheduled to Saturday, 9th March 2019. “This will afford the commission the opportunity to address identified challenges in order to maintain the quality of our elections,” Prof. Yakubu said. He said it was a difficult decision for the commission to take, but necessary for the successful delivery of the elections and the consolidation of the nation’s democracy. He added that the commission will meet key stakeholders to update them on this development today at 2pm at the Abuja International Conference Centre (ICC).
