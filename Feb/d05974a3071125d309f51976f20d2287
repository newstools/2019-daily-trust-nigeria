The United Kingdom (UK) said it is seeking for improved growth in trade and investment relations with Nigeria. This was disclosed when a UK trade delegation made up of Dr. Maximilliano Mendez-Parra and Kingsley Onyeka of the International Economic Development Group (ODI) and Ilaria Chesa, Senior Trade Policy Adviser from the UK High Commission in Nigeria paid a study visit to the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) headquarters in Lagos on a fact finding interaction. Mendez-Parra said, “the UK government is passionate about issues that may be impeding access and the growth of trade and investment between the two countries. It is interested in finding solutions for trade issues, production and what products and services Nigeria may require from the UK.” He maintained that meeting SON was very important, as one of the recurrent issues in the whole of the EU and the UK inclusive is that of quality and compliance to standards by Nigerian products. The Director General of SON, Osita Aboloma, represented by the Director, Standards Development, Chinyere Egwuonwu (Mrs), expressed delight on the ongoing study on barriers to trade and investment between the two countries. She said SON is affiliated to international standardisation bodies like the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), Codex Alimentarius Commission, International Electro-technical Commission (IEC) and other continental and regional bodies and elaborate in line with international principles to enhance trade and adoption, harmonisation and domestication of standards for implementation in Nigeria.
