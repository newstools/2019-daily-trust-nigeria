Sudan’s President Omar al-Bashir has ridiculed his opponents’ use of social media to organise recent protests against his rule. “Changing the government or presidents cannot be done through WhatsApp or Facebook. It can be done only through elections,” he told his supporters. He was speaking as fresh demonstrations were held in the capital Khartoum. The protests started over cuts to bread subsidies in December but have since morphed into anger at Mr Bashir’s rule. The Sudanese government says 30 people have been killed in clashes since the unrest began. Human rights groups put the death toll at more than 40. Mr Bashir used a rally of his supporters in the eastern city of Kassala to mock his political opponents. He said only elections could bring about a change of government. “This is our pledge and commitment before the Sudanese people. The decision is your right, the masses of the Sudanese people,” the president said.
