An FCT High Court in Maitama has rejected an application by former National Security Adviser (NSA), Sambo Dasuki to invite amicus curiae (independent persons) to intervene in his matters. In one of the matters, Dasuki was arraigned along with former Minister of Finance (State), Bashir Yuguda, former Sokoto State governor, Attahiru Bafarawa and son, Sagir Bafarawa, and a firm, Dalhatu Investment Limited on a 25-count charge bordering on criminal breach of trust, misappropriation of public funds to the tune of N19. 4billion. At the resumed hearing of the case yesterday, Dasuki’s counsel, Adeola Adedipe named some Senior Advocates of Nigeria to make up for the amicus curiae among whom are Femi Falana, Onyechi Ikpeazu and Olisa Agbakoba. Responding, however, prosecution counsel, Rotimi Jacobs (SAN) told the court that the issue could only be applicable where there are issues that the court cannot handle within the law. Ruling on the application, the trial judge, Justice Husseini Baba-Yusuf held that the application did not meet with the conditions for the order of amicus curiae to be granted. He, therefore, dismissed the application. In the other case where Dasuki was charged with a former NNPC Executive Director, Aminu Baba-Kusa and two firms – Acacia Holdings and Reliance Referral Hospital, the judge fixed Feb. 27 to rule on the application by Dasuki asking for indefinite adjournment pending when the judgment of Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of a Federal High Court Abuja on July 2, 2018, ordering his release is complied with by the government.
