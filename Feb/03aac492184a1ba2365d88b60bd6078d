A clingy octopus held on to a diver’s back even after he jumped out of the sea. Giuseppe Tortorella was diving off Torre del Greco in Naples when his friend Roberto started to come to the surface. But Roberto wasn’t alone as he clambered back on to the boat. A bright red octopus was holding on tight to the back of his wetsuit. Trying desperately to separate himself, the octopus tentacles proved to be too strong as he stayed attached for almost three minutes before finally being dropped back into the sea. Mr Tortorella said: ‘We think the octopus latched on while Roberto was trying to catch a fish and it got spooked. ‘It was originally on his arm and then moved over as he came to the surface. ‘Because the outer surface of his suit was very smooth, he couldn’t get rid of him. ‘I could have helped but I was enjoying the scene too much.’ Culled from dailymail.co.uk  Cat Baidian’er which predicted Nigeria-Argentina match dies If Ilan Smith were a Nigerian… A Day Trip to Dibba Musandam in the Sultanate of Oman
