The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has declared the Okigwe zone Senatorial seat and Okigwe South Federal Constituency  seat inconclusive. The action, according to the INEC’s Returning Officer, Prof Donatus Ihejianya, followed cancellation of votes from Isiala Mbano, Ehime Mbano and Ihitte Uboma local government areas. INEC’s spokesperson in the state, Emmanuella Okpara, who confirmed the development, said the ward collation officer, Dr Bethel Uzoho, had confirmed that there was no collation at the ward level. She said that similarly, the Federal Constituency Returning Officer, Prof Cyril Duru, gave the results from Ihitte Uboma as APC had 3,808 votes and PDP had 6,067 votes while that of Obowo stood at APC – 5,259 and PDP – 4,512. She noted that the result for Ehime Mbano, according to him, was not returned because the local government collation officer was yet to be seen. She added that some units in Obowo, one in Ehime ward, nine in Okenalogho and another in Dim-na-Eze were cancelled. Okpara said new date for the elections will be announced by the commission. #NigeriaDecides: Atiku leads in Imo state Osun Election: PDP rejects rerun,heads to court over INEC’s declaration Violence erupts at Ikeja collation centre, leaves PDP candidate unconscious
