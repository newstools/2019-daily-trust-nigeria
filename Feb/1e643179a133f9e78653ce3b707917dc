City News had reported that the housewife, and her children, Abdul and Bilkisu, were abducted in the early hours of Wednesday at Anguwar Abattoir by gunmen who invaded their apartment in the area. A member of the victims’ family, who preferred anonymity, confirmed their release to our reporter yesterday. He said the sum of N500,000 was paid to the kidnappers after negotiations with them. He said the ransom was given to the kidnappers through a close friend of the woman’s husband, after they were able to establish contact with them on Wednesday morning. He said the woman and her two children were hale and hearty. “We thank God that a good Samaritan who is a close friend of the husband intervened to raise the N500,000 and gave it to them before they were released unhurt,” he said. When contacted, the spokesman of the FCT police command, DSP Anjuguri Manzah, said he will contact the police division in Abaji to confirm and get back to our reporter.
