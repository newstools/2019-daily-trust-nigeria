An Ogba chief magistrate court in Lagos has ordered that a 34-year-old man, Trust Ezekiel, be remanded in prison till hearing in the case of sodomy against him begins. The police had dragged Ezekiel to court yesterday over allegations of assaulting a 10-year-old boy and having anal sex with him. The prosecutor, Mr Danny Raphael, told the court that the incident happened on January 29, 2019 at Paul Anyanwu Street, Ijanikin, Lagos, where the accused and the boy reside with his parents. Raphael said the accused lured the boy into his apartment, removed the boy’s clothes and forced his manhood into the minor’s private part. He alleged that the accused pushed the boy out of his one-room apartment after he had concluded the act, with a warning not to tell anyone about what happened. Luck was, however, said to have run against Ezekiel when blood started dripping from the boy’s anus. The court did not take Ezekiel’s plea after the prosecutor informed it that the victim was a minor and advice from the Laos State Department of Public Prosecution would be needed on the matter. Thus, the magistrate, Mrs B.O. Osunsanmi, ordered Ezekiel to be remanded in prison without an option of bail. The court also directed the prosecutor to duplicate the file and send it to the DPP for advice.
