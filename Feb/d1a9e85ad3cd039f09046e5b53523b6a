Shamima Begum – the London teenager who left the UK to join the Islamic State group in Syria – has given birth, her family have been told. Their lawyer released a statement saying Ms Begum and her child – a boy – are believed to be in “good health”. Ms Begum, who was found last week by the Times in a Syrian refugee camp, has said she wanted to return to the UK. The 19-year-old told Sky News from the camp “a lot of people should have sympathy towards me”. “I didn’t know what I was getting into when I left,” she said. She said she made a mistake “in a way” by going to Syria, but added: “I don’t regret it because it’s changed me as a person, made me stronger, tougher. “I did have a good time there. It’s just that then things got harder and I couldn’t take it anymore.” In an interview with the Times, published on 13 February, Ms Begum said she was heavily pregnant and wanted to come home to the UK for her baby’s health.
