According to the statement from National Coordinating Consultant, NIRSAL MFB,Â  Dr Steve Olusegun Ogidan said the new institution, NIRSAL Microfinance Bank (NMFB) will expand available options and empower SMEs across Nigeria with structured microcredit to help them establish and expand their businesses.
