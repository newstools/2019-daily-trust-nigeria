The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) temporarily suspended the Do-Not-Disturb (DND) 2442 short-code to enable telecommunication operators disseminate voter education information to Nigerians ahead of the general elections. The 2442 DND short-code enables Nigerian subscribers to bar or stop unsolicited SMS adverts sent to their lines by telecom operators (telcos). But NCC in a statement yesterday, said upon due consideration of the upcoming general elections, it decided to temporarily suspend its direction to telcos on DND in order to enable them disseminate specific information on voter education on behalf of INEC. The commission said in implementing the suspension, telcos were to be mindful of existing directives regarding the timing and regularity of such messages and the fact that the temporary suspension was only with regards to the specific messages on voter education. However, NCC in a paid advert published in some newspapers yesterday, said telcos should ensure that their facilities were not used to disseminate political or religious contents which were abusive, insulting, intimidating and harassing, and/or which incited violence, hatred or discrimination against any person or group.
