Thousands of residents on Friday fled from their homes as Boko Haram terrorists attacked a community near Maiduguri in Jere local government area of Borno state, a resident told Daily Trust. The resident, Abu Shuaibu, said the insurgents stormed the Zabbamari town, some 10 kilometres away from Maiduguri, Borno state capital, shooting sporadically and killing many civilians as well as burnt down many houses. “The insurgents came around 5:30pm and they were engaged by soldier but unfortunately they overpowered troops. “We are currently in Gongolo village, many people were killed but thousands are fleeing to Maiduguri as I am speaking with you. “The soldiers tried but they told us that their bullets have finished; so, we fled together; Boko Haram are currently there now,” said Abu. It will be recalled that Zabbamari village, which inhabits about 50,000 residents, is a rice community in Jere LGA.
