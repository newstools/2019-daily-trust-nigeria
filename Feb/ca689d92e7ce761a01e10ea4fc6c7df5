Ahead of tomorrow’s elections, 12 presidential candidates have endorsed the candidature of President Muhammadu Buhari. Presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, in a statement said the 12 candidates had directed all their members and supporters to vote for President Buhari tomorrow. The 12 candidates under the auspices of ‘Forum of Presidential Candidates and Political Parties for Good Governance’ endorsed President Buhari during a courtesy call to the State House, yesterday. Chairman of the forum, Shitu Mohammed Kabir of Advanced Peoples Democratic Alliance (APDA), said they decided to throw in their lot with President Buhari because of advances made in security, economy, fighting corruption, infrastructural development, agricultural revolution, and many others. “We, therefore, wish to support President Buhari’s candidacy in the coming election, and direct all our teeming members across the length and breadth of Nigeria to go out in their numbers to vote for APC candidates, Muhammadu Buhari/Yemi Osinbajo, in the election,” he said. Members of the forum that acquiesced to the endorsement included Hon Edozie Madu, Independent Democrats; Danjuma Mohammed, Movement for Restoration & Defence of Democracy; Yusuf Nadabo Dantalle, Allied Peoples Movement; Ahmed Buhari, Save Nigeria Party; and Alhaji Isah B. Dansarki, Mass Movement of Nigeria. Others were Ikechukwu Nwaokafor, Advance Congress of Democrats; Alista Soyode, Yes Party; Barrister Charles Ogbali, Advanced Nigeria Democratic Party; Kenneth Ibe Kalu, United Peoples Congress; Comrade Isiyaka Paul Femili, Nigeria Element Progressive Party; and Robinson Akpu, National Democratic Liberty Party. Responding, President Buhari said there was compelling need for historians and economists to document the 16 years squander-mania and mismanagement by the PDP so that future generations would not repeat the same mistakes. #2019Election Buhari basking in popularity, Atiku on affinity in Bauchi 2019: Arewa Community promises Buhari, Abiodun 300,000 votes in Ogun 12 presidential candidates endorse Buhari
