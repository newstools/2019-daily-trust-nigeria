Three additional Police Commissioners have been deployed to supervise elections in Ogun State alongside the incumbent Commissioner in charge of the command, Ahmed Iliyasu. They are Gbenga Adeyanju who would man Ogun Central; Yemi Agunbiade for Ogun East, while Fimihan Adeoye would be in charge of Ogun West Senatorial districts during the elections. The Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) in Charge of Election Duties (Southwest), Yakubu Jubril disclosed this on Thursday at a meeting with stakeholders held at the State Police headquarters, Eleweran, Abeokuta, ahead of the Saturday’s polls. He explained that the move was to provide adequate security for both February 16 and March 2 elections in the state. Yakubu warned political actors to prevail on their supporter to eschew violence in the interest of the state. He said “I appeal to the actors that they should please talk to their supporters. They should not foment trouble. Police Command in Ogun will not condone any act of thuggery or anything that would affect the election. “I have told them to talk to their supporters because in most cases it is their supporters that cause problems. They CP has told me that he has identified some of the flashpoints where these criminals are hiding and we are already working on that. “And I am very positive with what I have seen on ground that this election is going to be free, fair and credible. At the end of it all, we will all have cause to smile.” Community policing has paid off in Ogun, says CP Community policing yielding good results in Ogun — CP Election: Police ban ‘unapproved’ security outfits
