Attempt to frustrate and undermine the electoral process will not affect the commitment of people in Niger State in returning President Muhammadu Buhari in the rescheduled polls, the APC in the state has said. In a statement yesterday, the state chairman of the party, Engr. Mohammed Jibril Imam, said reports of attempt by certain individuals to derail the democratic process through untoward means were disturbing and a desperation taken too far. According to him, Niger as one of Buhari’s support bases would not be deterred by the antics of desperate politicians, adding that such moves would further win sympathy for the president in the state. Imam urged APC supporters and the people of the state to sustain their support for the party, President  Buhari and Governor Abubakar Sani Bello despite postponement of the elections last weekend.
