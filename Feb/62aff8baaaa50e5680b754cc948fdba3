The Gombe State Command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) said it would deploy over 700 personnel for the forthcoming presidential and national assembly elections. The state Commandant of the NSCDC, Mrs Altine Umar, disclosed this on Wednesday while briefing newsmen on the command preparations ahead of the elections. She warned the general public against causing violence during and after announcement of the elections’ results, adding that anyone found wanting would be prosecuted. Mrs Altine also called on religious and traditional leaders to preach to their followers and subjects to be law-abiding to ensure credible and peaceful elections. The commandant also called on politicians to be law-abiding and accept the outcome of the elections in good faith, “as there must be a winner and loser in every contest.” Altine assured members of the public that going by the synergy among the various security agencies in the state, the election will be peaceful. “All the security agencies in the state have prepared for the forthcoming elections and we all pledged that there will be no compromise in the discharge of our duty,” she said.
