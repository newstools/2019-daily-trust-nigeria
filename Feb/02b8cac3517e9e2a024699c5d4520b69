Stakeholders in the nation’s oil and gas sector, yesterday, restated their call on the  Federal Government on the need to fully liberalise the downstream oil sub-sector. They said if that was not done, subsidy on imported refined products would continue to be a recurring factor in the country’s energy mix. According to the Chief Executive Officer/Executive Secretary, Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), Mr Clement Isong, the downstream petroleum industry regulations should be in line with international best practices. He said with the implementation and compliance with these regulations, the concept of cost recovery and competitive investment returns will ensure the sustainability of the downstream petroleum industry. He said, “As the market players grow their business, they will increasingly become exposed to risk management challenges and will move their capital to areas where returns match the risks. “We recommend that government should deregulate pump prices and focus on enforcing compliance with adequate regulations on health, safety, environment and quality.” The Executive Secretary, Depot and Petroleum Products Marketers Association of Nigeria (DAPPMAN), Mr Olufemi Adewole, said rise in the landing cost of petroleum products led to renewed calls for the full deregulation of the downstream subsector of the nation’s oil and gas industry. Also, the National President of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), Mr Chinedu Okoronkwo, said total deregulation of the downstream sector would also attract more investment, generate more jobs and reduce the pressure on foreign reserves. Okoronkwo stressed the need for total deregulation and liberalisation of the downstream market to address the persistent challenges in the oil and gas industry.
