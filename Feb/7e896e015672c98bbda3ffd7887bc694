Somalia has rejected an accusation by Kenya that it has auctioned off oil and gas blocks in a disputed maritime area claimed by Kenya. It described the claim as non-factual, adding that the oil fields were in their own waters and none had been auctioned. On Saturday, Kenya recalled its ambassador to Mogadishu over the dispute. The International Court of Justice is hearing a case related to it. Somalia gets big EU pledge to end conflict Al-Shabab ''kills''  Burundian troops 3 killed in mortar attack near Presidential Palace
