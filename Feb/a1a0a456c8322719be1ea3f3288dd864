Bappa gave the advice during a sensitisation campaign organised for secondary school students on the dangers of drug abuse and human trafficking at Government Senior Secondary School (GSSS) Gwagwalada, yesterday. He said the secretariat was keen on issues that would end such ugly development, hence its desire to organise the campaign for secondary school students. He advised the students to stay away from drug abuse, saying such act had potential of jeopardising their future.  He said the sensitisation programme was designed to raise awareness among the youth who were the target population for drug abuse. Bappa emphasised that health and social hazards of involvement in drugs have enormous consequences on families.
