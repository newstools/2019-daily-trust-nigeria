The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Zonal Commanding Officer for Zone 10 Sokoto, Kayode Olagunju, has warned motorists and other road users on political campaign movements to stop dangerous driving and other unsafe acts that put their lives at risks, or face arrest and prosecution. “Only those who are alive can exercise their civic responsibility of voting during the elections,” he asserted. The Assistant Corps Marshal Olagunju noted that many drivers in the Zone, comprising of Sokoto, Kebbi and Zamfara states attending political rallies drive dangerously, overload their vehicles with many hanging on top of the vehicles and some seated in the booths/trunks of the vehicles and often drive above the speed limits. He added: “These acts, contrary to Section 10 of the FRSC (Establishment) Act, 2007, result in avoidable injuries and loss of lives and property.” He warned that those violating traffic rules and regulations would be arrested and prosecuted accordingly. Olagunju harped on the need for all road users to always be safety-conscious and abide by all safety regulations. He also spoke against the act of covering of vehicle number plates. “This illegal conduct, has both safety and security implications. Sections 10 (4) (h) and 10 (4) (s) of the FRSC (Establishment) Act, 2007 make it mandatory for Vehicle Identification Mark (Number Plates) to be conspicuously displayed on the vehicles,” he stated. The Zonal Commander also said:” The National Road Traffic Regulations (NRTR), 2012 in Sections 36 and 39 also make it an offence not to properly display vehicle identification number plates.” He asserted that such vehicles would be impounded and the violators arrested and prosecuted accordingly.
