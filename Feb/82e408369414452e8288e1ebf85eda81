He explained that the returning officer for Tudun Wada/Kabong ward had been arrested with a man who claimed to be the APC agent when the APC chairman for Jos North denounced him. The collation officer also announced that unit 005 in Naraguta B of Jos North had been cancelled because of the mutilation of the polling unit result sheets and excessive use of correction fluid which made the results unreadable. Azi also explained that, “unit 009 was cancelled due to the non use of the smart card reader while unit 087 was cancelled because the presiding officer had absconded with the result sheets.” He said the presiding officer for unit 009 had told them that though the smart card reader was functional, he had been under pressure by the community to vote manually.
