The Acting Inspector General of Police, Mr. Mohammed Adamu, has redeployed three Commissioners of Police (CPs) to Ekiti State to monitor Saturday’s presidential election. The three newly redeployed police commissioners are to join the Ekiti Commissioner of Police, Mr. Asuquo Amba, to ensure that the exercise is hitch-free across the state. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state command, DSP Caleb Ikechukwu, who made the disclosure in Ado Ekiti on Friday, however, did not disclose the names of the new CPs. He said each of the CPs would monitor each of the senatorial districts of the state. To curb vote buying during the election, Ikechukwu said the Force would deploy 2,195 plain clothed operatives to all the polling units to arrest the perpetrators. “The operatives will mingle with voters and from there, have the knowledge of those engaging in this electoral offence”, he said. Ikechukwu said the security details of Very Important Personalities, including politicians in the state have been withdrawn, with the exception of that of Governor Kayode Fayemi and his deputy, Chief Bisi Egbeyemi.
