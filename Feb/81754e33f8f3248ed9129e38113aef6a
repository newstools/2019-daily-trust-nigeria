The lawmaker representing Tambuwal-Kebbe federal constituency, Abdussamad Dasuki, has urged members of his constituency to protect their votes during the forthcoming elections. Addressing his supporters while rounding up his polling units campaigns in Kebbe local government area, he said the state would not go back to APC because of the neglect it suffered in terms of federal government’s projects. Dasuki was optimistic that the people of the state would vote massively for PDP’s candidates at the polls. He added “this is because they have utmost belief in PDP’s ability to take them to the high level and solve their problems.” Dasuki, who is the Chairman House Committee on Navy, promised to bring more developmental projects to his constituency. “I will also secure jobs for our teeming youth, provide scholarship to them and also support our farmers,” he added Tribunal upholds Dasuki’s election in Sokoto Election tribunal receives 5  petitions in Sokoto Tambuwal: Court Okays Sokoto constituent’s application on joinder
