The directive given by President Muhammadu Buhari on what awaits those planning to rig tomorrow’s elections and subsequent ones has made those with sinister motives jittery, the Buhari Campaign Organisation (BCO) said yesterday. The BCO, therefore, commended the president for exposing the rigging plot of the opposition through his directive to the military and other security agencies that they should deal ruthlessly with ballot box snatchers and other election riggers in tomorrow’s elections. In a statement, yesterday, by its Director of Communication and Strategic Planning, Malam Gidado Ibrahim, BCO said what the president did was burst the grand plan of the opposition for Nigerians to know what was happening. BCO said by their responses, Buhari’s order was a clear indication that the PDP and its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, were planning to rig the 2019 polls. “We in the BCO give kudos to Mr. President for this marching order,” Ibrahim said in the statement. “Only the evil-minded should be afraid of the order. The opposition are criticising President Buhari for his comment on ballot box snatchers because they want Nigerians to see nothing of those who denied them electricity and other infrastructure in the past 16 years,” he added. “No true Nigeria will vote for PDP. The PDP was in power for 16 years and there were no good roads and no power when the PDP presidential candidate was the chairman that privatized NEPA then,” he added.
