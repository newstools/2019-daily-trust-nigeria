The Deputy Inspector General (DIG) in charge of North Central, Godwin Nwobodo, has urged Abuja residents to see the forthcoming elections as part of the nation’s independence celebration and not a threat to national security. Nwobodo, who is also the DIG in charge of ICT, made the call, yesterday, during his visit to the FCT Police Command Headquarters for an interactive session with traditional leaders and other major stakeholders for the forthcoming elections. He said it behoved on all leaders to prevail on those under their influence to ensure the peaceful conduct of the election, adding that the police would carry out their responsibility of ensuring the country continues to exist peacefully. Nwobodo also warned policemen who would be deployed for the elections not to abandon electoral officers midway. “No policeman closes until the election results are collated and declared in FCT,” he said while directing senior officers to ensure full compliance of officers and men under their watch. On his part, the Head of Operations of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the FCT, Alhaji Umar Ahmadu, stressed that the presence of the police, not only during the voting process, but at all collation centres will ensure the peaceful conduct of the election. “We have 62 wards, 871 Polling Units and 2,822 Voting Points in the FCT and security is required for all of these as well as for escort of both sensitive and non-sensitive election materials; INEC office and at Area Councils,” Ahmadu said.
