Senator Philip Tanimu Aduda, representing the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) has said he was disappointed by the postponement of the presidential and National Assembly elections earlier scheduled for February 16, 2019 by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Aduda, who is seeking re-election to the Senate for the third time on the platform of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), spoke with newsmen in Abuja yesterday. He called on his supporters to remain calm and persevere, as they would have the opportunity to cast their votes on the rescheduled date of February 23. “I empathise with the entire voters in the FCT and other millions of Nigerians whose hopes have been dashed by this, especially for workers, businessmen and women, students and even people whose ceremonies were slated to hold but were shifted for the sake of the elections,” he said. He added “Let’s continue on this path together, in our quest for a greater FCT, and Nigeria. Let us all come out en masse to cast our votes for all the PDP candidates across board, so we can get Nigeria working again.”  We know the formulae to unseat Aduda – Buhari campaign DG APC used thugs to win last FCT area council polls – Aduda APC kicks as tribunal upholds Aduda, Jisalo’s elections
