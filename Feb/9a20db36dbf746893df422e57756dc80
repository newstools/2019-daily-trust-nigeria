Pakistan has hit back at the allegations by India that it is harbouring fighters from the armed group that claimed responsibility for the last week’s deadly attack on a paramilitary convoy in Indian-administered Kashmir. Thursday’s car bomb attack, which killed 42 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel, was claimed by the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM). Following the blast, New Delhi called for “the complete isolation of Pakistan” with Prime Minister Narendra Modi promising a “strong response”.
