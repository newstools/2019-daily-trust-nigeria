The Resident Electoral Commissioner for Niger state, Prof Sam Egwu, has debunked reports of missing ballot papers for Niger East and Niger North senatorial districts. Media reports quoted the REC as saying during an interactive session with newsmen that ballot for the areas could not be traced. According to the reports, the anomaly has already been communicated to headquarters in Abuja for urgent attention. However, Prof. Egwu told Daily Trust on telephone that no ballots were missing as reported. “As we speak, I’m taking delivery of the remaining sensitive materials at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) office in Minna. “As I’m also speaking with you, vehicles for conveying the materials for their respective destinations are waiting to move tonight,” he explained. Prof. Egwu equally pointed out that all facilities for the conduct of free and fare elections in Niger state have been provided with the non-sensitive materials already moved to various destinations across the 25 local government areas of the state. He urged journalists to avoid misconceptions and always verify reports before going to press. He said INEC in Niger state is 100 percent ready for tomorrow’s exercise even as he assured that the Commission would ensure free and fair polls. 2,167,788 voter’s cards collected in Niger, says REC INEC begins deployment of sensitive materials Does Jega’s argument add up?
