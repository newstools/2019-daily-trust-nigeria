Polling Units and Registration Areas would be relocated from areas with security problems to safer places for the smooth conduct of the forthcoming general elections in Zamfara state, the Resident Electoral Commissioner in the state, Dr Asma’u Maikudi, has said. Briefing newsmen on the preparation of the forthcoming general elections in the state, Dr Maikudi said they have directed all the electoral officers in the local government to meet with the stakeholders on the matter. “We asked the electoral officers in the local governments to meet security agencies, traditional rulers and other stakeholders to identify the polling units and registration areas with security threats for possible relocation if need be. “It is an open secret that there is insecurity. On whether elections will hold in those areas or not, there are two options here, either for security operatives to provide adequate cover to those areas or we relocate them,” she added. She said voters would be informed via media and possibly town criers about the decision and where their polling units and registration areas have been relocated to. On the issue of internally displaced camps in the state, the commissioner said even though there was no established official IDP’s camp in the state, the internally displaced persons residing outside the state will participate only in presidential polls.
