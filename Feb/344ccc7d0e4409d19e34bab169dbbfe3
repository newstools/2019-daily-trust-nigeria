Traders, under the aegis of Wuse Market Association, have endorsed the candidature of the All Progressive Congress, APC, presidential candidate, President Muhammadu Buhari. The Secretary of the association, Alhaji Abubakar Abdullahi Dangara, who spoke at a ceremony organized in front of the market, said they backed the re-election bid of President Buhari because of his antecedents of fulfilling promises made during campaigns. Dangara said the TraderMoney and N-Power programmes had produced positive impacts on the life of the beneficiaries, stressing that it enhances economic activities in the market. The leader of Wuse Market Women, Mrs Oluwatosin Badmus, who invited the beneficiaries of TraderMoney programme, said the scheme had no political undertone as nobody was told to present his permanent voter’s cards. “TraderMoney is not vote buying. We, in the market, have decided to endorse Buhari because he is not for the elites. Buhari is for us, the masses and we are the masses. People from Karu and Kado markets are also with us here today,” said Mrs Badmus.
