The secretary of the Kaduna State branch of the Jama’atu Nasril Islam (JNI), Ibrahim Kufena, has asked the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) to avoid making comments based on the last week’s attacks in Kajuru. Kufena, in a statement yesterday, said: “The position CAN took that nobody was killed is amounting to shielding criminals that committed this dastardly act which is most unfortunate.” The chairman of the Mobgal Fulbe Development Association, Ahmad Mairiga Yandeh, described the attack as a heinous crime. He said his association would soon come up with the accurate casualty figure.
