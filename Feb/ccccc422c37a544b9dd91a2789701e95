The Divisional Police Officer of the Ago Palace Way Division, Chief Superintendent Oyin Frances Adamu, and the stationâ€™s Divisional Crime Officer, Superintendent Oladimeji Olatunji, have been queried over their alleged failure to prevent the violence that erupted in Okota, Lagos, during the elections last Saturday. Hoodlums had gone on rampage at polling centres on Ago Palace Way and Canal Estate in the Okota area destroying ballot boxes and ballot papers. The hoodlums, according to reports, also attacked voters. Daily Trust learnt that following the crisis, both Adamu and Olatunji were given 24 hours to explain why disciplinary action should not be taken against them for failing to protect officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and electoral materials. It was also learnt that aside from failing to handle the security situation, the two police officers allegedly attempted to divert the attention of the Assistant Inspector-General of Police (AIG), Zone 2, David Folawiyo, and the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Muazu Zubairu, from doing an on-the-spot assessment of the extent of damage in the area. A police source said that before leaving the crisis area on Saturday around 4pm, Zubairu ordered the Area Commander, Olasoji Akinbayo, to issue the two officers queries for allowing hoodlums to wreak havoc in the area. The source added that the two officers had been issued with the queries by 7pm yesterday and were asked to explain why they chose to be unprofessional by disobeying the lawful orders of their superior officers. The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Chike Oti, when asked by Daily Trust to confirm the development, said he had not been fully briefed on the issue but promised to get back to our correspondent on it.
