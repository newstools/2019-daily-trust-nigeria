The All Progressives Congress (APC) has called on Nigerians, party members and supporters to pray for peace and success of the forthcoming 2019 general elections. The APC National Publicity Secretary, Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, who made the call on Thursday, cautioned all Nigerians and party members not to be involved in any act of electoral malpractice and irregularities. Issa-Onilu said, “We should stay safe and work collectively to ensure that the general elections are free, fair, transparent and credible. “Security agencies have been given the marching order to bring the full weight of our laws to bear on anyone that perpetrates violence or electoral offence no matter how highly placed. “We encourage our members to come out to vote and protect the ballots. Our great party has enough support nationwide to win with a landslide. We must now work to ensure that the election is decided by one man, one vote, which guarantees our victory. “We caution Nigerians and all involved in the electoral process not to be influenced by huge money the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is moving around to buy votes and compromise the system. “Our future should not be mortgaged to the leaders of PDP who are using our commonwealth they stole over 16 years to seek a return to power.” We'll field candidates in Zamfara, Rivers - APC Atiku’s decision to sign peace deal face-saving move – APC Onnoghen:  You are sympathetic to corruption, APC tells PDP
