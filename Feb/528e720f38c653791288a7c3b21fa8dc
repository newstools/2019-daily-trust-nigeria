The Apapa Area 1 Command of the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS), yesterday, said it raked in N404 billion in 2018 as against N350.9 billion it generated during the same period in 2017. The Customs Area Controller of the command, Bashir Abubakar, who made this known while briefing newsmen in Lagos, said the amount realised was 95 per cent of the 2018 revenue target of N426.1bn. Abubakar said it showed that the command collected N53bn above the revenue generated in 2017, which he said was a remarkable achievement. Abubakar who attributed the success to the selfless stance of the officers and men, as well as the support and back-up by the Comptroller General of Customs, Hammed Ali, and his management team, also noted that the other strategies the command adopted led to the success.
