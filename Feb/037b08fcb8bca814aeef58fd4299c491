The Ekiti State police command has warned against the use of face mask by commercial motorcycle operators in the state. The command’s Public Relations Officer, Deputy Superintendent Caleb Ikechukwu, in a statement yesterday said the command had declared zero tolerance on the use of face mask and covering of the face by the ‘okada’ operators in the state, warning that defaulters would face the wrath of the law. The statement said that the police had discovered through intelligence gathering that some person(s) who engage in the commercial motorcycle business were using face mask to cover their faces in order to perpetrate heinous crimes. “In order not to get caught, they employ the use of face mask to hide their identities. Owing to many complaints received from the general public as regarding the use of face mask by these ‘okada’ riders to commit crime, the command warns that with effect from February  11, 2019, anyone caught violating this directive will be arrested and prosecuted accordingly,” the police stated. The command said only medically-approved nose mask and helmet would be allowed for use, adding, “This is done for the purpose of ease in doing business in Ado-Ekiti and for Nigerians in the state.”  Lagos and the ‘golden rules’ for commercial motorcyclists Motorcycle ban creates ‘curfew’ in Maiduguri Okada riders to embark on ‘mother of all protests’ over extortion by policemen
