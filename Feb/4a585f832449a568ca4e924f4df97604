Sudan’s President Omar al-Bashir has declared a national state of emergency, dismissed the federal government and sacked all state governors. Mr Bashir made the announcement in a TV address to the nation, but later appointed members of the security forces as replacement governors. Earlier, Sudan’s National Security and Intelligence Services (NISS) said that Mr Bashir would be stepping down. Mr Bashir has been the focus of anti-government protests in recent weeks. Protesters took to the streets after the announcement in the city of Omdurman but were met with tear gas by police. In the address, Mr Bashir asked parliament to postpone constitutional amendments that would allow him to run for another term. Mr Bashir also said the demonstrations were an attempt to destabilise the country. “I announce imposing a state of emergency across the country for one year,” he said. “I announce dissolving the government at the federal level and at the provincial levels.” Hassan Al-Turabi:  One more arrest for the Islamist opposition leader I won’t step down over protests, says Sudan’s Bashir A peace deal for South Sudan is signed.
