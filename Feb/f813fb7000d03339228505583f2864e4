The PDP has asked INEC to within 48 hours publish the names of electoral officers that will conduct the presidential election. The party claimed that INEC had obtained names of the electoral officers and ad hoc staff from governors elected on the platform of the APC and other bigwigs within the ruling party while allegedly taking directives from the presidency to manipulate the electoral process in favour of President Muhammadu Buhari. Addressing a press conference yesterday in Abuja, the Director of Media and Publicity of the PDP Presidential Campaign Organisation, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, said failure of INEC to publish the list would clearly show it had compromised. Mr. Ologbondiyan explained that publishing the list would help the opposition and other stakeholders to hold INEC and the ruling party accountable in events leading to the elections. PDP also demanded international authorities to place the INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, INEC commissioners and other key staff of the commission on watch list in order to avert what he termed “avoidable crisis.” 2019: PDP gives INEC 48 hours to publish list of electoral officers PDP kicks against INEC guidelines on accreditation, voting 8 parties submit presidential, N/Assembly candidates - INEC
