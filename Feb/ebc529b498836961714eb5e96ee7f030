The Association of Nigerian Scholars in the Diaspora (ANSD) has challenged former President Olusegun Obasanjo to provide evidence on his reported claims of plots to rig the elections. The association also expressed disappointment at the postponement of the presidential and National Assembly elections five hours before balloting began last Saturday by the electoral umpire. The scholars said the postponement had caused severe hardships to many Nigerian voters and candidates, especially those who traveled down to exercise their franchise. A statement jointly signed by Prof. Bitrus Paul Gwamna, president and Prof. Pita Ogaba Agbese Secretary-General of the association, yesterday called on Nigerians to reject the alleged plot by former Obasanjo to discredit the forthcoming elections The scholars affirmed that Nigerians deserve a better leader like President Muhammadu Buhari, who have laid a better foundation for the next level. “Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has all but condemned the elections as already rigged in favor of President Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC). He has made this condemnation without a scintilla of evidence. “If Obasanjo’s statements on the elections were made from a non-partisan perspective, one could forgive him and say that his statements as misguided as they have been, were ill-advised but well-intentioned. That is not the case. “Obasanjo has been actively campaigning on behalf of Atiku Abubakar, one of the leading presidential candidates. In fact, Obasanjo’s zeal for the Atiku candidacy creates the impression that it is Obasanjo himself who is the candidate of the PDP. 2019: Nigeria scholars in Diaspora challenge Obasanjo over rigging allegation Polls shift: Association berates INEC, backs Buhari Jonathan to Obasanjo: Your allegations are senseless, irrational
