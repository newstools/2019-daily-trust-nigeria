The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) has directed all Distribution Companies (DisCos) to complete the enumeration of their customers by March 31, 2019. The Commission also urged all electricity consumers to cooperate with the DisCos in this exercise within the 42 day period that is left from today. In a publication directed at the DisCos, NERC said: “This is very important and it is in the interest of consumers as it would improve metering and help DisCos to respond to electricity issues quickly.” The Commission said the enumeration when completed will help to promote easy metering of existing and new customers, improve the accuracy of billing, and to improve the quality of supply and quicker fault response time. After the enumeration, NERC said the DisCos would now determine the unique Customer Identification Number (CIN) for every electricity customer in Nigeria. “The CIN will become a critical factor for identifying genuine customers in transactions with the DisCos,” it noted in the circular. Meanwhile, NERC Chairman, Prof. James Momoh has said about 44 large power consumers are ready to for the eligible customer scheme so they can get their power supply directly from Generation Companies (GenCos).
