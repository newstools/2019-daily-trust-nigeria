Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has denied any involvement in the All Progressives Congress (APC) disrupted rally at his Gbajimgba home town in Guma Local Government Area of the state. Ortom, who reacted to the Friday incident through his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Tahav Agerzua, also reiterated his commitment to peaceful elections in the state as he called on all stakeholders to eschew violence and any conduct that could cause a breakdown of law and order. He urged his supporters in particular to exercise restraint even in the face of extreme provocation and to report anyone who breaches the peace to law enforcement agents. The governor said it became necessary to reiterate his position, following accusations that he stopped the rally of an opposition party in Gbajimba. Ortom recalled that no one hindered the opposition from using the IBB Square in Makurdi, or disrupted their campaign flag off in Makurdi, which is the state capital, stressing that attempts to link him with a failed campaign effort in his local government area was baseless.
