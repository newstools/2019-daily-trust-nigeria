The Forum of All Political Parties in Akwa Ibom State is seeking the redeployment of the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Mr Mike Igini over alleged partisanship. Speaking on Tuesday in Uyo, Chairman of the forum, Mr Kingsley Akaiso of FRESH Party alleged that the REC has been compromised by the ruling People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the state and and would not be able to conduct free, fair and credible elections. Akaiso alleged that Igini has shown to be partisan in the selection of INEC ad hoc staff, said to be made up of loyal members and supporters of the PDP. “We have had cause in the immediate past to call attention to the failure of the INEC leadership in the state to inspire the confidence of all parties in the political process by reason of the actions of the Commission and the utterances of its leaders. “INEC has betrayed unbridled partisanship through the selection of its ad hoc staff, some of whom are drawn from the employees of the
Commission, contrary to extant practices and institutional requirements. “In spite of our representations to the Head Office of the Commission in Abuja, nothing has been done to allay our concern that the INEC
office in Akwa Ibom State is not a fair umpire and cannot deliver a free, fair and transparent election because it is partisan and in bed
with the ruling PDP government in the state. This anomaly must be addressed,” he said. However, the REC, Mr Mike Igini, has debunked the allegation, noting that  political parties should not be the ones to determine those to be recruited as ad hoc staff during elections. He stated that under his watch the commission would continue to remain apolitical, fair and unbiased and would provide equal opportunity to all political parties in the state. 2019 polls: Akwa Ibom APC seeks redeployment of REC PDP governors to DSS: Back off from electoral matters PDP governors to DSS: Back off from electoral matters
