The National Association of Nigerian Students, NANS, on Monday, suspended its planned nationwide protest over the postponement of the Presidential and National Assembly elections. The NANS Spokesperson, Azeez Adeyemi told newsmen in Abeokuta, Ogun State that the demonstration had been hijacked by unnamed politicians, hence the suspension. The Students’ body had threatened to embark on a nationwide protest today against the postponement of the elections by the Independent National Electoral Commission . He said: “I must say here, after going through all information in the public domain about the postponement of the presidential and national assembly elections, we have obviously seen that, there is hand of Esau and voice Jacob in the hullabaloo. “It is based on these premises we want to emphatically say that NANS is not a tool to settle political issue. We say with utmost sincerity and seriousness of mind that we are not coward and he who runs away from a fight lives to fight another day.” “Information from our intelligence has it that some criminals, sponsored by some enemies of our nation and human rights, have planned to hijack the voice of the people.” Calls for resignation of INEC chairman unfair-NANS Election postponement: INEC’s reasons not convincing, says Wadada Election postponement won’t stop APC’s victory, says Egbeyemi
