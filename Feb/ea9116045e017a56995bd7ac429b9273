Former President, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo on Saturday met leaders of top political parties and security chiefs in Ogun State over violence which has characterised campaigns in the state ahead of general elections. Daily Trust on Sunday recalls that no fewer than 10 supporters of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Allied Peoples Movement (APM) were injured and many campaign vehicles shattered when both parties clashed on Thursday in Abeokuta. Obasanjo, however, met the political parties’ leaders behind closed doors for more two hours at Owu Hall inside Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta on Saturday. Briefing newsmen shortly after the meeting, the State Chairman of Action Democratic Party (ADP), Chief Wale Egunleti said Obasanjo warned them to maintain peaceful campaign in the interest of all. Egunleti said “Our father (Obasanjo) has called the political parties for a meeting to shun any act of thuggery, fighting, and any form of violence during and after election. “We want to serve the people and we must lead by example. Therefore, we have been warned and advised to keep peace in Ogun for the benefit of all. “Also, we should maintain peace and ensure that we inform authorities about our plans and movement for security reasons.” He added that there would be subsequent meetings for review and monitor of compliance.
