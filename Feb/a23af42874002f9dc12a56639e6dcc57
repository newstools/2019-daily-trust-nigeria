Chairman, Independent National Elections Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu has said that the commission will investigate every campaign finance used by politicians and political parties if there is any form of violation. Speaking on Friday in Abuja when he visited the Headquarters of the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC), he told journalist that “there have actually been lots of comments on the issue of tradermoni, money being shared by the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osibanjo to traders, and people have insisted that it was a form of vote buying.” He said although people make comments which are partisan in nature and it was not for the commission to join issues with but “we will study all the comments we have heard from people and know if it is the type is issue we should be tracking.” He said that the commission has a mechanism for tracking campaign finances “but this doesn’t seem to fall in terms of campaign financing and in terms of expenditure by candidates and parties. He also assured that every measure has been put in place to ensure that no form of vote buying takes place during the elections. On his visit, Yakubu said the commission came to seek for partnership with the FRSC so that they could help track vehicles that will be used in conveying election materials from one area to another so that no driver will escape with the materials.  2019 election: Don advocates regulatory framework for tracking election campaign finance 2019: INEC to modify campaign finance monitoring Hope party sues INEC, APC over tradermoni
