Ahead of the Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections, security agencies on Wednesday stepped up surveillance at the Enugu State headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and its other offices in the state. Daily Trust reports that the heavy deployment of security personnel was as a result of the recent fire outbreaks in INEC offices in Abia, Anambra and Plateau states. When our correspondent visited the INEC headquarters in Enugu, he observed the arrival of a truck-load of about 30 well-kitted mobile policemen, at the INEC’s state office in Enugu. Similarly, Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC) mounted by five mobile policemen was also seen at the state headquarters. Also, Daily Trust observed increased number  of personnel of other  security agencies such as the Department of State Security and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) across the state. Commenting on the development, the Commandant of NSCDC in Enugu State, Mr Steve Amoga, said  the increased number of security personnel to INEC offices would ensure adequate security in all the commission’s offices in the state. According to Amoga, “Security agencies in the state have decided to provide additional personnel in all INEC offices both at the headquarters and council areas in the state. “We are now to provide 24/7 security to INEC office, its personnel as well as electoral materials. “It is a clear indication that we are out to support INEC to succeed as well as ensure that electoral materials are secured.” Heavy security mars picketing of EEDC in Enugu IGP assures INEC of adequate security for 2019 elections Multiple registrants should stay away – Jega
