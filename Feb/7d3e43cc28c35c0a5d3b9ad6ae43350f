A Federal High Court in Abuja has nullified the nomination of Sen. Ayogu Eze as the APC governorship candidate in Enugu State.  Justice Inyang Ekwo, on Tuesday, declared Barr. George Ogara as the governorship candidate of the APC in Enugu State. Justice Ekwo held that the primary that produced Ogara was in compliance with the party’s guidelines and the Elec-toral Act, and that he scored the highest votes in 270 wards of the 17 local government areas in the state. The judge also restrained INEC from accepting any other name except that of Ogara for the purpose of the 2019 governorship election in the state.
