The victory of Senator Dino Melaye at the Saturday’s National Assembly election against all odds must have come to many people as a big surprise. Embattled Senator Melaye of the PDP polled a total of 85,395 votes to defeat his main challenger, Smart Adeyemi of the APC who scored 66,902 votes. For Dino to have defeated Smart Adeyemi who many said enjoyed the backing of Governor Yahaya Bello was no mean feat. The APC clinched Kogi Central Senate seat and was on the verge of clinching Kogi East but Melaye was able to retain his seat under PDP platform. Observers, however, believed that the victory of Senator Melaye was largely a result of the overwhelming support and goodwill he enjoys from his people. Compared to the other two senators from the state, Melaye stands tall in terms of attracting constituency projects to the people of Kogi especially his constituents. He is also viewed as “a hero and voice for the voiceless” especially amongst the youth, for “his courage in speaking the truth to those in power” not minding the consequences. Sometime last year, there was an aggressive move to recall Senator Melaye allegedly by some external forces but the move failed woefully as his people stood solidly behind him by refusing to turnout to participate in the recall exercise. According to pundits, Dino’s kinsmen, the Okuns who are spread across five LGAs as well as his loyalists in Lokoja and Kogi and KotonKarfe LGAs, decided to throw their support  given the travails he had gone through. Apart from that, the role of the likes of Senator Tunde Ogbeha was said to be very crucial in Saturday’s victory of Senator Dino Melaye at the poll.
