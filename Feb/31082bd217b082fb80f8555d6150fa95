The ABS Mandate Constituency Office of the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, has commenced distribution of cash gifts to the victims of recent political violence at his Agbaji, Ilorin country home. The constituency office in collaboration with Agbaji Development Association has so far disbursed N15 million out of the N25 million approved as palliatives for the victims by the Senate President. Over 50 vehicles were damaged while some motorcycles were carted away when suspected political thugs attacked the people of Agbaji quarters. The money was deposited with Ajikobi Microfinance Bank which later disbursed it to the victims upon presentation of cheques issued by the Agbaji Development Association (ADA). The Director General of the ABS Mandate Constituency Office, Ilorin, Musa Abdullahi who released the money to ADA’s committee on the victims of the violent attack, said the balance of N10 million would be disbursed at a later date. He said the Senate President was deeply touched by the unprovoked attacks on his kinsmen and wanton destruction of their property by the suspected APC thugs.
