Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State has described the postponement of the general elections as a suspension of the right of the Nigerian citizens to execute their franchise of electing leaders of their choice. He said that the development questioned the capacity and sincerity of the APC -run Federal Government to deliver a true democratic process for the nation. The Governor however, expressed appreciation for the support and solidarity of all the people in Sokoto State and appealed to them for patience and calm. He enjoined them to remain steadfast in the pursuit of democracy and commitment to the electoral process. Tambuwal called on INEC to compensate the citizens for the hitch by ensuring free and fair elections for the restoration of the people’s trust and confidence.
