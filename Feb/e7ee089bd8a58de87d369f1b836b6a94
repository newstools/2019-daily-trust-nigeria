The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has appealed to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to ensure that every vote count. The Director of Media and Publicity of the PDP Presidential Campaign Organisation, Kola Ologbondiyan in a statement however accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) of killing innocent Nigerians and burning ballot boxes in Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections. “The unleashing of violence is the major part of the script by the APC to intimidate Nigerians and disrupt the election, in their bid to enforce the now failed President Buhari’s self-succession plot. “President Buhari and the APC leadership must know that they are directly responsible for the killings in Rivers state, the violent snatching of ballot box and burning of electoral materials in Lagos and various other states where compromised security agents were used to directly interfere in the electoral process. “Our party is compiling a list of all infractions and the killings as well as securing the identities of all individuals who played roles in these the atrocities. “The PDP therefore call on INEC to ensure that all votes count as Nigerians are following all the figures from the polling units.  Having come thus far and after making huge sacrifices, Nigerians will never accept any result that does not reflect the reality of their already expressed wishes and aspiration at the polls,” he said.
