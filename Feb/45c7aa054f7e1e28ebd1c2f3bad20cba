The Department of State Services (DSS) yesterday invited INEC National Commissioner in charge of logistics Professor Okechukwu Ibeanu, along with other officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as part of investigation of the botched February 16 general elections. Daily Trust gathered yesterday that Ibeanu was asked to report at the DSS head office in Abuja at 2 pm yesterday. Also invited by the DSS were Chidi Nwafor, the director of ICT; Ken Ukeagu, director of procurement; Osaze Uzzi, director of voter education and publicity; and Bimbo Oladunjoye, the assistant director of ICT. However, the invitations were stood down yesterday after news of the investigation went public, Daily Trust has gathered. A source said the timing of the invitation was too close to the rescheduled election date and may have a negative effect on INEC’s preparations for the election. When contacted, the spokesman of the DSS, Peter Afunanya told Daily Trust that he was out of office on assignment and could not respond at the time.
