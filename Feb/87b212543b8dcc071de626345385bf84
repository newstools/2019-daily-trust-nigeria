The Assets Management Company of Nigeria (AMCON) has dispel reports in some sections of the media that Nigerian Braiding Manufacturers Limited (NBML), a Kano State-based textile company, has been shut down. NBML was recently taken over by AMCON as a result of its Non-Performing Loans (NPL) purchased from banks by the government agency. In a statement signed by AMCONâ€™s Head of Corporate Communications, Mr. Jude Nwauzor, the corporation confirmed that in line with the provisions of AMCON Act 2010 (as amended), the corporation approached the court and secured an order enabling it to take possession of the company through its Receiver Manager, Dr. Yakubu Fobur, under whose supervision the company is billed to resume full production soon. In contrast to the rumours, AMCON was set up to facilitate resolution of NPLs in the banking industry with a view to stabilising the economy. As such, the corporation is dedicated to ensuring that the company remains in operation under the management of the receiver manager and his team of experts who are expected to work closely with the promoters of the company to ensure that NBML returns to profitability within a short period.
