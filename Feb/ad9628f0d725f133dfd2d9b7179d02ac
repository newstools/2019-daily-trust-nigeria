Ahead of President Muhammadu Buhari’s visit to Kwara state for the APC presidential campaign rally, the Buhari Campaign Organisation has started mobilising and sensitising the electorates to warmly receive the president. The patron of the organisation, Alhaji Yakubu Gobir, who led the team said they are doing that to sensitise Kwarans on the planned visit of Buhari to the state next Tuesday. The team who began the sensitisation on Wednesday visited some parts of Kwara Central senatorial district where they met with party members who shown their readiness to give the president a befitting welcome. According to Gobir, “We embarked on the visit to some of our wards to thank our people who came during the commissioning of the APC new secretariat, to mobilise them for the president’s visit and also to talk to them on what it is expected of them during the election. Gobi,r who was a gubernatorial aspirant, said since he lost during the primary election, he is ready to work for the victory of the party. He added that, “I am happy today because I came home to the change the status quo. Although, I have been a member of the party for a long time but sponsoring younger ones all the while. When I decided to contest I could get the ticket but since I lost, I have decided to support the party to bring the desire change to our state. “Some have relaxed because they lost and since I am praying for liberation of Kwara, that is why I came back to work. I therefore appeal to our members to shelve their swords and work for the APC because once APC wins, thing will change for better for all of us. He urged the youth not to engage in violence but work to win other youths from other parties to the APC. Apart from the party’s provision for mobilisation of the people, Gobir also promises to support them for mobilisation to the venue of the campaign. 2019 campaigns: Story behind ‘mammoth’ crowds 2019 Campaigns Heat Up How APC presidential campaign flag-off shook Rivers
