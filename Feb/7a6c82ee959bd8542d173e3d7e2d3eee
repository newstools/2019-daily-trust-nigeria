Students and parents have offered prayers amidst tears and grief to commemorate one year of continued abduction of Leah Sheribu by her abductors, in Dapchi town of Yobe State. In February 19, 2018, gunmen invaded Government Girls Science and Technical Collage, Dapchi and abducted 105 schoolgirls. They later returned 104 to their parents and held Leah for refusing to denounced her faith. At Leah’s family house in Dapchi, both Christian and Muslim prayers were offered by a pastor and Imam, seeking God’s intervention for her safe and unconditional release. The mother, who was represented at the prayer sessions by Leah’s Aunt, Hyelakumi Manasseh, said she would continue to wait forever until her daughter returned. Leah’s mother, who was away at Adamawa State, urged the federal government to fulfill its promise and ensure that her daughter is set free.
