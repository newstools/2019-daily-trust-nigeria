As at 9:16am, voters were still stranded at the Hotoro Limawa polling station in Kano metropolis. Voters eager to exercise their franchise besieged the polling station as early as 6:30 am for the Presidential and National Assembly elections. Our reporters observed that as at 9:20am, neither INEC ad hoc staff nor election materials were brought to the polling station. The voters have been sitting in queues hopelessly. According to one of the voters, Ismail Suleiman, the voters started converging since 6am but have not seen any INEC official. “Since 6am we have been here hopelessly because we are yet to see any INEC official and no explanation was given as regards to the delay,” Suleiman said. At Yargaya Ward in Dawakin Kudu LGA, INEC officials and voting materials arrived at 9:32am. One of the police officers who escorted the materials told our reporters that the delay emanated from the LG INEC office as only one officer was responsible for the distribution of materials.
