The APC has promised to take punitive measures against sponsors of a presidential rally violence in Ogun State after the general elections. The APC National Publicity Secretary, Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, in a statement yesterday, said the party regretted Monday’s alleged premeditated attacks on President Muhammadu Buhari and other senior party leaders purportedly sponsored by Gov. Ibikunle Amosun at the venue of the presidential campaign rally in the state. Malam Issa-Onilu, who said the party would review the “gross misconduct”, added that party supremacy and discipline were not matters of choice but binding principles which must be adhered to by all party members. The APC spokesman, who urged party supporters and members not to be disturbed by the “condemnable” incident, implored all to continue trooping out en masse for the remaining campaigns and vote massively for all and only APC candidates in the general elections. “This is one act of indiscipline too many. The APC will not condone acts of indiscipline, indiscretion and anti-party activities from any party member no matter how highly placed. “The party will review this gross misconduct of deliberately positioning thugs to attack and embarrass the president and the party’s leadership. The party will take a decision on this matter immediately after the elections,” he said.
