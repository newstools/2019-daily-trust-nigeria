National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole has said that the Senate President, Bukola Saraki has been buried politically. Saraki who has been representing Kwara Central Senatorial District since 2011, was defeated last Saturday by Dr. Ibrahim Oloriegbe of the APC. Speaking to State House Correspondents on Wednesday, he said while they were talking of impeachment, Saraki’s constituents buried him politically last Saturday. In an apparent reference to Saraki, Oshiomhole, said: ” People who came to the senate with less than a 100,000 votes, and began to hold the country to ransom, their own people have recalled them home. ” While we were saying that we will impeach them, their people said they would rather bury them. Politically, now, they are out. It shows the power of democracy, it’s a leveler, an equalizer, you cannot be bigger than the people. ” Our people say that a politician is like an Okoro tree, he should never grow taller than the person who planted it. And those who plant the political okoro tree, are the Nigerian people.” Enumerating the lessons learnt from Saturday’s elections, Oshiomhole said:  “I think, a couple of lessons have been learnt, this game is for those who are humble, those who believe in the people. ” There are no dynasties, the people are the sovereign, when they borrow you the power, remember, it is only lend to you, and it will expire, and it will require renewal. If you don’t behave, they will remove you.” He expressed happiness that Nigerians have renewed overwhelmingly the mandate of president Buhari. ” If you look at the numbers, you will see that the President has more votes. This time, the difference between the President and the runner up, is that he has more votes than before,” he said.
