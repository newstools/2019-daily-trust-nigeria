Three persons have been killed in Benin, the Edo State capital, in a renewed fight between rival cult groups in the state. It was gathered that the victims, whose identity could not be ascertained, were killed at Upper Sakpoba area of Benin in what seem to be a reprisal attack. In one of the attacks, a man – simply identified as Africa – was said to have been killed on Tuesday morning at his beer parlor, located at Uyiosa Junction, Upper Sakponba. It was gathered that his assailants dragged him out of his beer parlor and shot at him severally but when they discovered that bullets could not penetrate him, they allegedly used machete and axe on him. It was further gathered that two other victims were killed at about 2pm, still in Upper Sakpoba, with a battle axe. The bodies of the victims have been deposited at the Benin Specialist Hospital by the Police. It was gathered that the cult war stated on Saturday and has so far claimed five persons. It would be recalled that a hotel manager, Okunkpolor Osatohamwen, was also murdered at his place of work on Sunday by yet to be identified gunmen. When contacted on phone, the Edo state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Hakeem Odumosu, said he was in Kano on election duty. The State Police public relations officer, Chidi Nwabuzor, could not be reached for confirmation, as calls made to his mobile phone were not answered.
