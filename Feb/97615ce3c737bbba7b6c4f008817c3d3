Farmer and bull dealer Wang Shiyouhe bought the calf, which is just over a week old, after one of his friends brought it to his attention. Shiyouhe, who is from the village of Henan in East China’s Shandong province, said he had never seen a birth defect like this on a calf in more than a decade in the business. Wang decided to purchase the calf for himself because of its uniqueness.  He now spends nearly £6 a day on milk for the adorable animal and he plans to raise it to maturity despite the physical deformity. While the calf may look like a kangaroo because of its two legs, Wang says it is still unable to walk and he will have to teach it how. Wang added: “It is strong, and I will keep it for as long as it lives.” The calf has also become the talk of the town in Wang’s village, with locals visiting to take a look at the unusual young bull. His children also appear to have taken a liking to the animal and help bottle-feed it in the barn. Culled from dailystar.co.uk  ‘And the rams went on hunger strike’!
