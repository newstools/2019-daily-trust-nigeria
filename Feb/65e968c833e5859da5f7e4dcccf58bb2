United Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc has collaborated with Google, an ISP partner, to launch Google Station in 11 key UBA branches in Lagos State as part of plans to roll out 200 stations in the country. Google Station, a platform for providing free, high-speed Wi-Fi hotspots in public places, began in Lagos last year, and extended to Abuja in December in partnership with Backbone Connectivity Network. This google-powered initiative would allow customers access to internet connectivity within the 11 branches and its environs, thereby facilitating their day-to-day businesses and activities, while ensuring unhindered connectivity. At the official launch which took place in UBA’s Head Office on Wednesday, UBA’s Executive Director/Group Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Chuks Nweke, expressed UBA’s excitement over the collaboration, adding that the move will go a long way to present opportunities far beyond the imagination of both organisations. He noted that the challenges of financial inclusion which the USSD platform has not been able to solve will be eased through the Google Station, as the financially excluded will now be able to access the internet and enjoy the services provided free of charge. Google Nigeria’s Country Director, Juliet Ehimuan-Chiazor, noted that the institutions remained focused on providing internet services to users for free.
