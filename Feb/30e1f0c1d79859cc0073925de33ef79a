Kwara state APC governorship candidate, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, on Tuesday said the appellate court’s judgement affirming his candidature was a victory for the people of the state. The media aide to Abdulrazak, Rafiuaye Ajakaye, said in a statement that the ruling confirmed his position that the earlier judgement of the High Court was in “bad faith and cannot stand any legal scrutiny.” The statement reads: “This judgement on our interlocutory appeal has cleared the final logjam the discredited dynasty, acting through their proxies, was using to stall our people’s steady move to political liberation and socio-economic progress. “On behalf of all the Kwara APC candidates in the coming elections, we thank the people of Kwara state for their solidarity while the legal distractions lasted. The ruling is a victory for the masses of Kwara who yearn for change, political freedom and a government that is truly committed to their welfare. “Finally, we thank our lawyers for their doggedness, brilliant submissions and perseverance in the diligent prosecution of the appeal. “We are very grateful to the Comrade Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee (NWC) of our great party and all our national and state leaders for putting their feet down that Kwara must be free from political predators.” AbdulRazaq wants ICC to monitor Kwara polls 2 APC factions present at INEC peace accord meeting Kwara by-election victory: Brighter days ahead — Abdulrazaq
