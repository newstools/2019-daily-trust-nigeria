The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said special provision has been made to give priority to persons with disability and pregnant women to have a separate raw during the 2019 general elections. Speaking yesterday during INECâ€™s zonal implementation meeting on gender and the 2019 general elections held in Kano, the Resident Electoral Commissioner in the state (REC), Prof. Riskuwa Arabu Shehu, said during the 2015 general elections, only two rows were used: male and female. Prof. Shehu said ahead of the forthcoming elections, an additional row for people with disability and pregnant women would be provided. The REC, represented by the spokesman of the commission in Kano, Malam Garba Lawan Muhammad, said the meeting was aimed at sensitising women, civil society groups and people with disability on their role in ensuring free, credible and fair elections.
