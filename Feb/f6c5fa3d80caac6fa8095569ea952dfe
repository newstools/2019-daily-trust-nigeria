The Education Secretary of Bwari Area Council, Solomon Ayuba Dagami, has said 99 per cent of teachers are happy with the administration of Musa Dikko because of the way he has handled their issues. He said the chairman was responsible for the face-lift of schools in the council, providing infrastructure and instructional materials. He said the council chairman “is a visionary and a composed leader who pursues things with vigour. He has a passion for staff welfare, to the extent that when he came on board, with the little resources, he settled teachers’ arrears and always ensures prompt payment of salaries.” He said with the development, there is no doubt that teachers in the council would support the re-election bid of the president and the council chairman.
