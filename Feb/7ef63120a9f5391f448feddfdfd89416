Iyan Sokoto, Alhaji Aminu Dodo Iya has dismissed rumours that some of the family members have defected to the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). “We, the members of this well respected, disciplined and highly cultured family are hereby distancing ourselves, in totality, from such dastardly and destructive rumour. It was indeed the handiwork of some merchants of grapevine, bent on soiling the good name of the family,” he said in a statement. He added:” The crux of this statement is that, none of us had at a time pitched his or her camp with the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), a Club being misled and misguided by some failed, deluded and expired politicians.” Iyan Sokoto stressed: ” Let no any purveyor of rumour and enemies of progress again, ever link any of our family members with the woeful PDP.  In APC we stay and in it we shall ever remain.” He added: ” Consequently, we are hereby strongly and unequivocally reiterating our love, support and respect for the leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), in Sokoto state. He is no other person than the nation’s political sage, a trail blazer, a pacesetter and a former indefatigable Governor of Sokoto State, Senator Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko, the Sarkin Yamman Sokoto.” While commending all those who called to verify the situation, he said the family of the late Alhaji Muhammadu Dodo Iya, would sustain their current fervent prayers and all efforts to see to the success of the candidates of the APC, at all levels, during the forthcoming rescheduled 2019 polls. Former CPC's executives deny leaving APC, says Yabo never supported Buhari PDP Reps to await court on Tambuwal As Tambuwal jumps ship
