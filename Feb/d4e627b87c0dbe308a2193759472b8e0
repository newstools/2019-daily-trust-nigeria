The Chairman of the Edo state chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Dan Orbih, has called on the Chairman of Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Mahmood Yakubu to resign from his duty, following the postponement of the Presidential and National Assembly election. Orbih, who stated this on Saturday while reacting to the postponement, described it as a monumental embarrassment to the nation. He said: “INEC, conscious of its constitutional responsibility, knows that it has four years to prepare for the election. After four years, they called off the election that they assured Nigerians that they were prepared for in the last minute at about 2:30am. It is shameful and disappointing,” “I joined other patriotic Nigerians to called on INEC chairman and his national commissioners to take responsibility for the failure and resign,” he said. 2015 Elections: The Forces Against Jega Polls postponement: Reps demand resignation of service chiefs Movement demand investigation of Ekiti 'leaked audio'
