The FCT chapter of the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) has endorsed President Muhammadu Buhari for a second term. FCT Chairman of RIFAN, Alhaji Abubakar Dahiru Zuba, while addressing newsmen in Gwagwalada yesterday, said the decision of the association to endorse the re-election of Buhari was informed by the performance of the president in the agricultural sector. Alhaji Zuba said rice farmers in the FCT had felt the impact of the APC-led administration’s agricultural policies, which he said, prompted the association to endorse Buhari for another term. He said the FCT rice farmers were part of the administration’s Anchor Borrower Programme (ABP), adding that farm inputs were recently distributed to them across the six area councils for dry season farming. “Buhari’s priority attention to agriculture has reduced importation of rice and we the local rice farmers are now feeling the impact,” he said. Zuba also commended the FCT Minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, for his support to rural farmers in the FCT.  14,000 FCT rice farmers to receive inputs  – RIFAN CBN approves compensation for 550,000 rice farmers affected by flood Niger state is largest rice producer — RIFAN chairman
