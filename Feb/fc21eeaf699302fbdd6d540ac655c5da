The representatives of Yemen’s warring parties have met on a ship in the Red Sea to discuss the stalled truce agreement for the contested port city of Hodeidah. Retired Dutch General Patrick Cammaert chaired the meeting on board a United Nations’ vessel off the Yemeni coast on Sunday after the Houthi rebels refused to hold talks in government-held areas, an official told the AFP news agency on condition of anonymity. A Saudi-UAE coalition of forces has been fighting Houthi rebels for control of the country since 2014. As the negotiations took place, reports emerged that the deputy chief of staff of the Saudi-backed Yemeni government died from wounds sustained last month in a drone attack by Houthis on the country’s largest airbase, Al Anad, while a military parade was under way.
