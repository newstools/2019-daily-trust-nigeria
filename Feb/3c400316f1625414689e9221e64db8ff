Sequel to the success recorded with the coming on stream of the 200,000 barrels per day capacity Egina deepwater oilfield, Total Upstream says it has put forward for approval to the Federal Government, Field Development Plan (FDP) for the 50,000 bpd Preowei oil field. Located on Oil Mining Lease (OML) 130, about 25 kilometers North of Egina field with water depth of 1150 meters, Total said the company is set to progress to Front End Engineering Design (FEED) studies immediately it secured  government’s approval and then take Final Investment Decision (FID) on the project. Total Upstream, it would be recalled, had on December 29, 2018, announced that its $16 billion Egina deepwater oilfield had achieved first oil production, helping to push Nigeria’s oil output beyond 2.09 million barrels per day in December. Speaking at the just concluded Nigerian International Petroleum Summit (NIPS) in Abuja, Total Exploration and Production Nigeria, Deputy Managing Director, Mr. Ahmadu-Kida Musa, said series of appraisals of well drilled had confirmed oil reserve in the new field, stressing that, Total will integrate all the lessons learnt in Egina into the development of the field. Initially discovered in 2003, Egina field is the second development in production on the Oil Mining Lease 130 following the Akpo field, which started  in 2009. “The Preowei field is another large discovery made on this prolific block for which an investment decision is scheduled for 2019.We have learnt a lot from Egina especially as it concerned local contents and all our projects are going to be based on that model. “We do accept the fact that we should be able to do more and in that philosophy, we are commencing work on projects like Preowei field which is a subside tie-back to Egina and we are working on the FDP. “All the lessons learnt in Egina will be integrated,” Musa stated.
