At least 16 civilians, including seven children, were killed in air attacks launched by a US-backed coalition aiming to capture ISIL’s last enclave in eastern Syria. Fighter jets fired missiles in support of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in Baghouz, a village in Deir Az Zor province, as part of a fierce battle to seize Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant’s last sliver of territory in the region. SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said heavy clashes were ongoing on Tuesday after hundreds fled the battle zone overnight. An estimated 600 ISIL fighters remain in a 4-square-kilometre area near the Iraqi border on the eastern banks of the Euphrates River. Many of them foreigners, most are expected to fight to the death. The SDF announced a final push to retake Baghouz late on Saturday. Since then some military advances have been made, but ISIL snipers and landmines have slowed the ground forces down.
