The APC has called on Nigerians, party members and supporters to pray for peace and the success of tomorrow’s elections. The APC National Publicity Secretary, Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, who made the call yesterday, also cautioned all Nigerians and party members not to be involved in any act of electoral malpractice and irregularities. Issa-Onilu said, “We should stay safe and work collectively to ensure that the general elections are free, fair, transparent and credible. “We caution Nigerians, and all involved in the electoral process not to be influenced by huge money the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is moving around to buy votes with and compromise the system. “Our future should not be mortgaged to the leaders of PDP who are using our common wealth that they stole for over 16 years to seek a return to power,” he said.
