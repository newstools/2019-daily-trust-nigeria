The Nigerian Defence Industries Corporation (DICON) through the Ministry of Defence (MOD) has entered into a Public-Private Partnership with Sur Corporate Wares of the Republic of Turkey. The partnership is expected to bring an estimated N4 billion investment by Sur Corporate Wares in the establishment of a military and paramilitary clothing and accessories factory to be set up in Kaduna state. This was hinted yesterday in Abuja when the Minister of Defence, Mansur Dan-Ali was presented the Full Business Case (FBC) Compliance Certificate by the Director General of Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) Chidi Izuwa. Dan-Ali noted that, “over the years, it is regrettable that Nigeria has relied heavily on importation of not only military hard wears and ammunitions but also clothing and accessories.” He said the government is committed to the task of establishing a functional Military Industrial Complex that will provide indigenous support for adequate kitting and equipping of the Armed Forces. He said, “The issuance of the Full Business Case Compliance Certificate for this project has lent credence to the potential of the project to herald the revival of a once thriving sector in Nigeria.” He said once completed, the venture is expected to sufficiently meet the accoutrement needs of the Armed Forces of Nigeria and other uniformed Paramilitary organizations. He said, “This will further help in creating direct and indirect job opportunities for the teeming youth in the country as well as conserving our foreign exchange.” Sur Corporate Wares has agreed to build the factory and provide equipment for production on a site made available on the premises of DICON in Kaduna.
