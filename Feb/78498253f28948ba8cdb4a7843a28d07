A civil society group, Save Humanity Advocacy Centre, SHAC, has berated the recent report by Amnesty International that 60 persons were killed by Boko Haram sect in Rann, Borno state. The group alleged that the report was contrived by AI to diminish the efforts of the Federal Government as a failed state whilst dampening the moral of troops to confer advantage on the fleeing elements of Boko Haram. SHAC in a statement on Saturday by Adams Odoh, Executive Director,  Intelligence and Investigation Bureau, urged the Federal Government to expel AI from the country. “We all have Amnesty International to thank for alerting the world to the reported killing of 60 persons in Boko Haram’s attack on Rann, Borno state, the international NGO tried its best to romanticise. This latest development in which Amnesty International has turned itself into a tale bearer for publicising Boko Haram’s attack is a new dimension that should leave all genuine stakeholders worried for the simple fact that it is a dangerous turn of events, which is wrong on all levels. “You may wish to note that Boko Haram’s propaganda infrastructure suffered some measure of decline as the media in Nigeria has increasingly become aware of the dangers of helping the terrorists to promote instances in which they carry out attacks The group added that the military authorities have asserted that there was no attack in Rann.
