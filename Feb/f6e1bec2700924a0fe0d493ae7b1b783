The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, has alleged that President Muhammadu Buhari, and the All Progressives Congress (APC) are importing foreigners from Niger and Chad Republics to rig the presidential election on February 16. Atiku who stated this in Benin during the party presidential campaign rally in Benin urged party members to protect their votes by not allowing  rigging. “You have seen how they are bringing people from the neighbouring countries of  Niger and Chad. They want to use them to rig the February 16 election, they are come into your country and turn you to slave, so you should not allow it,” he said. “I appeal to you to vote for  PDP and after voting, you should stay there till they count the votes because if you leave, they will cheat you and  rig the election and if you allow them, they are rigging your future,” he said. He assured that 70 percent of his cabinet if elected would be young men and women, saying that he is the bridge between the old generation and younger generation “If you look at the registered today, 70 percent are young men and young women and this means that we have to prepare you to take over leadership of this country and also have a meaningful carrier so that you will succeed in whatever you want to do,” he said According to him, APC has already destroyed the country as this is the first time we are having 31 million people out of job. “We are not like APC,  you know what the PDP has done for this country, when we came in 1999, oil was $11 and we save money to pay our debt,  brought GSM technology and everything to this country. We want to continue on that part of prosperity, so you must vote for us,” On his part, the PDP national chairman Uche Scondus, warned the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) not to use the Internally Displaced Persons to rig the election. According to him,  if the presidential election is rigged there would be chaos in the country, urging party faithful to be vigilant. 16 February polls: Disqualify Buhari now, PDP ask INEC Atiku, Secondus to electorate in Nasarawa: PDP will crush Boko Haram, end unemployment 2019: Don't plunge Nigeria into chaos with rigging, Secondus warns INEC, IGP
