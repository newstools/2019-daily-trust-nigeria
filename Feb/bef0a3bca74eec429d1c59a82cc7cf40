The Aidonogie of South Ibe Kingdom in Etsako West Local Government of Edo State, Alhaji Aliyu Kelvin Danesi, Oba Idanesi II, has urged Nigerians to reason with INEC over the postponement of the presidential and National Assembly elections to February 23. Oba Danesi who made the call on Sunday in a telephone interview with our reporter, said INEC must have genuine reason for postponing the election. He said as an independent body saddled with the responsibility of conducting election, Nigerians should cooperate with INEC to give the best. “INEC cannot just shift election for the fun of it. I believe  they have a genuine reason which I think they have advanced; they may have other reasons not mentioned due to security reasons but I am sure they reviewed the situation carefully and discovered that shifting the election was the solution and  would enable them to deliver credible, free fair and peaceful election,” he said.
