Quantity surveyors in Nigeria have commended the federal government on the new Executive Order 007 focusing on road infrastructure development and refurbishment investment tax credit scheme. While addressing journalists in Lagos, the President of the Nigerian Institute of Quantity Surveyors (NIGS), Obafemi Oluwole Onashile also cautioned the federal government on factors capable of frustrating the new fiscal policy, Order No 007. He said the new principle marked the first time a government in Africa will look into providing capital projects through the use of fiscal policy such as tax breaks. He noted that the usual method of government direct funding or lease-concession arrangement (PPP) through the private sector have both failed woefully, hoping that the new model by the Order No 007 would bring a better experience. “The NIQS comprising, of members who are financial, contractual and administrative experts in engineering infrastructure and construction projects identifies with this new and innovative projects delivery method.” While he noted that the Order has the Minister of Finance as the arrowhead to drive the policy, the NIQS President pledged the supports of member of the body in ensuring that the model succeeds and becomes a good example. Meanwhile, Onashile hinted that as laudable as the policy, it could still fail if not well managed. page 43 Corruption is high in civil works – Surveyors president Infrastructure: Surveyors urge non-reliance on oil
