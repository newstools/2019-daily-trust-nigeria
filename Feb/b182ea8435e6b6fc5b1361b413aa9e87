Islamic State is on its last legs in Eastern Syria where the extremist group is the target of an onslaught in its last bastion in the energy-rich area, a war monitor reported on Thursday. On Saturday, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led militia allied with the U.S., started an offensive to expel Islamic State from the village of Baghuz, the only area still under its control in the Eastern province of Deir al-Zour. According to Rami Abdel- Rahman, the head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Daesh (Islamic State) is breathing its last in the area with its elements now hiding among civilians for protection. “They are now confined to camps in the farmland located on the Eastern banks of the Euphrates River,’’ Abdel-Rahman told dpa. An SDF commander, who goes by the name Adnan Afrin, said the Islamic State remnants seem determined to resist until the end. “In the past few days, Daesh has used women fighters as suicide bombers against our advancing forces in order to delay our moves,’’ Afrin said. According to the observatory, SDF forces have been supported in their push against Islamic State by intense airstrikes from a U.S.-led coalition. The radical group still has foothold in the Syrian desert North of the city of al-Sukhna, around 50 kilometres from neighbouring Deir al-Zour. Syria’s Kurds have played a major role in fighting Islamic State and seized much of the territory that was under its control in war-torn Syria.
