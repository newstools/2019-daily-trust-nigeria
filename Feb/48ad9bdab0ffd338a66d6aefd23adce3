The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC in Kwara state, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, has urged the International Criminal Court  (ICC) to focus attention on the state where he alleged there is an ongoing attempts to unleash violence on the opposition. In a statement he issued in Ilorin on Thursday, the state capital, AbdulRazaq commended the ICC for its latest message warning against  violence in the coming polls. “We welcome the latest appeal and warnings by the International Criminal Court (ICC) on the upcoming Nigerian elections. There is need to pay attention to political development in the state. “We believe elections should not be a do or die affair but should be about selling one’s ideas to the electorate in an atmosphere devoid of violence or threat of same or intimidation. “We have reasons to call on the ICC to especially turn its radar on Kwara State where the discredited political dynasty has consistently used violence to suppress opposition. The recent rise in political violence, including attacks on my person and supporters and unabated destruction of our billboards, is instructive. “We therefore invite the ICC to monitor the processes leading to the elections in Kwara State. My supporters and I hereby formally pledge peaceful campaign and conduct before, during and after the elections. We urge the people of Kwara to shun violence in all forms and discourage our youths from violence or anything that could disturb public peace.” Abdulrazak said.
