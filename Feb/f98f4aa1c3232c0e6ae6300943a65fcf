The Federal High Court sitting in Enugu, yesterday, voided the nomination of Prince Lawrence Eze as Enugu East Senatorial candidate of the APC. The court presided over by Justice Ibrahim Buba held that Eze was not the validly nominated candidate of the party. In the suit she filed, Mrs. Adaku Ogbu-Aguocha contended that having won the party’s primary election, she was the right candidate of the party but that her name was wrongfully substituted. Ogbu-Aguocha said the fact that Mrs. Uche Ezemba stepped down after winning the primary,  the lot fell on her (Aguocha) as the 2nd runner up in the election. She provided evidence before the court that Eze was not even a member of the party at the time the primary election was conducted. Justice Buba in his judgement, agreed with the plaintiff and held that it was a case of ‘monkey dey work, baboon dey chop’. The court lambasted the defendant, Eze, for laying claim to what never belonged to him. Justice Buba said there was overwhelming evidence that Eze was still a member of PDP where he also contested during the senatorial primary election. He, therefore, ordered that Mrs. Ogbu-Aguocha should be recognized by the APC and INEC as the rightful candidate for Saturday election.
