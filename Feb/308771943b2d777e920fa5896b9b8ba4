A former President, Olusegun Obasanjo, has vowed to “do everything humanly possible to ensure the success of democracy in Nigeria.” Obasanjo stated this yesterday during the presentation of a book titled: Politics as Dashed Hopes in Nigeria, authored by Dr. Auwalu Anwar. The book was launched at the Shehu Musa Yar’Adua Centre in Abuja where many dignitaries attended. In his presentation, the former president said, “I would continue to do everything humanly possible to ensure the success of democracy in Nigeria. “Works of art like this help to document history and factorise issues that matter in the society.” He also urged Nigerians not to lose hope in the Nigerian Project, especially with issues related to the entrenchment of democratic norms and ideals. Keynote speaker, Dr. Usman Bugaje, berated politicians who he accused of excessive materialism and primitive acquisition of property to the detriment of the governed. In his remarks, PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, represented by a former Kano State Governor, Rabiu Kwankwaso, said the book marked a major milestone in the development of Nigeria’s constitutional democracy. The author, Dr. Auwalu Anwar, said the book was a critical commentary on Nigeria’s political scene and the politicians who had shaped it, especially the “sanctimonious integrity” of President Muhammadu Buhari, from the days of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC).
