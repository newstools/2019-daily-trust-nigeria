The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) has repaired and energised a 150MVA 330/132kV transformer in Kumbotso transmission substation in Kano state, five years after it was burnt. The spokesperson for the company, Ndidi Mbah on Thursday said it was the first time TCN in-house engineers successfully undertook such repair work, particularly for a badly burnt 150MVA capacity transformer. In a statement, she said the equipment has been put to service delivering more bulk electricity to Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDC). “It is also an indication of the growing capacity of its engineers under the present administration,” she noted. The substation had four units of 150MVA transformers but five years ago, one of them was burnt and considered irreparable. Another transformer tripped on January 1, 2019 and fixing it requires it would be transferred to a repair factory in Lagos. To ensure uninterrupted power supply from the substation to Kano DisCo load centres, TCN first re-arranged load from the tripped transformer into the two working units of 150MVA transformers and then commenced work on the burnt 150MVA transformer on January 2, 2019. The repair was completed and the burnt transformer was re-energized on the February 2, 2019. “With the successful repair of the 150MVA transformer, the capacity of the substation has been restored to three units of 150MVA transformers,” TCN noted. The company said it has mobilized a new 150MVA transformer from Lagos port to be delivered to Kumbotso substation. It further said: “TCN plans to install the transformer immediately it gets to the substation, however, TCN can now supply normal bulk power to Dakata Transmission substation and Kano distribution load centres taking supply from this substation to Katsina, Kankia and environs.” Failed transformer: TCN sustains electricity supply to Kano, after 90MW loss TCN restores electricity after Kano transformer fire TCN sustains 30mw power supply in Jos, others
