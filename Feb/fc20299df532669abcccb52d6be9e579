A day after Eko Trust reported the case of a 15-year-old boy, Farouk Adeniji, who was abandoned by his mother and had resorted to scavenging on dump sites and dirty streets in Ibadan to survive, a philanthropist called in pledging to adopt him. Eko Trust had last week reported that Adeniji lost his father when he was only five years old and his mother, whose named he called Nike, who thereafter abandoned him for his aged, jobless grandfather to take care of. As his poor grandfather was unable to feed him and send him to school, the boy fled home and took to scavenging to live. Adeniji had told our correspondent he would love to go back to school if a Good Samaritan comes his way. Barely 24 hours after the report, a philanthropist, who insisted he didn’t want his name mentioned, called to express his desire to adopt the boy and be responsible for his needs. To underline his promise, the philanthropist, who lives in Lagos immediately sent the sum of N20,000 to the boy to rehabilitate him in the short term. He directed that a school be fixed for the boy adding that he would pay for his school fees as soon as he returns from his trip abroad. The Good Samaritan also promised to relocate Adeniji to Lagos as soon as he returns to Nigeria in order to perfect the process of his adoption. Meanwhile, the process of proper rehabilitation of the boy is ongoing at an undisclosed charity home in Ibadan. 24 hours after Eko Trust report on 15-yr-old scavenger, philanthropist pledges adoption Why I resorted to scavenging — 15-yr-old Farouk Man, 58, allegedly sodomises two boys, as father defiles 2-yr-old daughter
