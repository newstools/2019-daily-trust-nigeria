At least 20 people have been killed and 40 injured after a train crash sparked a large fire at Cairo’s main railway station, Egyptian officials say. The train hit a buffer stop near the end of a busy platform at Ramses Station, which is in the city centre. The collision caused the train’s fuel tank to explode, setting the platform and nearby buildings alight. The cause of the crash is not yet clear, but only hours later Transport Minister Hisham Arafat resigned from his position. Witnesses described seeing several severely burned bodies in the latest disaster to hit Egypt’s rundown railways. State-run media earlier reported a higher death toll of at least 25 and as many as 50 injured. During a visit to the scene, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouli vowed to severely punish anyone who was found to have been negligent.
