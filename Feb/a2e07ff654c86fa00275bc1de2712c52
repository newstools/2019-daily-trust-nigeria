The Director General of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) campaign organisation in Gombe State, Alhaji Bala Bello Tinka has defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Popularly known as Tinka Point, the PDP scribe announced his defection after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at State House, Abuja, on Thursday night. Tinka is expected to formally join the APC, alongside others, during the visit of Buhari to the Gombe state tomorrow. Presidential spokesperson, Femi Adesina in a statement, said Tinka Point, has pledged his allegiance to the APC, and also vowed to bring his political weight to bear on the president’s second term bid. “Coming exactly a fortnight to the presidential election, the defection of Alhaji Tinka deals a massive blow to the PDP in Gombe,” Adesina said. PDP currently governs the state, and has done so since 2003.
