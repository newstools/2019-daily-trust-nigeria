The presidential candidate of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar, has said the crowd and the warm reception he got from supporters in Yobe State made him want to stay in the state. The former vice president stated this yesterday during his campaign rally at the August 27 Stadium, Damaturu, the state capital. Atiku told his supporters to come out en masse and vote for him considering that the North East had not produced a president right from independence. “Atiku is your own, vote for me. This will be the first time that the North East will produce a president. So you shouldn’t allow this opportunity to slip away,” he said. The former vice president said the APC had failed in delivering its campaign promises to Yobe, Borno and other parts of the country. “You should vote for all the PDP candidates and guard your votes for this change to happen. I really enjoy my coming to Yobe. In fact, I wouldn’t want to leave the state now,” he said. He promised that if elected, he would reconstruct the highway from Maiduguri, Damaturu to Potiskum. And in Maiduguri, Atiku accused the Nigeria security agencies of interfering in politics. He warned that the trend would scare away the electorate from voting people of their choice. “Security agencies should stop interfering in politics for the good of democracy,” he warned, saying, “they should please allow people to vote candidates of their choice.” He promised to restore peace and security in the Northeast and return all IDPs to their respective homes.
