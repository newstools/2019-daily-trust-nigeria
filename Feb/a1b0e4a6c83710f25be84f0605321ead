The Taraba Good Governance Council has expressed elation at the commissioning of the newly established Forward Operation Base, Gembu, Sardauna Local Government Area of Taraba State by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Lieutenant General TY Buratai. The group, while commending the army chief for being responsive to the demand of the people, said the establishment of the Forward Operation Base was prayer answered for the community. Leader of the group, Istifanus Kifasi, while addressing newsmen in Jalingo, Taraba State on Thursday, said the community was confident that the activation of this Forward Operation Base will put an end to all the ills – sectarian violence, farmers/herders conflict, kidnapping, armed robbery, economic sabotage and insurgency. According to Kifasi, “dealing with these crimes is strategic to providing security across Nigeria. “It is noteworthy that the people of Taraba had given up hope that their safety and security will forever be at the whims of political prevarications but the COAS has proven that all Nigerians matter and that Taraba has a special place in the country with the establishment of the base to deal with challenges that affect the lives of our people. “The reassuring gesture of the Nigerian Army will go a long way to prove naysayers wrong in their earlier claim that the Nigerian Army was not committed to the restoration of peace in the state and neighboring states. The Forward Operation Base will now show how much the Army cares and how far it has gone in discharging its obligations to the people of Taraba state”.
