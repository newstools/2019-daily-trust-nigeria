Ahead of the 2019 governorship election, people of Orlu zone have said that they are contemplating adopting a consensus candidate for the election. Uche Nwosu of Action Alliance (AA) and Hope Uzodinma of All Progress Congress  (APC) are the two candidates from the zone slugging it out in the elections. The people, under the aegis of Orlu Gong, said that irrespective of the fact that an indigene of the zone has been on the saddle as the governor, the zone has nothing to show for it. In a statement signed by the Chairman of the Board of Administrators, Fidel Anujuo and Director of Research and Documentation,  Uche Ohia, the zone expressed regret that Governor Rochas Okorocha who is from Orlu,  has deliberately left the zone undeveloped, concentrating rather on only Owerri Zone. The statement said,  “Whatever decision we take now will not only affect us, our families, our beloved zone and the progress of our state at least for the next four years or even eight years but will probably affect us for the rest of our lives. The zone said that in adopting a consensus candidate, the choice might not necessarily cone from Orlu, but could be any candidate that identifies with the wishes and aspirations of the people.
