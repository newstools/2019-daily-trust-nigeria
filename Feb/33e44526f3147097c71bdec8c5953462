The Plateau State Police Command has called on supporters of the All Progressives Congress celebrating the victory of President Muhammadu Buhari in the Saturday’s election to restrict their celebrations to their homes. Daily Trust reports that hundreds of youths had hit the streets firing firecrackers late Tuesday night and in the early hours of yesterday celebrating Buhari’s victory before the official announcement of the result by the Independent National Electoral Commission. The spokesman of the command, Tyopev Terna, in a statement yesterday, said the warning became necessary to forestall a situation where hoodlums would hijack the celebration to perpetrate evil deeds. “Members of the public are by this public notice advised to remain calm and go about their lawful businesses as security agencies are out to maintain law and order,” it stated.
