The Buhari-Osinbajo Intellectuals Forum has expressed support for President Muhammadu Buhari’s directive to the military and police to deal with ballot box snatchers on election day. In a statement yesterday by its Director General, Alhaji Ibrahim Abdullahi, the forum said the directive would serve as a deterrent to electoral offenders. It said that no sanction shall follow “if there is no offence committed on the electoral process or during the election.” According to the statement, “This forum has watched with keen interest, the various comments coming from political gloadiators, party loyalists, civil society organisations and other well-meaning Nigerians from within and outside the country on Mr President’s directive to the military and other security agencies to deal decisively with the ballot box snatches or any influemtial personality that will like to use his influemce to use thugs and cause havoc during the coming general elections scheduled for 23, February, 2019. We wish to state in a categorical term that this forum is in total support of Mr President’s directive to this effect…” “The forum further supports Mr President in ensuring that the circumstances behind the postponement of the 16th February election are fully investigated and those found wanting are brought to book no matter how placed they are,” the statement read. The forum also called on Nigerians to vote Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and other APC candidates “so that Nigeria will continue to prosper and move to the next level.” Buhari: Snatch ballot box at the expense of your life Buhari showing his true colours with death threat – Atiku Buratai: We’ll treat electoral saboteurs as enemies of state
