Aminu Kano Triangle, the Venue of All Progressive Congress (APC), presidential candidate campaign in Dutse, Jigawa state has filled up ahead of the arrival of the Presidential Candidate of the party, President Muhammadu Buhari. The orderliness among the party faithful at the venue, may not be unconnected to the high presence of security personnel who have taken an absolute control of the venue. The APC presidential hopeful, who is expected to arrive Jigawa from Gombe state, will be visiting the palace of Emir of Dutse before arriving the venue of the campaign. Despite the level of the orderliness in the venue, Journalists are not finding it easy to access the venue as security personnel denied them entry. The difficulty to access the presidential campaign venue, by the Journalists may not be unconnected to the poor organization from the part of the campaign organizers who, were unable to accredit any journalist as at the time of filing this report. Contacted, the governor Muhammadu Badaru Abubakar, spokesperson, Bello Zaki, said arrangement for the provision of tags for the journalists would soon be sorted out. 2019 campaigns: Story behind ‘mammoth’ crowds NSCDC, others mobilize 1,835 operatives for PMB's campaign visit to Jigawa Buhari pledges to invest in agriculture to fight unemployment
