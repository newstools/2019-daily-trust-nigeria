The Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN) has asked its former presidential candidate, Mrs. Oby Ezekwesili, to return all the money generated during her short stint with the party or face court action. The National Chairman of ACPN, Alhaji Ganiyu Galadima, told newsmen that the former minister thought that politics was like the “bring back our girls” project which she coordinated, hence her unacceptable disposition to the party. He said the party rejected the statement of accounts and other documents she submitted due to discrepancies. He said Mrs. Ezekwesili only invested N100,000 being the money she paid for her Expression of Interest form instead of N500,000 which she was supposed to pay, but started sourcing for funds for her presidential campaign even before she joined the party and was given the ticket. “We are rejecting everything she submitted in entirety. We want to know all the content of the accounts and see the accounts because at the end of the day, it is not the presidential candidate that INEC will hold responsible according to the law, but the party,” he said.
