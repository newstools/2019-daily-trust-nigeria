The police yesterday docked a motorcyclist, Adebomisoye Ojo, in a Kubwa Grade 1 Area Court in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) over alleged criminal breach of trust. The defendant, who lives in Kubwa, Abuja, is facing charges of criminal conspiracy, breach of trust and cheating. The prosecutor, Babajide Olanipekun, told the court that Ojo and one other person, now at large, conspired and deceived another person, Igene Purity, who entrusted his Honda motorcycle with them. He said the motorcycle, valued N380,000, was given to the defendant for commercial purpose and to remit N9,000 to Purity weekly. Olanipekun added that the defendant, however, sold the motorcycle and converted the money to his use, noting that the offence contravened sections 97, 312 and 321 of the Penal Code. However, the defendant pleaded not guilty and the defence counsel, Moses Ugwummadu, made bail application for his client, assuring the court that a reliable surety would be provided if granted. The judge, Ibrahim Balarabe, granted the defendant N200,000 bail with one reliable surety who must be resident within the court’s jurisdiction. He adjourned the matter until March 6 for hearing.
