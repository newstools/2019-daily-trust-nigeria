Antonio Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, told African leaders the West has much to learn from them about the treatment of refugees. Speaking during the opening day of the African Union summit in Ethiopia, he said the continent had kept borders open to millions of displaced people despite its limited resources. Africa hosts more than a quarter of the world’s refugees and internally displaced – a total of more than 20 million people. Their plight is high on the summit’s agenda, along with the AU’s attempts to build a continent-wide free trade zone. A deal was signed last year but it’s yet to come into effect as only 19 countries have ratified the agreement. 73,400 African refugees given citizenship of host countries in 2017 — UNHCR Refugees record 65.6 million globally as South Sudan exodus soars UN: 60m people displaced globally
