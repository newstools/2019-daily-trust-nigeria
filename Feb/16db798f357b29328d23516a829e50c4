The Ministry of Interior, Iris Smarts Technology Limited and the Nigeria Security, Printing and Minting PLC have signed an agreement to begin the production of International Passports in Nigeria. No date has, however, been given by parties involved for the commencement of production. Speaking at the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signing ceremony in Abuja, on Tuesday, the Minister of Interior, Abdulrahman Dambazau said the decision to domesticate the production of passports was taken following numerous challenges being encountered in the current arrangement. “I am glad we have decided that it’s the right thing to do. The platform is already there, it’s only for us to key into it. “Iris has an existing contract with the Nigerian government and they have the technology. They will work with the Nigeria Security, Printing and Minting PLC to actualise this plan,” he said. According to him, the production of international passports in the country will protect its security, generate employment for Nigerians and encourage the transfer of technology. Dambazau, who said efforts were being made since two years ago to domesticate the production of the document, urged all parties to get down to work immediately. The Comptroller General of Immigration, Muhammad Babandede, said samples will be tested for quality before giving the permission for mass production of the document. On his part, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Nigeria Security, Printing and Minting PLC, Abbas Masanawa, promised to deliver quality passports that will compete favourably with those of other top countries.
