Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association (NECA) yesterday urged the Federal Government to go beyond inviting foreign investments to providing the necessary support and environment for businesses to thrive in the country. NECA Director-General Timothy Olawale made the appeal at a news conference on the suspension of the operations of Greif Nigeria Plc, marketers and manufacturers of steel drums. Olawale warned that many businesses were closing down due to the unfavourable business environment in the country. Commending government’s efforts at improving the Ease of Doing Business in Nigeria, he, however, urged that efforts be doubled to create conducive operating environment for businesses to thrive. “The association is concerned by the closure of businesses in the country. This trend impacts negatively on the nation’s revenue and increases the unemployment rate.” The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that it is public knowledge that 40-year-old Greif Nigeria Plc manufactures steel drums used for the production of iron and steel has suspended its operations. The company, which had thousands of workers, now has less than 25 workers, according to a reliable source, which preferred anonymity. Greif Nigeria Plc suspended its operations in Nigeria temporarily in February 2019 after poor outings for many months, which was attributed to overwhelming economic challenges. The NECA director-general said that the recent suspension of operations of Greif Nigeria Plc and other manufacturing companies in the country was not good for the economy.
