Gunmen yesterday killed at least 16 people in Agatu village in Agatu Local Government Area of Benue State. The incident was said to have occurred about 1:00am in Ebete, Usha council ward in Agatu. Sources said the victims were fishing, including three Jukun hunters. Force Commander of Operation Whirl Stroke (OPWS), Major-General, Adeyemi Yekini, confirmed the incident to newsmen in Makurdi, saying that, “I received a report this afternoon that some people were killed in Agatu by suspected armed bandits. “I’m not sure of the number of casualty yet but I don’t think it is up to 16.  We have sent a patrol team to the general area where the incident happened. The location where it happened, although is in Benue can better be accessed through Loko in Nasarawa State. We are already sending a patrol team there to verify what really happened.” Meanwhile, the acting chairman of Agatu Local Government Council, Oyigocho, in a statement, appealed to the government to quickly come to their aid because “the incident happening at a time Nigerians are preparing to elect their new leaders during these Saturday elections is capable of disorganising many things.” Gunmen kill 16 in fresh attack on Agatu community Military confirms fresh attack on Agatu community Fish out the soldier’s killers
