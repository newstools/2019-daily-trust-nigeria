A former Governor of Ogun State, Gbenga Daniel on Saturday said the demand for the Chairman of Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof Mahmood Yakubu’s resignation over the election postponement may create a bigger problem. Daniel’s position was contrary to the National Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Uche Secondus’ call for Yakubu, who announced the polls’ shift few hours to the commencement of the election. Secondus in a statement by his Media Aide, Ike Abonyi said the postponement of election had clearly exposed INEC as a failure, hence Yakubu should quit. But the former Governor, who is the Deputy Chairman of PDP Presidential Campaign Council (South), said the INEC Boss should be allowed to conclude the process he started in order not to create a bottleneck for the election.”I accept. It may not be easy for you to ask the INEC chairman to resign, if you don’t want to create a bigger problem. If they now want to have the election next week and you are asking the Chairman to resign, it will create a bigger problem. “I think we should allow him to do what he wants to do before we talk of sanction,” Daniel said. While expressing shock over the shift, the former Governor described it as “the voice of Jacob the hand of Esau.” He warned the electoral umpire that Nigerians would not give room for any foul play. PDP asks INEC boss to resign over shift in election dates PDP won’t accept ‘fake results’ in 2019 – Secondus We'll resist plot to postpone Rivers elections, says Wike
