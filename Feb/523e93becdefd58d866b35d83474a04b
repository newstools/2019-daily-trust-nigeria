The factional chapter of the APC in Lagos State has told its members that aside voting for President Muhammadu Buhari they have the liberty of voting other candidates of their choice irrespective of political party. At a rally for the re-election of President Buhari held at the Alimosho area of Lagos State, the factional Chairman of the party, Fouad Oki, said the dispute between his faction and the other had been taken to court, saying the court would resolve all the grey areas. He said, “Initially, they (the other faction) thought we can’t go this far. They said we will soon peter off. But to their surprise, we have been waxing stronger. And we know that at the end of the day, the court will grant us victory. “Of course, the coming election of President Buhari and Prof. Osinbajo is the one bringing us together. “Possibly, there are other elections that may still bring us together. But for any of our members who left the party out of annoyance, we must vote for them. We must stand by them. That means for every other election, aside the presidential, you are free to vote any candidate of your choice irrespective of their political party; and that was what President Muhammadu Buhari said at his campaign rally in Imo State,” Oki said.
