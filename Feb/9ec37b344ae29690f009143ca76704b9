Food and water vendors enjoyed brisk business at various polling units during Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly elections in the FCT. Our reporter, who went round some of the polling units across Abaji, Kwali, Gwagwalada and Kuje area councils on Saturday, observed as many voters who queued in the sun bought sachet water, cake, groundnut and kunu to snack on. Mrs. Felicia Ebuka, a food vendor at a polling unit in Dobi area of Gwagwalada told our reporter that she decided to hawk bambara nut (okpa) while the election was ongoing because her name was not found on the voters list. She said she could not vote she went back home and prepared okpa to sell to voters who were queuing to cast their votes. Also, a water vendor at Pilot Primary School, Oversea quarters ward in Kwali, Abigail James, said she came prepared to vote and to also sell. “I made adequate preparation for the business of the day. I have cast my own vote, and now I am selling. She added “And as you can see, my sachet water is very cold, because I ensured it is well refrigerated and you can see voters who are on queue how they are rushing to buy,” she said. In Abaji, Anguwar Wanzami polling unit, the situation was the same as voters patronised water and food vendors. Our reporter also observed that despite restriction of vehicle movement, some commercial motorcycle operators were seen making brisk business as they picked passengers from and to various polling stations.
