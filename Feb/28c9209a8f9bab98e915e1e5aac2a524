The Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Babatunde Raji Fashola, will this week commission the 80MVA Yauri Transmission Substation in Kebbi State which was abandoned by the contractors after it was started in December, 2007. The 132/33KV substation completed by the in-house engineers of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) has two units of 40MVA transformers. While one of the transformers has been energised, the other is being tested and will be energised ahead of the commissioning. For over 11 years, residents of Yauri Emirate, mainly along the River Niger, and hosting the reservoir for Kainji Hydropower dam have decried inadequate power supply in the area. TCN noted that when it took over the Yauri substation project, installations were only about 50 per cent after the contractor failed to complete it since December, 2007. However, TCN in-house engineers completed the substation within three months. The General Manager, Public Affairs of TCN, Mrs. Ndidi Mbah, said, “The new Yauri 2x40MVA 330/33kV Transmission Substation was first awarded in December, 2007, but the contractor failed persistently to complete the contract for 11 years. Consequently, TCN took over the project in May, 2018, and completed it.” Fashola to commission 80MVA Yauri substation abandoned since 11 years ago TCN delivers Wudil power substation, 60MVA transformer in Akure TCN energises 330kv line, Damaturu substation in 90 days of takeover
