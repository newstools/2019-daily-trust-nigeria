Foreign and domestic observers who monitored Saturday’s elections in Nigeria say at least 25 persons died during the elections. Speaking yesterday at a joint press conference in Uyo, the observers said the number was higher compared to the 12 persons said to have died in the 2015 elections. The publicity secretary, Pan African Women Project, Republic of South Africa, Mrs Mphoentle Keitseng and Prince Stafford J Bisong of International Leadership Initiative, described the election as a rape on the tenets of democracy by desperate power mongers. They said the election was dramatic and marred in some areas due to the absence or late arrival of election materials, ballot box snatching, and insufficient security personnel at polling units.
