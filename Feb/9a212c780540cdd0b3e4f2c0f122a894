The Emir of Fika, Alhaji Muhammad Ibn Abali Muhammad Idrissa, has appealed to candidates, political parties and their supporters to conduct themselves peacefully in the forthcoming general elections. The emir made the appeal at a press briefing in Potiskum yesterday. “I equally urged that parents should guard their wards against any action that is capable of breaching peace before, during and after elections”, he said. He said people should have faith that the winners of the elections had been selected by God and that the elections were just a formality to confirm what God had destined. The emir also called on religious leaders to preach peace and tolerance. 2019 polls: Emir of Fika urges candidates to eschew violence 2019: Dankwambo tasks monarchs  on peace Fika emir harps on good parenting
