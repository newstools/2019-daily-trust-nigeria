The Muslim Studentsâ€™ Society of Nigeria (MSSN), Lagos State Area Unit, yesterday threatened a showdown over the continued harassment of students wearing hijab. The Amirah (female head) of the MSSN Lagos, Hajia Basheerah Majekodunmi said this in Lagos at a press conference to commemorate the 2019 World Hijab Day. She said female students were going through agonies over hijab despite the circular by the Lagos State Government approving the use of hijab in line with the Court of Appeal verdict. The Amirah noted that despite various verdicts affirming the rights to hijab, there were instances where students were slapped, embarrassed and subjected to emotional trauma for wearing hijab to schools.
