The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sealed off the premises of Growing Circle in Lagos for engaging in alleged illegal fund management activities. The company was shut down for carrying out investment operations that fell within fund management without registration with the apex regulator, SEC said in a statement. The statement also said the commission had established that the company’s activities also constituted an infraction of the Investments and Securities Act (ISA), 2007. According to SEC, “They do not have registration with the SEC and the commission has powers according to Section 13(w) of ISA 2007, to shut down any company carrying out capital market activities without due registration.” The SEC said the closure was to end unlawful activities of the company against unsuspecting investors and therefore urged investors to ensure they only deal with fund managers that are registered with it. “The accounts of the company have been frozen, the promoters have been arrested by the Nigeria Police Force and are undergoing interrogation,” SEC said.
