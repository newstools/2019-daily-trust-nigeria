The Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Pastor Usani Usani, has debunked an allegation that he is being sponsored by Governor Ben Ayade (PDP) to sabotage APC in the state. Usani and Senator John Owan-Enoh, who are APC members, have been in court over the gubernatorial ticket of the party. At the last count, the Appeal Court ruled that “the status quo” be maintained, meaning Pastor Usani had been cleared as the APC governorship candidate for the March election. However, there were allegations that Usani was in the race simply to pave the way for Governor Ayade to win a second term on the platform of PDP. Speaking on the just concluded presidential and National Assembly elections, Usani denied the allegation, describing peddlers of such rumour as wicked and timid. “Everyone is aware that I have contested governorship in this state twice and I have long prepared for this when I had no stake at all. “Several times overtures were made to me by all the governments in power then, yet I was steadfast with APC to justify my conscience. If I did not work for PDP when I had nothing, is it now that I am a  beneficiary of the Federal Government,” he asked. “The misconception about my relationship with the Niger Delta governors, including that of my state, borders on my office as minister of Niger Delta Affairs. It is mandatory that I maintain good relationship with all of them so that the Federal Government’s development programmes in the states are carried out,” he said.
