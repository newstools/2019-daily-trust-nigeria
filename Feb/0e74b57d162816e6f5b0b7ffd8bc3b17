A youth group, the Noble Youths Mass Support Association (NYMSA), an NGO, has berated the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the postponement of general elections. The group coordinator, Godwin Onmonya, who spoke with newsmen in Abuja, yesterday, said it was a huge disappointment that INEC postponed elections when  many Nigerians had already gone out in the early hours of Saturday to vote. He added that many Nigerians travelled for the purpose of voting only to be told that the elections had been postponed. “The effect on businesses, especially the daily earners, international observers already in the country, is not good for our democracy,” he said. He added, “Why must INEC wait this late to announce the postponement of the elections; it’s disheartening,” he said. The coordinator, however, added that the development was capable of changing the minds of people who truly wanted to vote. He further described the postponement as lack of capacity by INEC to conduct free, fair and credible elections in the country.
