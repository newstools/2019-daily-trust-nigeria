Chief Olu Falae has formally resigned as the National Chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SDP). In a letter dated February 19, 2019 and addressed to the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Mahmood Yakubu, the former Secretary to the Government of Federation (SGF) said Prof. Tunde Adeniran would act as SDP national chairman for the rest of his tenure which expired in March, 2020. The letter personally signed by Chief Falae read, “I write to inform you that I have retired voluntarily from active partisan politics with effect from Friday 8th February, 2019, and therefore ceased to be the Chairman of the Social Democratic Party from that date. “In accordance with the provision of Section 13.2 (ii) of our Party constitution, Professor Tunde Adeniran, the Deputy National Chairman 1 from the Chairman’s Zone assumes the post of National Chairman in acting capacity for the rest of my tenure which expires in March, 2020. “I wish to thank you, your fellow commissioners and other staff for the courtesies you always extended to me while I served as the National Chairman of the Social Democratic Party.” On Wednesday, the SDP national leadership threatened to press criminal charges against Prof. Jerry Gana and the expelled factional National Chairman of the party, Chief Supo Shonibare. The SDP Director of Media and Publicity, Hon. Yemi Akinbode, gave the warning to sue the two key political figures in a statement issued shortly after the media briefing by Chief Shonibare where he asked the electorate to come out en masse on Saturday and vote out the APC government contrary to the position of Prof.Tunde Adeniran-led party leadership that backed President Muhammadu Buhari.
