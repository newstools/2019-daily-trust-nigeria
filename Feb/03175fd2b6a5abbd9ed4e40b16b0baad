The Director-General of Atiku/Obi Presidential Campaign in Kwara state, Dr. Ali Ahmad, has alleged that there are plans by the All Progressives Congress (APC) to use some heads of tertiary institutions to cancel election without any justification, particularly in Kwara Central and declare it inconclusive. Ahmad, who is also the Speaker of Kwara state House of Assembly, said information at the campaign office’s disposal is that APC intends to use some staffs of tertiary institutions who have been carefully selected as the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Returning Officers for the hatchet job. He added that “the Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed who is the arrow head of the plot would ensure that the returning officers precipitate violence in some targeted areas only to announce the presidential election result and declare the National Assembly election inconclusive.” He said their objective is to ensure that stand-alone election will be held in Kwara Central whereby the APC can use security to threaten the electorate and have their way. To this end, Ahmad called on INEC, particularly the state Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Malam Attahiru Madami, to take heed by extensively monitoring the returning officers on election days. Also, the Atiku/Obi Campaign Office has voice its support to calls by Kwarans on the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu to immediately redeploy the new Commissioner of Police, Kayode Egbetokun, as demanded by the residents for peace to continue reigning in the state. The director-general said as the former Chief Security Officer to the APC National Leader, Bola Tinubu, there is no how people of Kwara state which is controlled by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) would have full confidence in the new police commissioner. Therefore, he enjoined the IG to as a matter of urgency post Egbetokun to APC-controlled state, saying Kwarans have no trust in him as they believe he would be receiving orders from outsiders.
