The National Assembly, which is scheduled to reconvene tomorrow has put forward its resumption to next Tuesday. The one week postponement was brought about by the suspension of the presidential and National Assembly elections earlier fixed for last Saturday but now shifted February 23. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives in January adjourned their plenary session to allow returning lawmakers embark on campaigns. They had fixed Tuesday as resumption date. But a statement from the Clerk to the National Assembly, Mohammed Sani-Omolori, yesterday said the resumption date has been postponed. Sani-Omolori said lawmakers are expected to reconvene on February 26, which will be three days after the presidential and National Assembly polls.
