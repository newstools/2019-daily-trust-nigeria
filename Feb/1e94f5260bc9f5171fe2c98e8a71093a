The police officers guarding the national secretariat of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have arrested two thieves in the early hours of Monday who attempted to cart away two air conditioners in the office located at Blantyre Street, Wuse II in Abuja. The thieves, it was gathered, had successfully gained entry into the premises after cutting security wires on the fence. At 2:30am, the burglars had already placed one of the two splitting air conditioners on top of the fence for easy transfer onto to a waiting vehicle before the operation was foiled by one of the police officers who heard strange noise in the building. The officer, who preferred anonymity, said he thought the robbers kneeling down in his front was a colleague until a deaf silence he experienced when he called his name after hearing the noise. He said the thief was grabbed within the premises, while the second one was arrested outside the fence. Others, it was learnt, escaped after the operation had been botched by the police. Daily Trust learnt that the incident was aided by lack of adequate security light at the party secretariat as darkness always enveloped the place at night. The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Commissioner of Police, Bala Ciroma, confirmed the development to journalists. Ciroma said, “arrest has been made, while investigation is going on.” Pastor, others arrested for diverting N25m goods in Lagos How soldier-killing suspect was arrested en route Hajj See what intense heat has done to Abuja residents
