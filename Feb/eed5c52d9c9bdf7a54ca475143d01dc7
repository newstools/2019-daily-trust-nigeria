The minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, has urged the people of Kwara state to vote out the government that has extorted the state of its resources to the detriment of the people. The minister made the remarks while addressing the gathering that attended the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential rally in Ilorin, Kwara state on Monday, a statement by his media assistant, Segun Adeyemi said. Mohammed warned that voting the present crop of leaders in Kwara state into power again is like giving them another licence to embark on a looting spree, and urged the people to be wary of their Greek gifts under the guise of offsetting workers’ salaries. The minister who said the time has come to retire the political oligarchs who have appropriated Kwara state and its resources to themselves to the detriment of the people stressed that it was time to retire those who have held Kwara state down and made the people and the state very poor. “They have been deceiving the people. They have been blaming the federal government for their failure. When they can’t pay workers salary, they blame the Federal Government. When they can’t provide infrastructure, they blame the Federal Government. “They forgot to tell the people that Mr. President has graciously approved bailouts and Paris Club Refund for states, including Kwara. Ask them, where is the money? What did they do with it?” he said. “With elections approaching, their leader, I said their leader, NOT the state government, suddenly brought out N2.5 billion from his kitty to pay workers. “Where do individuals pay state workers? Where did the money come from? It is your money that they have been keeping. They have brought out some of it because they are desperate,” he said.
