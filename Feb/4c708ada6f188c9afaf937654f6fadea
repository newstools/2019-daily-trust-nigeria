The Brexit vote must not be frustrated and the government needs to maintain an “absolute” focus on delivering it, Theresa May has said. In a speech to Tory activists the PM said, as her negotiations with the EU reach their final stages, the “worst thing we could do is lose our focus”. It came as three pro-EU cabinet members warned they could vote to delay Brexit to prevent a “disastrous” no-deal. But Mrs May said there must be no party “purges” over MPs with differing views. Ahead of crucial votes in the Commons next week, Greg Clark, Amber Rudd and David Gauke told the Daily Mail they would be prepared to defy the prime minister and vote for a delay. The intervention led to calls for their resignations by Tory Brexiteers.
