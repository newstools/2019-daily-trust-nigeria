The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has commenced the airlift of electoral materials for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) across the country for the conduct of the 2019 general elections. A statement on Tuesday from Air Force spokesman, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, said the airlift exercise which started on 11th February, includes day and night missions, during which both sensitive and non-sensitive electoral materials were conveyed in batches, with NAF C-130 Hercules aircraft from the Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport, Abuja to various airports across the country.  He said the materials were duly delivered by the C-130H aircraft crew to teams of INEC and Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) officials together with security personnel waiting at the various airports. He noted that the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, during his meeting with Air Officers Commanding (AOCs) and NAF Field Commanders on 1 February 2019, had expressed the readiness of the NAF to avail INEC its transport aircraft to enable expeditious movement of electoral materials, as done in the past. He said the transport aircraft are deployed solely to provide airlift support to meet INEC’s logistics requirements, in fulfilment of NAF’s constitutional role of providing military aid to civil authority.
