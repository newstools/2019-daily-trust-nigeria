Daily Trust recalls that in 2015, the Commission headed then by Professor Attahiru Jega had shifted the Presidential/National Assembly Election date from February 14 and Governorship/States Assemblies election date billed for February 28 to March 28 and April 11, 2015 respectively, citing security reasons. The country also witnessed a shift in the 2011 elections.
