Christian and Muslim leaders in Karu Local Government Area of Nasarawa State, which borders the FCT, yesterday, commenced a two-day interfaith dialogue ahead of the 2019 general elections. Speaking at the opening of the peace campaign and education to promote interfaith in the council, organised by the Nigerian Inter-Faith Action Association (NIFAA), the Esu Karu, Luka Panya Baba, said peace should be the watchword between Christians and Muslims to ensure the success of the elections. Represented by the Madakin Karu, Joshua Madaki, the Esu Karu urged the people to continue to live in peace, especially as they approached the 2019 elections. “Living in peace is the best. Though Christians and Muslims in Karu have been living in peace, we are fully in support of the peace process. NIFAA and all the religious leaders should carry out their activities faithfully with peace as the watchword,” the Esu said. The Executive Director of NIFAA, Bishop Sunday Onuoha, said the effort of the organisation was to unite Christians and Muslims. Represented by Malam Murtala Abdulrahman, Bishop Onuoha said the peace effort was for the benefit of the community and humanity. “We must continue to live peacefully with one another; that is the focus of our organisation. We are seeking to harness religious harmony for development of the country,” he said. “We want good understanding between Christians and Muslims; including building relationships between the religious leaders. We are here to facilitate peace and understanding between Muslims and Christians during elections. Places of worship should lead the people to understand that it is only peace that will bring development and allow the people to worship God properly,” he added. 2019 Elections: Sultan urges Nigerians to shun conflict, violence 2019 elections: Sultan urges religious leaders to maintain neutrality Interfaith group trains 30 Muslim, Christian youth leaders on peaceful elections
