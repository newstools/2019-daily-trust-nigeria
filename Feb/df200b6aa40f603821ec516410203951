The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), is set to postpone Nigeria’s Presidential Election a few hours before polling is due to open on Saturday morning. Members of the commission have been in an emergency meeting for about 6 hours and are expected to agree on a new date for the Presidential election. A source at the meeting told Daily Trust that ”8 am today is certainly out. Next week Saturday is most probable.” A statement on the INEC position is expected shortly.
