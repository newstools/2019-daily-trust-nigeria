Bayelsa State Traditional rulers have thrown their weight behind the corruption war of President Muhammadu Buhari, saying it has brought the country to the limelight. The monarchs spoke when they hosted Buhari at their council Secretariat in Yenagoa, the Bayelsa state capital. The president was in the state, as part of his re-election campaign. Recall that president Buhari defeated former President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, who hails from Otuoke in Bayelsa State, in 2015 when he pledged to fight corruption in the country under the previous administration. Speaking on behalf of the monarchs, Chairman, Bayelsa State Traditional Rulers Council, Amanayabo of Twon Brass, King Alfred Diete-Spiff said they were proud of the president. “Your corruption war has brought Nigeria to the limelight. We are proud of it,” the monarch told Buhari. The monarch, who was the first military governor of Rivers state, appealed to the president to facilitate the inclusion of the traditional rulers in the country’s constitution to give them a sense of belonging. 2019: Imo monarchs endorse Buhari ‘Monarchs don’t need constitutional obligation, their roles are divine’ Buhari: Why I didn’t go on exile
