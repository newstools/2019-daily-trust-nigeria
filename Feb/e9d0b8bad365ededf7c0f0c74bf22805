A stalwart of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Abubakar Sidi, says he has withdrawn from the party and pitched his tent with the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the FCT. Alh. Sidi, a former FCT campaign coordinator for Goodluck/Sambo 2015 campaign, said he was no longer with the PDP because of the calibre of its present leaders, who have abandoned the vision of the founding fathers and those who suffered for the party. He said he felt slighted by the downgrading and what he described as betrayal by new entrants who have hijacked the party and sidelined the old members. Sidi said the security situation in Nigeria has greatly improved and that the level of poverty, ethnic, religious and tribal divisions significantly reduced since APC came to power in 2015. He said the present leadership was making effort to right the wrongs of the past and therefore the next four years will prosperous for the party as it sweeps the polls.
