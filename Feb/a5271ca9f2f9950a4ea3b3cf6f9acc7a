The National Chairman of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Uche Secondus, yesterday said the party would resist any form of rigging and declaration of fictitious results in the coming elections. Secondus spoke in Makurdi at the PDP presidential campaign. “The leaders of the APC in Benue are threatening to use the police and military to rig the elections in Benue, they should be prepared for grave consequences. We will not allow or accept any rigged result,” he said. He called on the federal government to set up an enquiry to probe the recent comment of the Kaduna State governor, Nasir El’Rufai, who threatened that foreigners would be returned to their countries in body bags if they meddled in the election. Governor Samuel Ortom expressed confidence that Benue people would unanimously cast their votes for Atiku to become the next president of Nigeria.
