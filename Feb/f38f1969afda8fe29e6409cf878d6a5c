Sri Lanka has begun a search for two executioners with “strong moral character” as part of a crackdown on drug smuggling. The job, advertised in the state-run Daily News paper, pays 36,310 rupees ($158) a month. Capital punishment is legal in Sri Lanka but no executions have taken place since 1976. The country has struggled to find a permanent executioner after its last hangman resigned five years ago. The dedicated role is open to any Sri Lankan males aged 18-45 who possess “mental strength.” Malaysia 2014: Nigeria Cricket team leaves for Sri-Lanka tour SRI LANKA: Govt to ban Hindu  animal sacrifice S/Arabia ''spares'' Sri Lankan maid in adultery case
