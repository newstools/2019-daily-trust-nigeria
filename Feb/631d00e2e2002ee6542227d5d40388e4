Fifty journalists from 49 African and Asia-Pacific countries, on Wednesday, commenced a 10-month media and cultural exchange fellowship at the China Africa Press Centre (CAPC) in Beijing, China. The fellowship, inaugurated in 2014, is part of Asian nation’s efforts to deepen ties with Africa and “tell China’s story better” to the world. It allows African journalists to cover major political and diplomatic events, meet with Chinese officials from relevant ministries and departments and exchange views with Chinese media outlets and academics.
