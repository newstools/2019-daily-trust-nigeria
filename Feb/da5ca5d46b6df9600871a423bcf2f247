The Executive Secretary of Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) Professor Suleiman Elias Bogoro said he has come back with a renewed vigour to serve the Fund and the country. Bogoro stated this over the weekend when he received a delegation from the University of Maiduguri (Unimaid) led by its Vice Chancellor Professor Ibrahim Abubakar Njodi. Speaking, Professor Njodi congratulated Professor Bogoro, saying Unimaid recognizes his leadership qualities noting that his unprecedented recall to serve at the Fund again by President Muhammadu Buhari (GCON) is a confirmation of the confidence Nigerians have in his administrative and Managerial acumen. The Executive Secretary in his response thanked the Vice Chancellor and contended that the size of the delegation not only made him emotional but also evoked a feeling of nostalgia remembering his days as a student at the University. The TETFund boss also commended the Vice Chancellor of the University and his Management team for their promptness in accessing their yearly allocations, a feat which he noted many of the Beneficiary Institutions are still struggling with.
