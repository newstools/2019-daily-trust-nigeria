The Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Dr. Okechuchwu Enelamah has said the private sector is not sufficiently aware of the number reforms carried out by the government. Enelamah made the remark at the interactive session on the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC) in Lagos. He said: “ we have carried out over 140 business reforms in the last three years, we lost 64 point in the ease of doing business in the in 8 years leading to 2015, but we have now climned 24 points in 3 years. “The private sector did not appear to be sufficiently aware. I believe in the power of compound interest, because if people are not aware, how can they consume the service, if theymdont consume, how can we claim to have rendered the service. “So we want to work together so that it becomes our way of working.” The minister also said the various criticisms by members of the opposition against ‘tradermoni’ is a sign that the scheme is working.
