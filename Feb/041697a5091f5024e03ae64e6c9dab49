The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has asked Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu to resign following the Commission’s postponement of the 2019 general election at the 11th hour. The PDP described the shift as a grand plan to rig in favour of candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), President Muhammadu Buhari. The PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus said in a statement by his Media Aide, Mr. Ike Abonyi that the shift in dates of the election as announced by Chairman of the INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu in the early hours of Saturday had clearly exposed INEC as a failure, hence Yakubu should quit. Yakubu said that the Presidential and National Assembly elections earlier scheduled for today would now hold on February 23, while that of governorship, state Houses of Assembly and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), slated for March 2, now hold on March 9, citing logistics and operational issues. But Secondus alleged that the shift was done to thwart the will of the people who he said had already reached a consensus to vote candidate of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar. “Having failed in all their nefarious options to enable them cling on to power, the APC and the INEC came up with the idea of shifting the election, an action that is dangerous to our democracy and is therefore unacceptable,” he said. “The APC in connivance with the INEC have been trying all options including but not limited to burning down INEC offices in some states and destroying of electoral materials to create artificial problems upon which to stand for their dubious act,” he added.
