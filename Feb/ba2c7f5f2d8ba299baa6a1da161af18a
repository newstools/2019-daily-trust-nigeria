The Lagos State steering committee on youths of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Campaign Council at the weekend inaugurated a 114-member committee representing all the 57 local governments and local council development areas in the state. The objective of constituting the committee is to galvanise grassroots support among the youth for the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. The committee’s coordinator, Mr Kunle Oyewunmi, speaking at the inauguration of the body at the Omole area of Lagos State, said President Buhari was committed to building a prosperous future for the country. Oyewunmi urged Nigerian youths to give robust support to Buhari’s second term bid as they would be the greatest beneficiaries. “Because the youths are the future leaders of tomorrow, we have to give robust support to President Buhari because what he is doing is towards building a prosperous nation so that our unborn generations can benefit from decent asociety,” the coordinator stated. According to Oyewumi, “President Buhari’s achievements make him deserving of the vote of Lagosians and the entire South-West people for a second term in office. The achievements, he said, could be seen in the re-construction of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, the Lagos-Abeokuta railway project and the multi-million dollar Cancer Centre at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), which he described as the first of its kind. Others, he said, include the N-Power and Tradermoni projects, from which he said many beneficiaries had emerged. Oyewumi said coordinators and secretaries assigned to each of the councils and LCDAs were expected to mobilise not less than 70 per cent of the youth population in Lagos State based on national projection by the Directorate of Youth Mobilisation of the Buhari/Osinbajo Campaign under the leadership of Dr Tony Nwoye. 2019: Lagos Youth Committee unveils office, holds ‘FeBuhari Roadwalk’ Why I defected to APC - Emmanuel Uduaghan Yoruba youths rally for "Crocodile Smile"
