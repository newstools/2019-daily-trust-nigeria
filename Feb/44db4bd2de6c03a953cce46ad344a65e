Hundreds of IDPs of the Teachers Village IDPs Camp, Maiduguri, yesterday protested over alleged inadequate care, demanding to be returned to their respective home local government areas immediately. They blocked the road between the camp and Bulumkutu ward of the metropolis, resulting in the deployment of a detachment of the anti-riot police, who dispersed the protesters with teargas. Majority of the IDPs at the camp were packed there after the insurgents had sacked their communities in Kukawa Local Government. They alleged gross inadequacy of feeding as well as diversion of relief items by the camp officials. “We were abandoned to our individual devices in feeding and other aspects of care,” Abba Mohammed, from Kukawa, complained to Daily Trust. Fatima Hassan, from Cross-Kauwa, complained: “You are not allocated shelter, or even allowed into the camp, if you do not possess the PVC; officials say you must possess it to be allowed to stay in the camp; majority of us are sleeping in the open, without adequate care.” The head of the National Emergency Management Agency’s food Intervention in Borno State, Manga Salisu Danjuma, when contacted, said: “I was surprised to hear that they were protesting; just three weeks ago, NEMA distributed food items to all those who came last month and had captured them in our monthly rations. They were not being fair to us, but we are going to start another distribution tomorrow (today) so that they have enough food at homes. We are trying our best to make sure that they get their rations as at times due”.
