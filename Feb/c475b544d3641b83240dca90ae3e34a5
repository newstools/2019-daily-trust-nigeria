The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Niger State has formerly replaced the name of Senator David Umaru with that of Mohammed Sani Musa as candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC) for Niger East senatorial district in the February 23 election in the state. The replacement was sequel to a Federal High Court judgment, declaring Musa as the winner of the party’s primaries ahead of the general elections. Musa had approached a federal high court in Abuja, praying it to set aside the nomination and/or submission of the name of Senator Umaru as candidate for the area by APC and replace same with his own. The Court subsequently granted his prayers by ordering INEC to effect the changes. Senator Umaru had swiftly appealed the court’s verdict at the Court of Appeal in Abuja and also applied for stay of execution of the decision of the trial court. However, INEC headquarters, in a letter to the Resident Electoral Commissioner (INEC) in the state, Prof Sam Egwu dated 15th February, directed him to substitute the name of Umaru earlier published with that of Musa as candidate. “The Commission in pursuant to the order of the court in Suit No. FHC/ABJ/CS/140/2018 Mohammed Sani Musa V.APC and 2 others, has directed that the name of David Umaru earlier published as the candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC) for Niger East senatorial district be removed and replaced by the name of the plaintiff, Mohammed Sani Musa. “You are requested to update your record with respect to the above in view of the Final List of candidates earlier forwarded to you please, ” the letter, which was signed by Mrs Rose Oriaran-Anthony, Secretary of the Commission said.
