The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has described last week’s flag-off by President Muhammad Buhari of oil and gas drilling operations in the Spud-In of Kolmani River-11 well in the Gongola Basin in Bauchi State as a welcome development that will open new prospects for the oil and gas industry in Nigeria. ACF in a statement signed by its national publicity secretary, Alhaji Muhammad Ibrahim Biu said the political will mustered by the Federal Government to pursue oil exploration in the northern part of the country is in line with the current administration’s economic recovery and growth plan (ERGP) which can boost economic benefits in the North and Nigeria. The forum then commended the FG for the initiative and urged it to sustain oil and gas exploration efforts in the other frontier basins in the country. Said the forum: “In this respects, ACF appeals to the Nigeria National Petroleum Company (NNPC) to courageously and fully ensure that the Presidential directive on the oil exploration campaigns in Chad Basin, Gongola,Anambra,Sokoto, Bida Basins and Benue Trough are carried out to the letter and spirit. “ACF also appeals to the FG to also create and provide an enabling environment that will encourage other oil companies to invest and participate in the oil and gas exploration in the North,” saying this is because oil and gas exploration will in no small measure add value to the nation’s economy.” IBB university explores oil, gas in Bida, Sokoto basins Oil find in Lake Chad basin Fresh battle as exploration agency is removed from PIB
