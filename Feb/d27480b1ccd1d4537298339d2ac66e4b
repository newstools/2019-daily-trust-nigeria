The INEC office in Kebbi State has urged political parties to be wary of election results posted in the social media prior to the official declaration of results by the commission. The Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in the state, Alhaji Ahmad Mahmud, gave the advice at an interactive session with political parties’ stakeholders in Birnin Kebbi. He said fake news was now a trend and could jeopardise efforts towards ensuring free, fair and credible elections. Mahmud added that only INEC returning officers at ward, local government and state levels had the statutory authority and power to declare results. “We have all the sensitive materials in the custody of the CBN, so we have no fear for the materials now,” he said. He said by Wednesday, they would start distributing the election materials to remote areas. “We hope to finish the distribution in all the 21 local government areas by Friday,” he said. He assured that INEC was determined to conduct free, transparent and fair elections.
