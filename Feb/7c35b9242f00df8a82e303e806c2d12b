The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibadan Zonal Office, yesterday secured the conviction of two men, Gbolahan Osikoya and Rabiu Daniel, for offences bordering on impersonation and fraudulently sharing pornographic and indecent pictures. Osikoya and Daniel were arraigned before Justice Watilat Ibrahim of a Federal High Court sitting in Abeokuta, Ogun State, on December 10, 2018, with both charged with separate one-count offences. The charge against Osikoya read that he, posing as Mary and Lisa Burkholder, sometime in 2018 at Awa-Ijebu, Ogun State, knowingly sent pornographic and indecent pictures with his e-mail to one Michael Lukianoff and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 24 (1) (a) and punishable under Section 24 (1) of the Cyber Crimes (Prohibition, Prevention Etc) Act, 2015. Daniel was also said to have, on June 23, 2018 at Awa-Ijebu, Ogun State, fraudulently impersonated one Agent Howard Hall working for the Government/Facebook Compensation Bonus and Poverty Eradication in order to gain undue advantage for himself and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 22 (3) (a) and punishable under Section 22 (4) of the Cyber Crimes (Prohibition, Prevention Etc) Act, 2015. The two men pleaded guilty to the charge, after opting for a plea bargain. In view of the plea, counsel for the EFCC, Abdulrasheed Suleman, prayed the court to convict them accordingly. Justice Ibrahim consequently convicted them and sentenced them to four months each in prison, starting from the date of their arrest. Osikoya was also ordered to forfeit his Honda Accord car, two phones and a laptop computer to the federal government. In addition to forfeiting his two iPhones and laptop computer, Daniel was ordered to refund $500 to his victim.
