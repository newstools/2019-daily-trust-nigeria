Speaking to Kanem Trust on phone, the emir said the elections was conducted in an orderly and peaceful atmosphere throughout the emirate. “I have never been so happy as today when I saw my people, despite Boko haram threats, sacrificed their lives to vote for credible candidates for a better Nigeria. I pray to God that the votes of my people count” he said. He said that the people in a convoy of more than 500 vehicles returned to the town and voted. “If you see the mammoth of crowd that voted, you will be surprised. At the voting venue, people were saying that some Boko Haram boys lurked around with guns to shoot voters but they all turned deaf ears,” he said. The emir described the election as smooth and peaceful, while calling on the candidates to accept the outcome of the election in good faith. “They should not take election as a do or die affair. No position in this world is as precious as human life,” he added.
