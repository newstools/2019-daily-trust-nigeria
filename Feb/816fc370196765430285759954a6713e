Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (Jamb) yesterday said the registration exercise for the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) would end today. The board also said the mock UTME scheduled for Saturday, February 23, 2019, has been postponed. Spokesperson of the board, Dr Febian Benjamin said by telephone that the UTME registration exercise which started on January 10 would end today as planned and that the mock exams, which was supposed to hold on Saturday, was canceled because the rescheduled presidential election would take place that day, too. He said a new date would be announced. Benjamin said the board had registered 1.8 million candidates for the 2019 UTME which was expected to take place March 23.
