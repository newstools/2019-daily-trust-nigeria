Over 1,300 people displaced by bandits’ attacks at villages in Katsina State last week have relocated to Batsari town. They are from Sabon Garin Dunburan, Garin Labo, Kwandatso, Garin Yara, Shigi, Garin Dodo and Dan Tudun Garin Yara. Bandits had in an attack on Kasai village killed an army captain and three civilians. The spokesman of the state police command, Gambo Isah, yesterday allayed fears, saying “We want to curtail all bandits there. So, they (IDPs) are moving out of fear, they should remain calm and be rest assured the security operatives are on top of the situation. They should not panic because of the redeployment.” Villagers flee as bandits attack Katsina Katsina: Banditry spike drives hundreds from villages Bandits’ attack: Masari calls for vigilance
