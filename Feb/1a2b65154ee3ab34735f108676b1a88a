The Oluwo of Iwoland, Oba (Dr) Abdulrosheed Adewale Akanbi, says Vice President Yemi Osinbajo survived the weekend’s helicopter crash owing to God’s grace he enjoyed for his clean heart for the nation’s survival. The royal father said this in a statement yesterday by his Press Secretary, Alli Ibraheem. The Oluwo, who noted that only those enjoying God’s love and serving with a “pure mind” survive an incident of such magnitude, assured Osinbajo of what he called “spiritual protection against all odds.” He prayed for more protection for the vice president and his crew, describing him as one of the leading assets of the Yoruba race. “Nothing bad will happen to Osinbajo, most especially at this critical time when his life is much needed by the common masses. He will live long to be one of the best world leaders. His current position is just a stepping stone to next level. “Whatever evil to befall Yemi Osinbajo should be forgiven and redirected. I use my position to arrest them. Osinbajo is a factor in Nigeria. God, in His infinite mercy and guidance, will continue to protect him and his crew,” the Oluwo prayed.
