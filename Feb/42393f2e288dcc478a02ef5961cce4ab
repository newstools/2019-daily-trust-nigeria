The Minister of the FCT, Muhammad Musa Bello, has called on civil servants in the territory to play roles that will promote peaceful elections in the territory. Bello, represented by the acting Secretary, Social Development Secretariat, Hajiya Safiya Umar, made the call at a sensitisation of stakeholders ahead of the general elections organised by the National Orientation Agency (NOA) in Abuja on Wednesday. The minister said if civil servants failed to join in sensitising residents of the FCT on the significance of peaceful elections, right persons and steps would not be put in place. He said, “So we as civil servants should sit up and do the needful so that there will be strong systems that would benefit all and stand the test of time.” Earlier, the Director General of NOA in the FCT, Mr. David Dogo, said the agency decided to organise the sensitisation forum for civil servants as part of effort to make the general elections peaceful. Mr. Dogo said with the technical issues that were involved in elections, there was the need for continued awareness, and he, therefore, urged key stakeholders to educate the people closest to them on how to adhere to electoral processes. He said proper orientation in rural areas would bring about hitch-free polls. He, therefore, requested the stakeholders to facilitate a forum for the agency to sensitise a cross section of FCTA staff on the elections.
