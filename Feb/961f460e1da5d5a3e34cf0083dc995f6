The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has accused the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of hoarding the presidential and senatorial elections result sheets for undisclosed reasons. The party also alleged that PDP agents were being denied INEC accreditation and identification cards, ostensibly to shut them out of the election monitoring process and allow the All Progressives Congress (APC) a field day to “manipulate” the process. The Director, Media and Publicity of the PDP Presidential Campaign Organisation, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, said in a statement yesterday that information available to the party showed that INEC had been distributing sensitive election materials in most states of the federation without the presidential and senatorial elections result sheets. “The development is already heightening tension and suspicion of underhand methods by the commission to open the elections for manipulations and allow the APC to enter fictitious results for onward transmission to collation centers. “The PDP therefore cautions INEC to show its impartiality by immediately releasing the presidential and senatorial elections results sheet as well as the accreditation cards. Any further delay will be a clear recipe for crisis as Nigerians are already highly agitated over the matter. “INEC should note that Nigerians are very anxious about this election and any action that in anyway portrays or tends to portray the process as being manipulated is capable of triggering a crisis,” the PDP said.
