The Coca-Cola Company has completed the acquisition of Chi Limited after three years of 40 per cent investment. In a statement by the President of Coca-Cola, West Africa Business unit, Peter Njonjo, at a press briefing, he said Coca-Cola Company in 2016 acquired a 40 per cent investment in Chi Limited and the company has extended its minority investment to a full ownership by acquiring the remaining 60 per cent making the acquisition complete. While Njonjo was revealing the reasons for the acquisition, he said Chi Limited like Coca-Cola was a beverage company and it complements the existing portfolio of the company, which will also aid the acceleration of the expansion of the Chi products into the global market. He said “The acquisition is a testament to the commitment of the company being a total beverage company, and the desire to grow the Chi products into a global billion dollar brands, that will meet the needs of the customers satisfactorily.” According to him, Chi Limited would continue to operate as an independent company with no interference from the Coca-Cola but would build the company in a way that will make it experience wider range of products distribution internationally. “We will not tamper with the brand in any form, the management of the Chi Limited will operate as before but rather we will grow both the Chi and the Hollandia units of the products and support Chi management team in building on the company’s remarkable heritage and achievement, while using the coca-cola system to replicate their success in more markets across Africa,” he said.
