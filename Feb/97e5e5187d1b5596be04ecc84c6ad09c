The Commander General of Kano state Hisbah Board, Sheikh Aminu Ibrahim Daurawa, has explained that he led 100 Imams in Kano to visit Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso to mediate between the former governor and some Islamic scholars in the state. Kwankwaso has been at loggerheads with some Islamic scholars after he accused some of the preachers of meddling into politics. In a telephone interview, Sheikh Daurawa said he was at the house of the former governor to douse tensions mounting between him (Kwankwaso) and the Ulamas. Sheikh Daurawa said that as a respected scholar in the state, he is expected to intervene in whatever has the potential of leading to crisis in the state. “You know it was alleged that Senator Kwankwaso has made some statement regarding religious issues and this statement has made some Ulamas in the state to challenge and questioned the utterances leading to tension. It was also reported that, the Ulamas had taken decision to continue challenging Kwankwaso in their Friday sermons”. However, there are speculations that the Hisbah boss risk losing his job for leading the team of Ulamas on a visit to the former governor who is seen as an opposition to the state government. Our reporter gathered that  the office of the commander is under lock and key.    Hisbah: Local security outfit celebrates sixth anniversary Are Kwankwaso and Ganduje now political foes?
