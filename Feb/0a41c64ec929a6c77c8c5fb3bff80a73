Popular Nollywood actress, Kate Henshaw, alongside Bimbo Manuel, Sani  Muazu, Enyinna  Nwigwe, Linda Ejiofor and Yakubu Mohammed, has starred in a new movie, 4th Republic. In a statement by the organisers, Henshaw, who acted the role of Mabel King, flexed her political muscles as a gubernatorial candidate in the upcoming new political thriller. “4th Republic is not just a film right for the election period. I think what is most significant is the message it carries; we need to stand up for the truth and fight for justice. It’s our duty,” Henshaw was quoted in the statement. According to the statement, after her campaign manager Sikiru (Jide Attah) turns up dead, gubernatorial aspirant Mabel King (Henshaw) challenged the victory of the incumbent, Idris Sani (Sani Mu’azu) for her mandate. King is supported by her aide Ike (Eyinna Nwigwe) and Sikiru’s daughter, Bukky (Linda Ejiofor) while Sani’s associate St. James (Bimbo Manuel) and Ike’s Law School rival, Danladi (Yakubu Mohammed) try to take down witnesses. “The action-packed thriller will take viewers from voting polls marred by violence and rigging to the law court as Mabel King petitions the tribunal for the seat of governor she believes was stolen from her. “4th Republic is written by Emil B. Garuba and Zainab Omaki but was directed by Ishaya  Bako. It is co-produced by Griot Studios Ltd. and Amateur Heads Productions with Bem  Pever, Ishaya Bako, Kemi ‘Lala’ Akindoju and Ummi A. Yakubu serving as Producers. The film is funded by grants from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and the Open Society Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA). 4th Republic was shot on location in Abuja, Lokoja and Lagos and is set for release in cinemas across Nigeria from April 2019. It is distributed by FilmOne Distribution,” the statement read.  New Genevieve flick to be released From Kannywood, Nollywood to…politics? From screen to books: 5 celebs who have written memoirs
