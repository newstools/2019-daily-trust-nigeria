The Zamfara State governorship candidate of APGA, Alhaji Sani Abdullahi Shinkafi, has raised the alarm that many elec-toral wards in the state are under siege few days to the general elections. Alhaji Shinkafi told newsmen yesterday at a press confer-ence in Abuja that the attack on communities and killing of citizens was a threat to the conduct of credible polls in the state. He appealed to INEC to create alternative polling units in the state so that all the displaced citizens could vote. Shinkafi, a former National Secretary of APGA, also called on the Federal Government and security agencies to come up with practical measures that would adequately bring the activities of bandits to an end. “We are talking about the killing of so many people and over 400 people under captivity in the state and many elec-toral wards under siege,” he said.
