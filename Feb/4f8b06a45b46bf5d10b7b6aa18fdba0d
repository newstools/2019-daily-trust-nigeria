The Ekiti State government has declared its determination to resuscitate the three abandoned women skills acquisition institutions the federal government built and handed over to the state in 2018. The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development, Mrs Foluke Adeyemo, stated this yesterday when she visited the institutions, which are the Women Development Skills Acquisition Centre, Ado-Ekiti; Women Development Skills Acquisition Centre, Ipoti-Ekiti and the Cassava Cottage Industry located, Osin-Ekiti. Expressing her displeasure at the vandalization of the facilities, Mrs Adeyemo charged residents in communities where the facilities are located to secure them. She said that the resuscitation and effective utilization of the facilities would put a stop to the actions of the vandals and make the centres generate funds for the state government. Earlier, the ministry’s Zonal Officer for Ijero, Mrs Modupe Olujobi, who claimed to be the only staff working there, had lamented the poor condition of the building the ministry was using as its office and requested a better office accommodation and staff reinforcement. Other facilities visited by the Permanent Secretary included the Ijero Social Welfare Zonal Office, Women Development Skills and Acquisition Centre at Ipoti, Ido Social Welfare Zonal Office, Ikole Social Welfare Zonal Office and Cassava Cottage Industry at Osin-Ekiti.
