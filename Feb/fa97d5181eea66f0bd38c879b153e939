The Economic and Financial Crime Commission, EFCC, has warned financial institutions in Benue State to stay away from politicians’ money during the period of elections so as not to run foul of the law. Head of the EFCC’s zonal office in Makurdi, Johnson Ayodeji Babalola, gave the warning in a meeting with bankers, journalists and Bureau de Change merchants at his office in Makurdi. “It is on record that we have called you to warn you. Stay away from politicians’ money,” he said. Babalola, who also decried the huge sum of dollars currently in circulation nationwide, advised financial institutions in the state to report any suspicious movement of monies or transactions to the EFCC. He warned the Bureau de Change operators not to change dollars for politicians who want to buy votes while also urging the banks not to release monies which are clearly against the money laundering act. “Let us get this election right. If we don’t get democracy right, this country can’t develop,” the EFCC zonal head maintained. 2011: A return to ‘Obasanjo days’ as Farida Waziri opens EFCC’s ‘book of corruption’ N2.05Bn fraud: EFCC arrests bureau de change operators, undergraduates Ex-minister: EFCC quizzed us over campaign funds
