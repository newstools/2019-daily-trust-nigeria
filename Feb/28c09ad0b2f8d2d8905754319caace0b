The Director Media and Publicity of the PDP Presidential Campaign Organisation, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, told newsmen, yesterday in Abuja, that INEC Chairman Prof. Mahmood Yakubu had allegedly succumbed to pressure to replace electoral officers in PDP strongholds in order to rig the election in favour of President Muhammadu Buhari.
