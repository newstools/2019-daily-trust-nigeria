The Ogun State Governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, on Monday, warned security operatives to allow party supporters who are denied access to the venue of the All Progressive Party, APC presidential rally in Abeokuta, in order to avoid stampede. Amosun, who is monitoring the goings-on at the MKO Abiola International Stadium, Kuto, also accused the security agents of teargassing party faithful. Daily Trust reports that the venue is already filled to its capacity as party supporters await the arrival of President Muhammadu Buhari’s campaign train any moment from now. Amosun said: “Don’t come and create crisis for us in Ogun State particularly the SSS men and the police too. I noticed you’re using teargas, please don’t try it. “We are not going to allow our people to stay outside. We don’t want stampede. “So, security operatives, I am putting you on notice, our people must not be pinned down. They will not stay on the tracks (in the stadium), they will stay on the grass. “Secondly, any moment from now, our father and his entire team will be here.” Amosun dares Oshiomhole, says Ogun APC excos will complete tenure Allied party adopts Buhari in Ogun I’m still in APC–Amosun
