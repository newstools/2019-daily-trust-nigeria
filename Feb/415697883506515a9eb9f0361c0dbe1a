Russian investigators have charged US investor Michael Calvey with fraud, in a case that has further strained ties between the two nations. Mr Calvey, the founder of the Baring Vostok investment fund, is suspected of embezzling 2.5bn roubles ($38m; £29m) from a Russian bank. Mr Calvey, who was held last week with five other suspects, denies this. The US embassy in Moscow said Russia was denying US diplomats access to Mr Calvey, seven days after his arrest.
