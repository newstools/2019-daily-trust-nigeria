The Civic Advancement for Rural Empowerment Initiatives (CARE), an NGO,  said it has embarked on mass mobilisation of women to actively participate in the 2019 general elections. The state Coordinator, Ismail Bello, said this renewed effort was in line with the international clarion calls for bridging the gap created by long-term discrimination against women. According to him, making women visible in politics would make us to recognise women in the political sphere, and include them in both appointive and elective positions. “It is no doubt that women still remain highly marginalised, discriminated against; and are under-represented in political life of the nation. This is more obvious when the proportion of men to women in politics and decision making positions is low  despite the fact that women represent 50 percent of the nation’s population” he said He said, several challenges that Nigerian women still face in active participation in politics include discriminatory socio-cultural and religious practices, lack of finance, under-representation of women in governance, unhealthy and political environment, among others. “Thus, the recommended measures to guarantee women active participation in politics in Nigeria included review of discriminatory practices, economic empowerment,  support from family, fellow women and media as well as equal representation in governance,” he said.
