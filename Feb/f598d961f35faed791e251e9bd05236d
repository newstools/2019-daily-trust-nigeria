A 22-year-old man, Sani Salisu, of Jabi Motor Park, Abuja, on Wednesday, begged a Karmo Grade I Area Court to reduce his punishment after pleading guilty to criminal trespass and theft charges levelled against him. Before his conviction, Salisu told the court that, “I plead with this court to reduce my punishment for I know I am guilty of all the allegations. “I will suffer so much if you send me to jail. I am so sorry for what I did. Please sir, forgive me and I will not steal again.” The judge, Alhaji Inuwa Maiwada, after listening to Salisu’s appeal for leniency, warned and discharged him. He also ordered him to sign a bond to be of good behaviour and to desist from crime. Maiwada said the complainant’s lack of interest in the matter and Salisu’s plea for clemency, and his being a first time offender, necessitated his verdict. The prosecuting counsel, Mrs. Ijeoma Ukagha, had told the court that one Hussani Salihu, a security guard at ABC Transport, Abuja, reported the matter at the Utako Police Station, Abuja, on February 1, 2019. Mrs. Ukagha said Salisu trespassed into the premises of ABC and stole an air conditioner, a generator radiator, and some items all valued at N500,000. She said Salisu was apprehended by the police and all the stolen items were recovered from him and that he confessed to the police that he stole them. She said the offences contravened Sections 348 and 288 of the Penal Code.
