The Coalition on Conflict Resolution and Human Rights in Nigeria has described as false recent report in the media credited  to Amnesty International that over 60 persons were killed in Rann area of Borno State by members of the Boko Haram insurgents. Amnesty International had in a statement claimed that at least 60 people were killed following the 28 January devastating Boko Haram attack on Rann, a border town in Borno state, northeast Nigeria. However, the human rights group said its investigative tour of the theatre didn’t only reveal that Amnesty International lied, it also showed that INEC’s decision to conduct elections in all the polling units across the north-east was well placed with the realities on ground. The coalition made this known in a preliminary report presented on Monday in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital. The report signed by its President/Convener, Gabriel Oche, urged the Nigerian government to take decisive action against organizations such as Amnesty International. “The group of researchers deployed for on the spot assessment of the various claims as postulated by Amnesty International came up with the verdict that the bulk of the position of Amnesty International is not an accurate reflection of the issues on the ground. The Rann Attacks was amplified and misrepresented to the general public by Amnesty International,” he said.
