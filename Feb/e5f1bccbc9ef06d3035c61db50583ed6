The chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, has said he will not resign over the rescheduled elections earlier billed to hold last Saturday. He disclosed this on Thursday at the National Election Collation Centre located at the International Conference Centre (ICC), Abuja, while addressing stakeholders in his fourth briefing. Reacting to some calls for him to resign over the postponement of the polls, he said he was not under any pressure to resign adding that he has no reason to resign from office. The commission had rescheduled the dates for Presidential and National Assembly elections from February 16 to 23 and Governorship and House of Assembly elections from March 2 to 9 citing logistics issues. “I am not under any pressure. Will I consider resigning? I see no reason to even contemplate resigning. There is no reason whatsoever. The Commission will do the job that is there for us to do,” Yakubu said.
