French warplanes struck a rebel convoy in northern Chad on Sunday, helping local troops repel an incursion across the border from Libya. Mirage jets struck a column of 40 pickups carrying armed groups from Libya deep into Chadian territory, the French army said in a statement. “This intervention at the request of Chadian authorities helped hinder this hostile advance and disperse the column,” it said. The Union of Forces of Resistance (UFR), a rebel Chadian coalition created in 2009 after almost toppling Deby, said it was behind the offensive. CCMSR is a splinter group of the UFR. “The aim is to bring Deby down,” a UFR official said. “We thought France would not intervene in Chad’s internal affairs, but it appears that it is offering no solutions for the Chadian people beyond keeping Deby in power to do their dirty work in the region.” 2000 Chadian forces in Nigeria to fight B/Haram A pastoralist’s rendevouz in N’djamena, Chad Chad holds presidential election as Deby vies to extend rule
