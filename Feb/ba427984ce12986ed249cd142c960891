As the Federal Government, today, inaugurates the first phase of the Lagos â€“ Ibadan standard gauge from Iju, Lagos to Abeokuta, Ogun state, the paramount ruler of Egbaland (Alake of Egbaland), Oba Adedotun Aremu Gbadebo said history is repeating itself in Egbaland. Oba Gbadebo, who arrived the venue of the inauguration in Iju Lagos in company of his high chiefs, told newsmen that since 1900 when the 3,500km narrow gauge line from Lagos to Kano was inaugurated, nothing had been added to the line. But with the inauguration of the 156-kilometer Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge, which covers about 85 kilometers, the paramount ruler said history was repeating itself. Vice President Professor Yemi Osinbajo is expected to inaugurate the rail line from Iju station this morning. According to Oba Gbadebo, the development would transform the entire economic landscape of the Southwest. He said the narrow gauge, which was inaugurated in over 116 years ago, had become obsolete, requiring a modern railway system to cope with the present era. The monarch added that the roads would last longer if goods and cargoes were moved by train. Details later!
