The Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) Worldwide says a win by President Muhammadu Buhari to stay on as president for the next four years is a measure of his acceptability in different parts of the country. Hours after Buhari’s re-election was officially announced, the group’s spokesman, Daniel Dasimaka, issued a statement urging Buhari to “effectively utilize and build on the massive support he and his party received from the Niger Delta in general and the Ijaw nation in particular on his race to re-election by developing the region and Ijaw land.” “This victory affords President Buhari the golden opportunity to write his name in the sand of time in the Niger Delta  by completing projects like the East West road,  Ogoni Clean up,  Brass LNG and Petrochemicals,  Brass Fertilizer, Train 7 of the Bonny LNG,  Bodo-Bonny Road, ending gas flaring, and transforming flared gas to power.” Ijaw youth march for Buhari in Abuja Ijaws caution against violence, congratulate Buhari 2019 polls: Buhari's work, integrity will speak for him – Kachikwu
