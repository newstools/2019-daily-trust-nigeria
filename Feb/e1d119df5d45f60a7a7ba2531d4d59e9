The Aviation Safety Round Table Initiative (ARTI), a group of stakeholders and experts in the aviation industry, yesterday expressed concern over the preparation made for the landing of the helicopter that conveyed Vice President Yemi Osinbajo which crash landed at Kabba, Kogi State on Saturday. The stakeholders however thanked God for sparing the lives of the Vice President and members of his team on board the Agusta AW139 with registration number: 5N-CML operated by Caverton Helicopters. The Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB) is expected to release preliminary report of the incident any moment from now. In a statement yesterday, the aviation roundtable faulted the management of the security of the vice president, saying it was embarrassing that Osinbajo was flown by a foreign pilot. The statement read: “While waiting for the AIB report of the accident, we are disturbed about the preparation made for the landing of the helicopter in that area and the crowd that surged towards the helicopter after the crash, if there had been fire, we would have experienced some casualties. “We are deeply concerned about the management of security  of the Vice President of the Federal Republic of  Nigeria. It is embarrassing to see the Vice President of Nigeria being flown by a foreign pilot whether contracted or chartered in a Nigerian Police helicopter as noticed in a previous flight during these campaign season. “It is a slap on the huge human resource of pilots Nigeria has in abundance”.
