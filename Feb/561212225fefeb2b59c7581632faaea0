The Kwara Development Foundation (KWADEF) has advised voters to take advantage of the poll to exercise their constitutional right to elect their leaders of choice through the ballot box. Kwadef, a non-government organization which embarked on a voters’ sensitization programme in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, enjoined prospective voters to eschew violence and not allow themselves to be used negatively by politicians during the poll. The voters, who expressed their readiness for the poll, advised the group to intensify the enlightenment programme “to open the eyes of the people.” In a post-event press conference, Dr Kolawole Afolabi, the president of the group, explained that the group remained a non-partisan group with non-partisan interest. Afolabi added that the group decided to work towards enacting a focused development paradigm for mobilising the collective strength of the people of Kwara State to achieve sustainable socio-economic growth. According to him, Kwadef was seeking a non-partisan roadmap “to restore deliberate thinking, planning and acting together to restore the glory of Kwara State.”   Group expresses doubt over Kwara LG polls NOA holds North East stakeholders meeting on citizen’s participation Voter apathy, bane of Anambra elections - INEC
