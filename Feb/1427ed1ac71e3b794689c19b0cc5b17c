At least one person has been killed during clashes between supporters of rival politicians ahead of this month’s elections in Senegal. The fighting broke out on Monday in Tambacounda in the east of the country between supporters of the opposition candidate, Issa Sall, and people backing the incumbent Macky Sall. President Sall has accused opposition politicians of instigating the violence.
