Governor Nasiru El-Rufai of Kaduna state, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Isa Ashiru Kudana and other political parties’ governorship candidates in the state on Tuesday signed a peace accord deal to ensure the conduct of free, fair and credible elections. The accord is also aimed at a peaceful transition of political power. The gubernatorial candidates signed the deal at the Kaduna state Police Command Headquarters. The state Commissioner of Police, CP Ahmad Abdulrahman, assured that “Security agents will be firm and fair while discharging their duties” and told the politicians that winning election into public office should not be a desperate task. The CP who called on all and sundry to partner with security agents in ensuring a hitch-free campaign and violence-free elections added, “Violence-free election is a fundamental means to sustainable peace and development.” He said: “Peace Accord signifies our respective commitment to peace and symbolizes respect for the rule of law. “I want to suggest that, candidates and supporters must accept the outcome as announced by the constituted authorities, rather than make trouble because the results are not in one’s favour. “Let us prepare our minds to accept the results for the sake of our dear nation. While those who will emerge as winners must not allow themselves and their supporters when jubilating, to tease and provoke the other sides.” In an interview with journalists shortly after the peace deal, the PDP gubernatorial candidate, Isa Ashiru called on INEC to provide a level playing ground for all political parties during the elections saying, “INEC should play the role of umpire and they should be free and fair to all.” Buhari, Atiku, others to sign another peace accord Past election theft induced widespread violence – El-Rufai 2019 Election: Governor Abubakar, Pate, Bala sign peace accord in Bauchi
