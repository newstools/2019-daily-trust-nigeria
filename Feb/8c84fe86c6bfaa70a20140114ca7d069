The Muslim Council of Nigeria (MCN) in Taraba State has called on Gov. Darius Ishaku to remove the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Mr. Anthony Jellason, over an alleged anti-Islam comment. The acting Chairman of the council, Alhaji Ahmed Bose, who addressed a press conference in Jalingo, said the attention of the council was drawn to an audio recorded by a Hausa musician, Sa’adiya Gombe, who exchanged words with the SSG in which he disparaged Muslims. Alhaji Bose said in the audio, Mr. Jellason allegedly said he hated Islam and Muslims in the state, and so described such comment as “hate speech against the Muslim community.” Bose who is also the state’s Grand Khadi, said the Muslim Council condemned the action of the SSG and called for his immediate removal from his position, as according to him, it would show the Muslim Ummah in the state that his statement did not reflect the position of the state government. “This speech is also contrary to his oath of office as a public office holder as enshrined in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, as amended,” Bose said. However, effort to get the side the SSG was not successful as he refused to answer calls or reply a text message sent to him by our reporter.
