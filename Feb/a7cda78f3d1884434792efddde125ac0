The Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet) has warned of flight cancellations in some airports across the country as dust haze drops visibility to less than 1000 meters. NiMet in a statement yesterday said a considerable amount of dust has been released into the atmosphere over the source region in southern Chad and Niger Republic. NiMet forecast also showed that some of its “stations over the northern parts  of  the  country  are  already  in  hazy conditions  with  visibility  as  low  as  200m  especially  over  northeastern  cities.” It said, “combined with the  dust  already  in suspension  for  the  past  two  days,  further  deterioration  in  horizontal visibilities  to  values  below  1000m  is  expected  especially  over  the northern  parts  of  the  country.” Thus it said, the expected state of the atmosphere in the coming days will likely disrupt flight operations. “Cancellation and delay of flights at some airports across the country are anticipated especially over the northern cities,” the statement noted. NiMet also noted that “users  are  also  advised  to  exercise caution  and  avoid  over  speeding  especially  during the early  morning period  when  horizontal  visibility  is  impaired  by  fog,  mist  or  dust haze.” NiMet advised people allergic to dust to take necessary precautions by reducing their exposure and take their medications to alleviate its effect on their health.
