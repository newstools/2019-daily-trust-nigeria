The governorship candidate of the Alliance for New Nigeria in Ogun State, Ademola Ogunbanjo has said that Nigerians’ ‘resolve’ to vote out President Muhammadu Buhari’s government has not wavered despite the postponement of the Presidential and Parliamentary elections by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Ogunbanjo who spoke with newsmen in Ijebo-Igbo, Ogun, said Nigerians have waited for four years to change Buhari’s government, which he submitted had reneged on “its change promise.” The ANN candidate regretted what he termed broken education, healthcare and infrastructure systems in Nigeria, saying “nothing has worked in the country except chaos.” He also blamed the election shift on external forces, noting that the electoral umpire’s “courage and candor” for demanding another week, deserves commendation. Ogunbanjo said “Whatever the true reason is, the bottom line is, they (INEC) have asked for one more week. We have waited four years to change this government. This government that we thought would bring meaningful change to the people of Nigeria but has disappointed us. “We have waited for four years and one more week, we will wait for. This is because the decision of the people to change this government has not wavered. Our resolution to change this government has not wavered. So, if INEC asked for one more month, we will continue to speak to the people. We will continue to go from places to places, enlightening the minds of our people, helping them understand that this government has to be changed. This government has to be phased out. “We need a government that can lead the people into the 21st century. The government that would be able to compete meaningful with other global system.” Buhari: We won’t accept another election shift Ogun shall rise, says Segun Odegbami, flies ZLP guber ticket Council of State resolves Polls should go on
