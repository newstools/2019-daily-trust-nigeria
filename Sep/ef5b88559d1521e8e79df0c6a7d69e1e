The Centre for Social Justice, Equity and Transparency, CESJET, has showered encomiums on the Director General of the National Emergency Management Agency, NEMA, Mustapha Yunusa Maihaja, for what it called the strengthening of procurement practice and processes in the interest of improving the agency. The centre gave NEMA pat on the back for its strict compliance with the Treasury Single Account (TSA) in compliance with the directive of the Federal Government. CESJET gave the commendations through its Executive Secretary, Isaac Ikpa, at a press conference on Monday in Abuja.

It is not surprising to see companies being dropped from executing projects for the agencies because it submitted misleading or unverifiable information. We have been made to realize that this is to ensure that frauds are prevented before they occur. We have confirmed that this is yielding positive results in blocking leakages,” he said. The centre urged the agency not to be distracted by some elements who are hell bent of rubbishing its efforts.
