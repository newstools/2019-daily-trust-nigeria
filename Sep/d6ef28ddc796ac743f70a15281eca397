The crowd became restive when Governor Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed leaves the Tribunal after appearing as the First Respondent in the case between him and former governor, Mohammed Abdullahi Abubakar. His supporters and that of the former governor hauled verbal assaults, leading to fisticuffs which attracted the attention of the police and other security agents present at the Magistrate Court premises where the Tribunal is sitting.
