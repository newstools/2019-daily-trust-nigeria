Sirika, while admonishing the graduates to put service before everything else, advised that the ability to set priorities will determine the quality of their stewardship. “In accepting to be trained as AVSEC and ARFFS cadets, you must realize that it is a privilege for you to serve your country at this level as the aviation industry is one place where adherence and commitment to rules and standards are applied strictly to the letter,” he said. The managing director of the authority, Captain Rabiu Hamisu Yadudu, advised the graduates to be committed to duty, saying “the career is much more than a job, but a calling.” FAAN graduates 227 aviation security, firefighting personnel FAAN graduates 227 aviation security, firefighters FAAN commissions fresh 216 security, fire fighting officers OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
