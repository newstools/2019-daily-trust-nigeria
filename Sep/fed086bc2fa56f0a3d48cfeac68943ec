Governors of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) under the aegis of Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) have inaugurated the Legislative Programme Steering Committee. The PGF deputy chairman and co-chairman of the committee, Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State, who spoke yesterday at its inaugural meeting, said the team was constituted to impact on the process of strengthening the legislative initiatives of the forum across APC states. Obaseki said the committee would primarily provide PGF members with clear and concise contextual recommendations in terms of legal framework governing government processes and decisions. He said the committee was also expected to promote and advocate the interest of the PGF member states regarding laws, regulations, socio-economic policies and other developments that might affect their states and the APC as a whole.
