Ogun State Internal Revenue Service (OGIRS) has said it generated N15 billion between January and June this year. Chairman of the Service Adekunle Adeosun disclosed this while playing host to members of the State House of Assembly Committee on Finance and Appropriation led byÂ  Olakunle Sobukanla while on a performance appraisal visit on the 2019 budget to the agency. Adeosun stated that the revenue, which translated to 15 per cent of N95 billion budgeted for 2019, was generated from both taxes and licence fees. Other measures put in place on revenue generation, he said, included opening of additional tax units in some strategic locations towards increasing road tax revenue and effective monitoring of commercial road transport workers. He assured that plans were underway to enhance revenue in the subsequent months through the allocation of 2017 and 2018 tax audit jobs to tax monitoring agents (TAMA). Adeosun, however, added that low revenue level could not be unconnected with the 2019 general elections which hindered aggressive tax generation. In his response, Sobukanla advised the agency to deploy more technology to enhance operational efficiency and reduce revenue leakages. The lawmaker explained that the House of Assembly would continue to give maximum support to boost the activities of the agency.
