A Muslim group in Osun State, Al-Ihsan Islamic Welfare Foundation, has presented grinding machines to eight widows to enable them earn income for their sustenance. The widows, selected from Ikirun, Ede, Otatedo and Osogbo, received the machines yesterday at a brief ceremony at Islahudeen Central Mosque, Alekuwodo, Osogbo. The president of the Foundation, Malam Miftah Olayiwola, said the machines were donated by the children of the late Alhaja Suwebat Odunola Ajike Adigun, in remembrance of their mother, who died 10 years ago. OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY Olayiwola appealed to other wealthy people to emulate the gesture of the Adigun family, rather than spend extravagantly on funeral. Top Muslim clerics in the state at the event lauded the Adigun family for donating the machines to the indigent widows through the Foundation. The scholars unanimously cautioned Muslims against begging for alms, saying that no condition should turn any Muslim to a beggar.
