The election petition tribunal sitting in Sokoto, yesterday, upheld the elections of members of the Sokoto State House of Assembly representing Gada East constituency, Kabiru Dauda and Rabah Constituency, Abubakar Zakari. The candidate of the PDP for the March 9, 2019 Gada East constituency polls, Garba Yakubu Tsitse, had challenged the declaration of Dauda of the APC as winner of the election. Similarly, the candidate of the PDP in the March 9, 2019 election for Rabah constituency, Abubakar Gandi, was challenging the declaration of Zakari of APC as winner of the poll. In their respective petitions, they alleged that the respondents did not score the majority of lawful votes cast, and that the elections were not conducted in substantial compliance with the Electoral Act, 2010, as amended, and the INEC Guidelines for the 2019 General Elections. In the judgments, the chairman of the tribunal, Justice Ubale Yusuf, said the petitions lacked merit. He explained that the petitioners failed to prove their cases, and thus dismissed the petitions.
