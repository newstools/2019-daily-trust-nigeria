Elder statesman and Head of Service in Cross River State in the 1980s, Chief Wilfred Inah, has cautioned Governor Ben Ayade against making governance in the state a one-man show. Inah, who spoke with journalists in Calabar, said governance in the state should not be “ad hoc but procedural. “If the governor of a state goes to China and falls in love with the transportation system he finds there, ordinarily, he should not sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), to bring the project to his state without consulting his executive council. “The right procedure is for a governor to find a useful project in China, come back and inform his commissioners, who in turn liaise with the permanent secretaries and directors who are the professionals in the service and a position paper is produced. “In the next State Executive Council meeting, the document will be debated, a decision taken and it becomes a government policy, which all the commissioners are abreast with, because they are part of the decision making. “So if you are in a state and in a whole year, you have just three or four executive council meetings, there is something wrong,” he said Is Ayade biting more than he can chew?
