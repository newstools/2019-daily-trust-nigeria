Inmates of Kafanchan Correctional Service were advised to see their confinement as an avenue to make them better persons. The Coordinator of the National Youth Council of Nigeria, Jema’a Local Government chapter, Comrade Solomon Samuel, gave the advice when he led other members  on a visit to the Nigeria Correctional Service, Kafanchan. Samuel said they should accept their confinement in good faith, noting that some world leaders emerged from prison to international prominence. He assured them that  the Council would continue to identify with them in its  programmes to cushion the effect of their situation. He later donated various household items to the inmates. In a remark the Officer In-Charge, Mathias Dzuzu, thanked the council for the visit and the donation.
