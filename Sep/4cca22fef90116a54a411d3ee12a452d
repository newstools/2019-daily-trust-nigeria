That implies that people are not paying ground rents to the state government. We will change all that,” he said. He said every MDA will henceforth begin to generate revenue for the state government, stressing that gone are the days when MDAs will say they are not revenue generating establishments. Dasogot explained that they were finding it difficult to collect revenue taxes from the informal sector in the state because  streets and houses are not numbered, but that efforts are being made to start numbering and naming the affected streets.
