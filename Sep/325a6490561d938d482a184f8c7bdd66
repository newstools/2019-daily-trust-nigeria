Governor Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa State has warned stakeholders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) against playing into the hands of the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) in their struggle to produce the running mate to Senator Douye Diri, the party’s governorship candidate for the November 16, 2019 governorship election in the state. Governor Dickson, who convened a meeting of the top leadership and critical stakeholders of PDP ahead of the September 23 deadline for candidate substitution in the November 16 gubernatorial election, said in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Fidelis Soriwei, that APC was only banking on violence to win the governorship election. He said the controversy over the running mate was simply normal in politics, stressing that it was not peculiar to the PDP and its candidate in Bayelsa. “I urge all PDP members in Bayelsa to avoid playing into the hands of the opposition APC which carries the heavy burden of an unmarketable gubernatorial candidate,” he said.
