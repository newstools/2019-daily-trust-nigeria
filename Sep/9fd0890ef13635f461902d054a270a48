The Chairman of the FCT Secondary Education Board (SEB) Alhaji Musa Yahaya Muhammad, has called on government and corporate bodies to support girl -child education in the territory. Muhammad made the call at a lecture with the theme “Female Child Education: A Panacea to Social Challenges,” during the celebration of the best graduating student of the University of Abuja, Talatu Adamu, a native of the FCT, yesterday. He said the girl-child education was the only panacea to social challenges, which he attributed to negative cultural beliefs, religious misconceptions as well as poverty. He commended Talatu Adamu for her perseverance and will power to stand out, while pointing out that poverty remains a challenge to female education. The board chairman, however, stressed the need for government to create an enabling environment for the establishment of more schools in the FCT to enable parents enroll their children.
