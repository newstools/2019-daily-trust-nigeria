The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Benue State, yesterday, said its members will participate in the November 30, 2019 election into the 23 local government areas of the state. Acting secretary of the party in the state James Ornguga said the party took the decision following a stakeholders’ meeting organised by the Benue State Independent Electoral Commission (BSIEC) in Makurdi. “The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Benue State wishes to inform her teeming supporters that the party shall not bar potential aspirants from vying for positions in the proposed local government election in the state. “Though the dominant tone at the stakeholders’ meeting suggests that members of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have foreknowledge of the election, and its possible outcomes, our members have gone far in their consultations and it would be unfair stopping them from pursuing their ambitions on our platform at this moment,” he stated.
