Professor Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, Nigeria’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, is set to take office as the President of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). The ceremonies will take place at the UN New York headquarters on September 16th (Monday) and 17th ahead of the high-level week of the UNGA when leaders of the nations of the world take turns to address the General Assembly. A Nigerian government team to the historic event which will be led by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, will include the Director-General of the National Intelligence Agency (NIA), Ambassador Ahmed Rufa’i Abubakar and the Senior Special Assistant, Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu. A statement issued today by Shehu, who is also the Presidential spokesman, said Nigeria’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations is assuming the mantle of leadership with great hopes for the actualization of the major priorities of Nigeria and the African continent. Muhammad-Bande was elected President of the 74th session of the General Assembly by acclamation on Tuesday, June 4, to serve the one-year role with a strong mandate from his home government that nominated him, endorsed by the Group of African States and adopted unanimously by the member-states. The Muhammad-Bande presidency, coming 30 years after this country’s first, presents Nigeria and Africa a unique opportunity to ensure the implementation of the existing mandates for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with particular focus on peace and security, poverty eradication, zero hunger, quality education, climate action and inclusion. The General Assembly under Muhammad-Bande will also play a role in bridging the gaps and promoting collective action to address all international issues that deserve attention, in close coordination and collaboration with the UN Secretary-General, the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council.
