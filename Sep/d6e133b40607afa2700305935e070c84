A 34-year-old woman, Mrs Fatimat Temidayo, has approached a Grade B Customary Court in Akure, Ondo State, to dissolve her 10-year-old marriage to her husband on the ground of infidelity. Temidayo told the court on Friday that the husband, Tajudeen Temidayo, would “go after anything in skirt” and was fond of impregnating young girls. Fatimat, a teacher residing at Alejo Close, Akure, alleged that besides the adultery allegation, Temidayo was constantly beating her and refused to pay the children’s school fees.

He also told my landlady where I sell foodstuffs to send me away from the shop,” she said. Although the 41-year-old respondent admitted to the beating allegation, he also accused his wife of promiscuity. Defending the claim that he slept around with young girls, Temidayo said, “My wife is the cause of that because I confirmed that she is having an affair with one Mr Kola. Her mother was even aware of that and in support of it. My apprentice, Kayode Esan, caught my wife and her lover red-handed on several occasions.” Temidayo didn’t contest Fatimat’s divorce wish. Instead, he prayed the court to grant him custody of the two children from the union, arguing that they might not grow up well “in an environment where the mother is living a promiscuous life.” The president of the court, Chief R.F. Olusanya, adjourned the case till October 14, 2019 for judgment.
