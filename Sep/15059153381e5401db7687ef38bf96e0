The Pension Commission (PenCom) has been urged to consider and incorporate medical needs of retirees, especially in times of emergency. MD/Chief Executive of Interventions and Results Limited, Mr Femi Mokikan, made the call recently in Kano at a one-day interactive symposium held between the Nigerian Employees Consultative Association (NECA) and Pension Commission. Mr Mokikan said it was pathetic to see a retiree in dire need of medical attention, sometimes abroad, while his about N30 million is trapped somewhere. He there called on the commission to device a mechanism through which pensioners could benefit more from their savings while they are still alive. Acting Director General of PenCom, Hajiya Aisha Dahir-Umar, expressed gratitude to NECA for their contribution, and commitment towards the success of the contributory pension scheme (CPS), under the Pension Reform Act (2014). She said the Buhari administration had, in March this year, launched a micro pension plan with the view to expanding the coverage and benefits of CPS to the self-employed and persons operating in the informal sector. The Director General of NECA, Dr Timothy Olawale, represented by Dr Mahmud Othman, said the essence of the meeting was to enlighten the employers on the current developments and challenges in the implementation of the Pension reform Act. He urged employers to comply with the provision of the pension Act and ensure prompt and complete remittance to the CPS. He also called on the participants to cascade down the knowledge they would acquire at the meeting to the members of their respective organizations.
