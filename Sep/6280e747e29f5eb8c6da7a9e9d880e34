Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State said yesterday that the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) reported that the 22.6 million barrels of crude oil valued at approximately $1.35 billion was lost during the first half of this year. Obaseki said this while speaking with journalists after the National Economic Council (NEC) meeting on the report of a 13-member adhoc-committee he chaired to address the impact of vandalization, oil theft, and illegal bunkering on oil production. He said the adhoc-committee reported that the governance structure of the pipeline was in a situation whereby no one was held accountable whenever there were bridges and when such losses occured. Obaseki said its committee also discovered that the slow and inadequate prosecution of thieves despite numerous arrests and seizures had continued to encourage the menace. He said the absence of petroleum products filling stations in most of the oil producing communities around the Niger Delta made them resort to illegal bunkering and illegal refineries. The governor of Edo State said the committee recommended among others that there should be special courts to try offenders and also have a special legal task force to coordinate the prosecution of arrested offenders as well as trained special judges to handle cases of oil theft. He said the committee also advised that NNPC should be encouraged to engage with the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) to identify the markets for stolen petroleum products across the continent.
