A baby boy, suspected to be a month old, has been found abandoned in the bush in Abaji. A resident, only identified as Ibrahim, said a farmer found the baby wrapped in a cloth last Friday in a bush behind the Sharia Court in the area while going to his farm. He said the baby was drenched by the early morning downpour in the area.

I wonder why some women are heartless, if not, why not keep the baby where people can easily see it instead of in the bush,” he said. When contacted, the Abaji Divisional Police Officer (DPO), CSP Umar Musa, said he was alerted that a baby boy was found dumped in the bush behind the Sharia Court in the area. He said police officers were deployed to the scene and conveyed the child to officials of the social welfare department of the area council, adding that they were investigating the incident. “But I am not aware that the baby has died if not now that you are telling me but I will find out from the social welfare department,” he added.
