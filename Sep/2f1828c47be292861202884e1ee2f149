An Islamic scholar and former Commissioner for Home Affairs in Lagos State, Dr. Abdul Hakeem Abdullateef, yesterday said the xenophobic attacks in South Africa may not end as the South African would eventually turn against themselves after driving out foreigners. Abdullateef, while delivering a Juma’at sermon at the Lagos Secretariat Central Mosque in Alausa, Lagos, said even if the South Africans succeeded in chasing out foreigners, they would still fight themselves along ethnic and religious lines. He said ethnicity, tribalism and discrimination on the basis of religious beliefs is a crime and should be avoided in all ramifications. He said the situation in South Africa is very unfortunate and advised that Nigeria must also guard against it by shunning ethnicity and tribalism. He added that what is paramount is humanity in every individual, noting that human beings were created to complement one another. “In Nigeria, we sing the songs of war every day. We talk about division every day. What is happening in South Africa will be endless. What do I mean? If they succeed in driving out every foreigner, then they will begin ethnicity at the local level because it is a monster,” he said. According to him, people should allow the federal government to handle the issue with diplomacy as they are currently doing.
