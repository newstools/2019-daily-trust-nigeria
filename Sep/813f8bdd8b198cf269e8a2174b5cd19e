The President of Nigeria’s leading capital market awards, PEARL Awards Nigeria, Mr. Tayo Orekoya (FCA), has described the performance of the capital market as still relatively unstable; saying the market performance has nose-dived in the recent past due to decline in stock and bond investments occasioned by divest of stocks by foreign and local investors. Mr. Orekoya said this while addressing newsmen ahead of the 2019 edition of PEARL Awards scheduled to hold on November 24, at the Eko Hotels and Towers in Lagos. He said PEARL Awards fully supported the sensitisation initiatives of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) through the ongoing market data workshop series and the various initiatives from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the engagement of relevant stakeholders on the 10-year capital market master plan. “It is, however, our considered opinion that the master plan should be holistically reviewed as a result of current economic realities in Nigeria,” he said, reiterating that PEARL Awards remained committed to partnering with the regulatory authorities and other stakeholders towards achieving sustainability, growth and deepening of the market. He, however, stressed the need for the SEC and the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) to do more towards investor education to rebuild confidence in the market.
