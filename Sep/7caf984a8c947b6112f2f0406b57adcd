A magistrate court in Owerri, Imo State has summoned a former governor of the state, Rochas Okorocha, over allegation of incitement. The governor is to appear on October 8, this year. The Imo State government had dragged Okorocha to court over accusation that the former governor had been inciting his supporters to disobey the government. In the suit, with reference no: OW/MISC.79/2019, filed at the Owerri district of the Magistrate Court, the Imo State Attorney General on behalf of the state government alleged that Okorocha had been in the habit of making seditious and inciting statements against the government even on air using his radio station (Reach FM). The attorney general also alleged that Okorocha, even as an elected senator, spent more time in Owerri, cavorting with his retinue of well-armed thugs and urchins referred to as ‘Ohaji Boys’ whom he employed to cause trouble. The state government had alleged that an aide to Governor Emeka Ihedioha was beaten to a pulp while on a legitimate assignment of serving court processes at Okorocha’s Spibat residence.
