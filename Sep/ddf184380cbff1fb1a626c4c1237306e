The panel investigating allegations of gross misconduct against the deputy governor of Kogi State, Elder Simon Achuba, has adjourned its hearing to October 3 and 4, 2019. The adjournment came, yesterday, after lead counsel to the complainant, Anthony Adeniyi, had called all their eight witnesses to testify and be cross examined before the seven-man panel. Testifying before the panel at its resumed hearing, yesterday, the Director General, Media and Publicity to the governor, Kingsley Fanwo, accused the deputy governor of inciting the people against the governor through his allegations. Fanwo made the allegation while being led in evidence by the lead counsel to the State House of Assembly, Mr Anthony Adeniyi. He said Achuba’s allegation that the governor was “waging violence against the people of Kogi State was a direct incitement against the governor and the government of Kogi State.” Lead counsel to the respondent, Jibrin Okutepa, asked for a two-week adjournment in view of the forthcoming International Bar Association conference coming up in South Korea. The chairman of the panel, Mr John Baiyeshea, after consulting with both parties, adjourned to October 3 and 4 for the respondent to present its witnesses before it.
