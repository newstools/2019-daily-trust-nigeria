Nigeria can attract more foreign investors in the mining sector when it has accurate geoscience data and information, the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, Dr Abdulkadir Muazu, has said. He told would-be mining investors at an investment roundtable recently at the Africa Downunder 2019 Conference in Perth, Australia, where he spoke on the National Integrated Mineral Exploration Project (NIMEP) embarked upon by the federal government to provide geo-science information for investors. In a statement, Muazu said although Nigeria is not yet recognised as a mining destination, the country is very keen and committed to becoming one, hence the NIMEP project which will give investors accurate data to help guide them in mining investments in the country. The Director General, Nigeria Geological Survey Agency (NGSA), Dr Abdulrazaq Garba, who was also at the meeting said Nigeria has a history of geological survey that is 100 years old but the issue of investing in geoscience data had been lacking.
