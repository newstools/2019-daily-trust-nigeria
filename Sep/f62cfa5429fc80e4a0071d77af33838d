The National/State Assembly Election Tribunal sitting in Makurdi on Tuesday ordered a fresh election in five polling units of the Gboko West Constituency in order to determine the winner of the polls. Daily Trust reports that APC’s Terhemba Chabo had taken his PDP opponent, Terna Achir, to the tribunal after he was declared as winner of the election by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Chabo challenged the election of Achir on account that the margin of win was less than the number of votes cancelled.
