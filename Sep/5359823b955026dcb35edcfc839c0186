No fewer than 2,000 women have benefited from the ‘Okowo Dapo’, a loan empowerment scheme of the Ogun State government. Governor Dapo Abiodun, who launched the initiative at the June 12 Cultural Centre, Kuto, Abeokuta,  implored the beneficiaries not to see the empowerment programme as their own share of the national cake, but an avenue for economic empowerment through which they would be gainfully employed, improve their productivity, increase their income and also become employers of labour. Describing the sustainability of the programme as a bilateral responsibility, the governor added that government had played its own part by providing the funding. Abiodun urged the beneficiaries to reciprocate the gesture by ensuring that the funds were utilized for the purpose meant. “Our  administration is irrevocably committed to providing focused and qualitative governance that will create an enabling environment for public-private sector partnership (PPP) which is fundamental to the creation of an enduring economic development and individual prosperity for the people of the  state,” the governor stated. He added that it was the demonstration of the commitment of his government to make life more meaningful for the people that would encourage the private sector to partner with the state.
