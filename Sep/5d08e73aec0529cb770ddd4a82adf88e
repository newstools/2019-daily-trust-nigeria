Open Fees Educational Aid Foundation, an NGO, has organised a multi-stakeholders’ forum to find ways of helping thousands of poor students have access to and pay for basic education. The forum, which will hold at Valencia Hotel, Abuja, on Thursday, is being hosted in collaboration with Malala Fund, Give Girls a Chance, Child and Youth Protection Foundation and other development partners, according to a statement by the organisation. “Currently, one out of every five out-of-school children is a Nigerian child”. The Federal Government’s free basic education programme does not cover children throughout secondary school. “It ends at Junior Secondary School after which students have to pay their way for the next three years”, a statement by the foundation said.
