Omolade said, “The flood covered me up to my chest while I was trying to rescue some engines that customers brought to me for repair.” At Onirodunu, Baruwa area, the flood entered living apartments, which caused people living in the area to leave their homes. A resident, Alhaj Moshood Adigun, wondered how the flood affected his house as it was not close to the river.
