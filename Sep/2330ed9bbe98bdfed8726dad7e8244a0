The FCT police commissioner, Bala Ciroma, has advised students to stay away from  drug abuse and cultism. He gave the advise, yesterday, in Abuja during a campaign against cultism and drug abuse organised for FCT secondary schools students by the FCT Police Community Relations Committee (PCRC) in collaboration with the FCT police command. He called on the students to embrace discipline and avoid peer influence and other distractions that would hinder them from achieving their aspirations in life. “As you are in secondary school now, your next aspiration is to go to university but if you join bad gangs, you will begin to do wrong things that can result in you dropping out of school,” he cautioned the students. The CP said cultism has the tendency of getting a person killed, which, he said, has always been the case when there was a clash between rival cult groups. “And the consequences of being a cultist are that, you may end up losing your life and since most activities of cultists are criminal, it could result in prosecution,” he said. Ciroma also cautioned students against drug addiction, adding that it could also lead to criminal prosecution where the addict could not provide resources to satisfy his desire. “If you don’t have the resources to finance such habit, the next thing is to start finding ways to meet up by looking for your parents’ purse,” he added. In his remarks, the FCT command chairman of the PCRC, Chief Bolaji Adigun, advocated for a training workshop during orientation for new students on the dangers of cultism. He called on parents to ensure close monitoring of children and also called on religious bodies to ensure they organise a forum to enable youths to air their challenges.
