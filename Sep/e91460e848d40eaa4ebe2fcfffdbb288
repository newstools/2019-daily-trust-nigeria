The people of Umuokwara Nwaneri of Isiozi aka in Njaba Local Government Area of Imo State have expressed worry over the whereabouts of the exhumed corpses of two members of the community, Mrs. Esonma Anopuomee and her daughter-in-law, Margaret Anopuomee. The two, who died in 2016 and 2017, respectively, were buried on September 4, following long years of land tussle between the Anopuomee and Augustine Nnanyereugo families. The bodies were exhumed on September 24 by members of Nnanyereugos family over claims that the land that they were buried belonged to them.

The action drew anger and rage from members of the community, who carried the bodies and deposited in the sitting room of the Nnanyereugos. However, members of the communities are now in a quandary over where the Nnanyereugos deposited the bodies as they have refused to disclose their whereabouts. Leader of the community, Rev (Dr.) Richard Ikechukwu, told our correspondent in an interview on Friday that all efforts to recover the exhumed bodies have been unsuccessful as the Nnanyereugo family has refused to yield grounds. He said a meeting called by the elders of the community did not yield much fruit as the families have continued in their contestation over the rightful owner of the disputed piece of land. Ikechukwu said: “As I am talking to you now, we don’t know where the two bodies are because angry youths removed them from the market square and dumped them in the living room of Mr. Nnanyereugo. We are meeting to resolve the issue and it is after the meeting that I can speak authoritatively on what action the community intends to take on the burning issue.” Community cries out over whereabouts of exhumed corpses Missing General: Community buried body secretly – Army When the living live on the dead
