The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to vacate office over a video in which the minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, pleaded with Nigerians to pardon the president over his alleged false WAEC certificate claim. The PDP argued that the video was an admission of guilt and a ploy to appeal to sentiments, seeing that the president had allegedly failed to defend himself before the presidential petitions tribunal. The party insisted that it was immaterial whether the video was doctored or the minister made the statement in 2015, as claimed. Addressing a press conference, the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the video was pushed into the public space, “to influence the mind of the tribunal to bend the law after solid evidence have been presented before it” against the president.
