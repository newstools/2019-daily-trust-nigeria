The National Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal sitting in Owerri, yesterday, nullified the election of Mr. Obinna Onwubuariri as member representing Isiala Mbano/Onuimo/Okigwe federal constituency of Imo State. Onwubuariri, a member of the PDP was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2015. The tribunal ruled that there was merit in the petition filed by Princess Miriam Onuoha, of APC. Chairman of the panel, Justice R. Harriman, ordered INEC to conduct a fresh poll in the federal constituency within 90 days from the date of the judgment. The panel also ordered the withdrawal of the certificate of return issued to Onwubuariri. The tribunal said INEC and the first respondent were unable to defend the allegations of over voting, mutilation of figures, reduction of the petitionerâ€™s votes preferred against them by the petitioner. Harriman said the declaration of the lawmaker who is a member of the PDP was done in utter disregard of the electoral act, as amended.
