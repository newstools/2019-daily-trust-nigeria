The Ohinoyi of Ebiraland, Dr. Ado Ibrahim, has urged women in Kogi State to unite and speak with one voice in order to put an end to violence and intimidation against them in elections. Dr. Ibrahim gave the advice at his palace in Okene over the weekend when a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), Challenged Parenthood Initiative (CPI), paid him an advocacy visit ahead of the governorship election slated for November 16. He described women as nation builders who should be treated with respect and given equal opportunity in the political space.

The Ohinoyi, while condemning violence before, during and after elections in Nigeria, said it was high time politicians put aside the “must win” syndrome kind of politics and adopt a model whereby the voice of electorate would be reflected through the ballot. He eulogised Nigerian women for their roles in home and nation building, adding that the time was ripe for them to come together with one voice and participate in active politics. Earlier, the Executive Director of CPI, Eunice Abimbola Agbogun, told the monarch that her organisation, in collaboration with the National Democratic Institute (NDI) and USAID, had been championing the campaign to put an end to victimisation of women during elections. Agbogun pointed out that CPI had visited various stakeholders, including political parties and traditional institutions, with the aim of accomplishing its “Get out the Vote (GOTV)” programme targeted at ensuring active participation in the forthcoming gubernatorial election in Kogi State.
