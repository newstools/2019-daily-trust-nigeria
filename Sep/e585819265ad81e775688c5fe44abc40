National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has given reasons why the ruling party will win the forthcoming governorship elections in Bayelsa and Kogi states. Tinubu, who spoke yesterday in Benin during the 90th birthday celebration of the Esogban of Benin, Chief David Edebiri, said APC would win the elections because all stakeholders would work in unison, like the bunch of brooms that swept the debris of the past for a better Nigeria. “What I expect in Bayelsa and Kogi is victory. There is no other party in the states…politics is a market of many branches and this is the broom; the broom will come together as a bunch to sweep all the debris of the past. That is it, and we are going to win the election,” he said. OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY Speaking on complaints that Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State did not perform, the APC national leader said democracy would not exist if there were no complaints in politics. He urged Nigerians not to pay attention to what he described as noise in the market, saying “there are many apples, oranges and various fruits of different character. But one thing that is consistent is the broom that will come together as a bunch during the election.” On his part, the National Chairman of APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, tasked politicians on the need to always speak the truth, stressing that it was possible to get desired position in politics without bending the truth. He said many politicians started well by telling the truth to get power but at old age, due to one challenge or the other, deviated. He described the celebrant, Chief David Edebiri, as a personality that always speaks the truth.
