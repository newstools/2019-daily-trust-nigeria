Mrs Oluwatosin Somefun, the Managing Director of Unity Bank Plc, has decried the high level of unemployment in the country. Somefun noted that the constant upsurge in the turnout of graduates on a yearly basis without availability of jobs or opportunities has given birth to frustrated and under-engaged youths in the country. She made the remarks while delivering the 11th convocation lecture of Redeemer’s University in Ede, Osun. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the lecture was entitled:” Unleashing Youth Potentials: Pathway to Nigeria’s Future.” Somefun said that as a result of high rate of unemployment in the country, there had been constant increase in the number of youths involved in criminal activities. “The average Nigerian parent or guardian sacrifices a lot to ensure that their children get an education to become independent and contribute to the growth of the society. “But a good number of them remain dependent on their parents, even after completion of education,” Somefun said. She, called on government to place greater premium on youth development and preservation by providing good leadership, quality education and an enabling environment for job creation in both private and public sectors.
