One person was said to have died while many were severely injured when members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) engaged one another in a brawl on Sunday at Yaya Abatan, Ogba, Lagos. Operatives of the Lagos State Task Force said they arrested 11 suspected members of the union for allegedly causing the mayhem. The suspects, according to the task force, allegedly engaged one another in a fight with axes, broken bottles and clubs. Daily Trust gathered that the fracas started over sharing of money that one of the union leaders had given the NURTW members. The fight, which lasted for several hours, caused a gridlock on the long Yaya Abatan stretch as commercial bus drivers made frantic u-turn to avoid being trapped in the battle.  It was learnt that the deceased was stabbed in the neck and bled to death before help came his way. The Chairman of the Lagos State Task Force, Olayinka Egbeyemi, confirmed the incident and the arrest, adding that the suspects were immediately charged before the State Mobile Court. Egebyemi said that dangerous weapons like axes, broken bottles and cutlasses were recovered from those arrested in connection with the mayhem. In a statement he issued, the Task Force Chairman warned all members of the NURTW across the state to always conduct their activities in a peaceful manner as anyone caught fomenting trouble would be severely dealt with in accordance with the law.
