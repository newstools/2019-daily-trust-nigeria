A 24-year-old man, Okafor Ikechukwu, has been dragged before an Akure magistrate court, Ondo State, for alleged armed robbery. Ikechukwu was said to have committed the offence on August 24, 2019 at about 8.56pm at Great Pamax filling station, Adegbola junction, Akure. The prosecutor, Sergeant Taiwo Oniyere, told the court yesterday that the defendant and others now at large armed themselves with guns, cutlasses and other offensive weapons to rob Aanuoluwapo Ojo, Olayemi Oluwatosin and Joseph Victor of the sum of N140,385. Ikechukwu pleaded not guilty to the charges levelled against him. Oniyere moved for the remand of the accused person in prison custody, pending legal advice from the office of the Ondo State Director of Public Prosecution. But the defence counsel, Mr Femi Adetoye, opposing the remand application, told the court that his client was wrongly accused. Adetoye said Ikechukwu was a farmer going to his farm when he was arrested as one of the robbers. The lawyer said no exhibit was recovered from him, and that the nominal complainant had even declared he was no longer interested in the case. He, therefore, prayed the court to grant his client bail in the most liberal terms, and promised he would provide a reliable and reasonable surety. The magistrate, Mrs J. Adepoju, ruled that there was no confessional statement on any exhibit recovered from Ikechukwu. Consequently, she granted him bail in the sum of N250,000, with one surety in the like sum. The magistrate adjourned the case to October 16, 2019 for hearing and legal advice.
