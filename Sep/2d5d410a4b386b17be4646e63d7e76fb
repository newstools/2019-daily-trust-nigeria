Residents of Wurma in Kurfi Local government area, Katsina State, have secured the release of the 27 persons kidnapped after an attack on the village by bandits on August 26. A source told Arewa Trust Weekly that only one person, Mohammed Jibril, is yet to be released after the bandits have placed a N1 million ransom on him. “We have paid close to N6 million to secure their release. As you know the victims were divided into groups, and a ransom of N1.3 million, N1.5 million and N2 million, respectively, was paid,” the source said. “The money was raised from donations and contributions by individuals. “We are appealing to them, giving the ongoing peace meeting with the governor, to release him as well,” another source said It could be recalled that the Village Head, Mustapha Muhammad, had appealed to well-meaning persons to help secure the release of the abducted persons. He said many of those kidnapped could not afford to pay the ransom being demanded because they are poor. A total of 49 persons were whisked away after the attack although  16 were later abandoned by the bandits.
