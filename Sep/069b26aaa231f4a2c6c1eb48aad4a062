The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kebbi, says the party has unanimously adopted consensus selection for candidates in the Oct. 26, Local Government Council election in the state. The Public Relations Officer of the party, Alhaji Sani Dododo, made this known after an emergency stakeholders’ meeting of the party in Birnin Kebbi. “The record of our register shows that over 800 aspirants have shown and expressed their interests to contest in the election under our  platform. “Over 300  of our members aspire for Chairmanship position while 500 aspire for Councillorship under our party’s platform,” he said. Dododo said the APC structured the state into six zones, adding that six committees were set up by the party to handle the consensus in the zones. “We are committed to safeguarding the interest and peace of our party, hence we opted for the consensus, and we believe it will be fair for all our aspirants in the state. ” The party will, equally, give opportunity to  new entrants from other parties to contest in the election, ” he said. The PRO debunked rumour that the party gave automatic waver to some aspirants in the state. “It has come to our knowledge that some aspirants are there showing their supporters expression of interests form that the party has endorsed them. “It is bogus and unfounded as we will not do anything outside our party’s constitution which spells clearly on consensus and primary election, not just direct waver,” he said.
