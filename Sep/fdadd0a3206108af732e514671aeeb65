Fifteen Akwa Ibom communities across eight local government areas of the state have received N148 million from the Agency for Community and Social Development Project (CSDP) for development projects. Presenting the cheques to benefiting communities yesterday in Uyo, the Commissioner for Economic Development and Ibom Deep Seaport, Mr. Akan Okon, said the disbursement was the first milestone for the execution of live touching projects in rural communities within the state. Okon said the agreement would be signed by the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Uwemedimo Nwoko, to serve as a legal commitment in the execution of the projects. He said the Akwa Ibom State government contributed its counterpart fund for the projects before the World Bank released the money and advised members of the Community Development Committee of each community to be prudent with the money. He recalled that 25 communities have already benefitted from CSDP projects and assured that there would be more beneficiaries.
