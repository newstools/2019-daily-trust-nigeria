The election petition tribunal sitting in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, yesterday, sacked Lazarus Ogbee of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) representing Ezza South/Ikwo federal constituency. The tribunal declared the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as the winner of the February 23 National Assembly election. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had declared Ogbee as the winner with 31,296 votes against 27,700 votes scored by Ogah of APC. But dissatisfied with the results, Ogah proceeded to the tribunal, alleging that his votes were cancelled in some of the polling units and wards, hence he prayed the court that he should be declared winner. The tribunal, which restored the said cancelled votes by lNEC, declared  Ogah as the winner of the election. Chairman of the tribunal, Justice Sika Henry Aprioku, ruled that from the evidences presented before the tribunal, Ogah scored 36,238 votes, while the PDP candidate got 33,263. “It is the petitioner that scored the majority of the lawful votes having scored 36,238 votes as against the PDP candidate, the first respondent, who scored 33,263 votes. “We entirely agreed with the petitioner that he scored the majority of lawful votes from our own computation. “The certificate of return issued to the 1st respondent by the 3rd respondent (INEC) as representing Ezza South/Ikwo federal constituency is hereby withdrawn forthwith and must be issued to the petitioner, Chinedu Ogah,” the tribunal ruled. Speaking to journalists shortly after the ruling, counsel to the first respondent, Barr. Roy Umahi, said they will challenge the ruling.
