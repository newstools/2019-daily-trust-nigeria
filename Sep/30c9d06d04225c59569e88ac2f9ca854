Gunmen kidnapped 18 passengers along the Otan/Imesi-Ile road in Osun State on Sunday night.  It was gathered that the kidnapping was carried out in connivance with one of the occupants in the bus, who disguised as a passenger. The driver and occupants of the commercial bus, who were said to be travelling from Osogbo to Abuja, were kidnapped at Ajeoku Junction, Otanle\Imesile expressway on Sunday night. The passengers were said to have been whisked into the forest and no contacts have been made with the family members of the victims. Confirming the incident, the Osun Police Public Relations Officer, Folashade Odoro, said the total number of the victims could not be ascertained yet. “For now, we cannot confirm the number of people, who were kidnapped until we get feed back from our officers. “But I can tell you that we are on top of the situation and all the kidnapped persons will be rescued,” Odoro said. The PPRO, however, in a text message later sent to NAN, confirmed that four of the victims had been rescued at the time of filing this report. Odoro called on the people of the state to promptly report any suspected movement to the police.
