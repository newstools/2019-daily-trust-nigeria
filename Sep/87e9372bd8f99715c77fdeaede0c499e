The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arraigned a businessman, Babagana Abba Dalori, before an FCT High Court for alleged fraud. Dalori and his company, Galaxy Transportation and Construction Services Ltd, were taken to the court on four separate charges bordering on the alleged fraud, but he took plea on Monday in three out of the four. The EFCC filed a total of 12 count-charges against Dalori on allegations of obtaining sums ranging from N500, 000 to N95.5m for purposes of buying and selling special trips of excavated sands in October, 2017.

His lawyer, Mohammed Monguno Esq. applied for his bail to be heard during vacation, informing the court that he has been held since March 29, adding that two different courts have ordered for his release on bail which the EFCC have failed to comply with. “The entirety of the transaction is purely a civil matter. If the court be minded to hear our bail application during vacation, we apply that it be served on counsel here and now because EFCC is always evading service,” Monguno said. Justice Muawiyah Baba Idris adjourned the case to Wednesday September 4 for hearing of the bail application.
