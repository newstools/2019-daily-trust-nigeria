The Elections Petitions Tribunal, sitting in Sokoto has dismissed the petition challenging the emergence of  Bello Isa Ambarura as winner of the March 9, 2019,  Illela Constituency election. Ambarura is the House Leader of the Sokoto State House of Assembly. The candidate of the PDP for the constituency election, Hon Dayyabu Adamu Kalmalo, filed the petition against Ambarura of the APC, claiming that Ambarura was not duly elected by the majority of lawful votes cast. Delivering his judgement, Justice I. Iwodi pointed out that burden of proof of the allegations made by the petitioners rested on them but that they presented hearsay as evidence. He said the petitioners failed to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt.
