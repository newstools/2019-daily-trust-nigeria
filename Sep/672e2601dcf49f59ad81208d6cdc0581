The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) in Adamawa has threatened to withdraw operating licences from five filling stations for sabotage. It accuses them of sabotaging efforts to improve the standard of living and economy in Adamawa and cheating the economy. The stations include Makeri, Magaso, MRS, AA Salish & Sons and Oando. Acting controller of DPR, Laminga Mohammed, already sealed five stations during a routine monitoring in Adamawa south local government area. It accused staff of the stations of under-dispensing, describing it as theft and robbery. “I wonder why people engage in this unholy practices to make money. Without criminally adjusting your dispensing pump, You can still make good profit, so why cheating people of their hard earn money?,” he said. “In this filling station based on the meter we tested now, if you buy 10 litres you get only eight litres, so you lost two litres, it is unacceptable,” he said. He called on the public and motorist to report any dubious and sharp practices they notice in any filling station for a prompt action and solicited for the cooperation of the general public in dealing with such practices.
