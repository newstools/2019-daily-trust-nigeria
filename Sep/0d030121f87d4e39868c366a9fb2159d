The House of Representatives Committee Chairman on Aviation, Nnolim Nnaji, has urged the Federal Government through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to get in touch with the South African authorities to address the hiccups being experienced by Air Peace in the evacuation of Nigerians. Even though the Chairman of Air Peace, Mr. Allen Onyema, said he offered to bring back all Nigerians willing to return home free of charge, the committee chairman urged the Federal Government to assist the management of Air Peace in defraying the huge operational cost of airlifting the over 700 Nigerians back to the country. Mr. Onyema had in the wake of the xenophobic attacks intervened by deploying one of the 777 aircraft in Air Peace fleet to bring back Nigerians, saying he was touched by the magnitude of the violence unleashed on them.  The airline is expected to spend about N300m on the operations, it was learnt. Analysis by Daily Trust show that the airline may spend more in fueling the aircraft,  paying airport charges (landing, parking, over flight) at the O R Tambo International Airport, Johannesburg, and paying the crew. “Considering that the flight is not a scheduled operation, some of these charges would be higher than the normal charges,” an expert who spoke in confidence said. Our correspondent reports that a return ticket from Lagos to South Africa costs from N157,000 to N167,000. But the lawmaker hailed the gesture by Onyema which he described as “very patriotic” and said with that singular act, Chief Onyema had demonstrated “true spirit of Africanism which compels us to be our brother’s keeper.” You're worthy son, community tell Air Peace chairman Xenophobia: Don’t pay for evacuation flight from S/Africa, Air Peace tells Nigerians Home-bound Nigerians held in South Africa as 187 return OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
