President Muhammadu Buhari has mourned the passing of a staff, Buhari Nalado Sandamu, who served him and his family for more than 30 years. President Buhari said in a statement issued yesterday by his Senior Special Assistant (Media & Publicity) Malam Garba Shehu that he had “lost a good and honest caretaker”. The president, who offered prayers for the repose of his house keeper who was better known as ‘commander’, said, “I have lost a prudent and a wonderful custodian who did so well taking care of my country home in Daura. May Allah bless his soul and give strength to his family to bear this irreparable loss, Ameen.” The president sent a delegation to the family of the deceased in Sandamu Local Government Area, Katsina, comprising Senior Special Assistant, Domestic and Household Matters, Sarki Abba, Senior Special Assistant, Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu and State Chief of Protocol, Amb. Lawal Kazaure. The president’s housekeeper, Saleh Yuguda, was also on the delegation that visited the family of the bereaved.
