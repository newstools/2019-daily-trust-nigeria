The China brand show will make its West African debut as part of the Retail Sourcing Fair (RSF) event in the second half of this year, with visitors expected from a wide variety of industries. A release, yesterday, from the event’s Project Director, Bunmi Aliyu, stated that the three-day RSF international trade show, beginning from November 12, 2019 in Lagos, would attract over 400 companies and exhibit the latest manufactured goods from more than nine countries. “The growth of Retail Sourcing Fair is the result of increased interest among the Nigerian and West African public in manufacturing and importing retail products, as well as the general growth of international trade of higher quality, ethically-manufactured products,” said Aliyu.
