His refusal degenerated into a quarrel between him and another driver. “As they started exchanging blows, one brought out a substance suspected to be a charm and hit the other one. The latter fell immediately and became unconscious. Efforts to revive him proved abortive.” The Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti Command, Caleb Ikechukwu, who confirmed the development said, “We heard that it was a clash between two drivers and one of them was said to have hit the deceased with a substance suspected to be a charm and  he died. “Due to the fact that a life was lost, it escalated, but the Commissioner of Police, Mr Asuquo Amba, quickly drafted more men to the area and normalcy has been restored.” Ikechukwu said the principal suspect had been arrested, while investigation into the case has commenced. 1 died, 13 arrested in students, transport workers clash in Niger – Police Big money, big trouble: The story of Nigeria’s multi-billion naira transport union Drivers protest over colleague’s arraignment for rudeness to Fayose
