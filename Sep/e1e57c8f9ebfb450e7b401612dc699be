A proper component of the Know Your Customer (KYC) backed by biometric identity verification will help curb cybercrime in financial services space, the Managing Director, Chief Executive Officer of VerifyMe Nigeria, Esigie Aguele, has said. Aguele who commended the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) for recognizing September 16 as Nigeria’s National Identity Day, described the move as a welcome development in Nigeria’s quest to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 16.9, which aims at providing legal identity for everyone, including birth registration by 2030. This he said would help strengthen Nigeria’s financial sector in the areas of financial inclusion and combating identity fraud. “It’s really gratifying to see NIMC taking very strong initiatives to document Nigerians because it is a key indicator that will enable government become more precise in the provision of essential amenities and services for the citizenry. We are also excited because the gains will trickle down to the financial services sector, especially in highlighting the importance of integrating biometric ID verification as a key component of the Know Your Customer (KYC) process adopted by lenders operating,” he said.
