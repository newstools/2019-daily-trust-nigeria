The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has said inflation rate in August, 2019, reduced by 0.06 per cent to 11.02 per cent from 11.08 per cent recorded in July. NBS said this in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) of August, 2019, report it released yesterday in Abuja, but said inflation increased by 11.02 per cent (year-on-year) in August, 2019. “Accordingly, disinflation continued in August, 2019, despite several pronouncements regarding restrictions on the import of some food items, minimum wage and the recent borders closure. “It is important to note that with respect to the latter, the borders were only closed on August 20, 2019, with only 11 days of 31 days for any significant impact to be felt either way on prices,” NBS said in the report. It further said the inflation rate was also the average price for the whole month and not only the prices of goods and services in the last few days of the month. It added that the harvest season and existing weak consumer demand and their natural effect to slow down food and other prices also played a major role in determining the direction of the inflation. “Against this backdrop, in August, 2019, all major indices slowed except urban inflation year-on-year. “On month-on-month basis, the headline index increased by 0.99 per cent in August. This is 0.02 per cent rate lower than the rate recorded in July – 1.01 per cent,” it said. According to the NBS, the percentage change in the average composite CPI for the 12 months period ending August over the average of the CPI for the previous 12 months period is 11.27 per cent, showing 0.02 per cent point from 11.29 per cent recorded in July. (NAN) It also said the urban inflation rate increased by 11.48 per cent (year-on-year) in August from 11.43 per cent recorded in July, while the rural inflation rate increased by 10.61 per cent in August from 10.64 per cent in July.
