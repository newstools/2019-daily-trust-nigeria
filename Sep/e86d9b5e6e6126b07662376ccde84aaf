The crisis rocking the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kogi State has deepened as an aggrieved aspirant in the recent governorship primaries, Alhaji Abubakar Mohammed Ibrahim, has gone to court seeking to be declared the candidate of the party. He said this on Wednesday in Abuja at a press conference. The spokesman of Abubakar Ibrahim campaign organisation, Shaba Ibrahim, who briefed reporters, faulted the processes that produced Engr. Musa Wada as candidate of the party. “We, as democratic and law-abiding people, have taken steps to seek redress within the confines of the law. We have approached the court to seek redress and it is because this matter is not otherwise subjudiced, we will not go into further details. But suffice to state that we have won and pray to the court that Alhaji Abubakar Ibrahim be and ought to be declared as the candidate of the PDP based on the valid votes recorded at the primaries,”  he said.
