Cement Company of Northern Nigeria (CCNN) Plc has shown a continuous trend of aligning growth with returns to shareholders and other stakeholders. This has seen direct impact of the company’s operational performance becoming more pronounced and practical, a situation that ensures that the board and management of the Sokoto-based cement company continue to look at ways to optimise performance. In the last audit, CCNN increased total dividend payout for the 2018 business year by 235 per cent to N5.26bn after turnover and net profit jumped by 62 and 77 per cent respectively. The spiral increase in total dividend payout enabled the company to moderate the impact of significant dilution and increase in outstanding shares due to recent business combination on shareholders’ return. In 2018, the audited report and accounts for the year ended December 31, 2018, showed that CCNN’s turnover rose to N31.7bn in 2018 as against N19.58bn in 2017. The top-line growth was due largely to increased domestic sales and exports. CCNN produced 0.76 million metric tonnes of cement and sold over 0.74 million metric tonnes, an increase of about 59 per cent on 0.47 million metric tonnes sold in 2017. Sale of cement in Nigeria rose by 49 per cent to N28.9bn, while exports jumped from N0.2bn in 2017 to N2.9bn in 2018. Earnings before interest and taxes rose by 86 per cent to N7.9bn Profit Before Tax (PBT) increased by 81 per cent to N7.6bn. Profit After Tax (PAT) rose to N5.86bn in 2018 as against N2.91bn in 2017. In its latest results, CCNN showed stronger growth momentum ahead of analysts’ predictions. With three-digit growth in all key performance indices, CCNN recorded impressive growth in the first half of 2019. The half-year report for the period ended June 30, 2019, showed that total turnover rose by 166.14 per cent to N32.15bn in first half of 2019 as against N12.08bn in comparable period of 2018. Gross profit grew by 163.07 per cent from N5.47bn to N14.39bn. PBT jumped by 165.3 per cent from N3.66 billion to N9.71bn. After taxes, net profit leapt by 180 per cent from N2.60bn in first half of 2018 to N7.28bn in first half of 2019. Underlying performance ratios showed a generally stable outlook. Gross profit margin stood at 44.76 per cent. Pre-tax profit margin was steadied at 30.21 per cent, while net profit margin improved to 22.64 per cent. The balance sheet also showed a stronger and better-positioned company with reduced leverage and increased working capital. Total assets rose to N356.75bn in June, 2019, compared with N347.75bn recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018. Total equity increased from N333.49bn in December, 2018, to N340.77bn in June, 2019. Current assets rose from N17.28bn to N23.13bn, while non-current assets increased from N330.46bn to N333.6bn. The jump in growth in first half of 2019 came on the heels of December, 2018, business combination with Kalambaina Cement Company, a larger and newer Sokoto-based cement company. With CCNN’s pre-merger 500,000 metric tonnes per annum capacity and Kalambaina Cement Company’s 1.5 million metric tonnes per annum capacity, the emergent CCNN boasts of 2.0 million metric tonnes capacity, strengthening CCNN’s dominance as North West Nigeria’s largest cement company and giving the company the volume for aggressive expansion in Nigeria and beyond. Kalambaina Cement plant uses primary fuels such as coal, heavy oils and AGO and it is expected to help solve the power problem with limited downtime and further opportunities for growth and expansion. These competitive advantages are visible in the emerging results. CCNN and Kalambaina have related core investor, Damnaz Cement Company Limited, holding 50.7 per cent majority equity stake in CCNN. Abdul Samad Rabiu, who chairs the board of CCNN, holds the majority equity stake in Damnaz while his company, BUA International Limited, holds the 100 per cent stake in Kalambaina. The business combination not only made CCNN a stronger competition in the cement market, it pivoted its ranking at the Nigerian stock market, scaling up to become Nigeria’s 12th largest quoted company. Most analysts believe the business combination will further boost efficiency, productivity, output and better returns for CCNN. Rabiu said, “The opportunities within CCNN’s key markets and its export potentials are almost endless. Situated just about 100km from Niger Republic and as the nearest cement plant to key markets in Northern Nigeria, the enlarged CCNN is now poised to compete effectively and serve those markets better at a lower cost with more energy efficiency through our use of coal.” He noted that besides increase in total installed capacity of the company to 2.0 million metric tonnes per annum, the enlarged CCNN now boasts of new technology, reduced operational costs and an enlarged transport fleet, while the introduction of coal as the primary fuel for the kiln had considerably reduced the great dependency on the erratic LPFO. The chief executive of BUA Group said CCNN was taking advantage of its proximity to the neighbouring West African borders, which had opened a new window for the export operations and revenue generation in Foreign Exchange (Forex). The Managing Director of CCNN, Engr. Yusuf Binji, said the company would sustain its positive growth trajectory as it was now in a better and more competitive position to drive growth in its home market and exports. Engr. Binji said more benefits of the 2018 business combination and ongoing strategic initiatives would become more pronounced in the period ahead as the company continued to grow with economies of scale, enhanced operations and administrative efficiency. Most analysts are positive about CCNN’s outlook as the Chief Dealer of Globalview Capital Limited, Mr. Aruna Kebira, said the business combination with Kalambaina holds significant medium to long-term synergy that should deliver better results in the years ahead. Mr. Kebira said giving the immense additional capacity, proximity of locations and the strategic interest of major co-investors, the business combination holds a strong value proposition irrespective of short-term dilution of share, and that “in the long run, CCNN will be a sought-after stock.” In their review of the first half 2019 results, analysts at Cordros Securities concluded that CCNN was a high-return stock with potential total return of 124 per cent over the next 12 months. Investment One Financial Services Limited stated that the outlook for CCNN remained positive, citing the synergy from its recent business combination and market advantage. The analysts said the top-line growth in first half 2019 suggested the company might be recording success in its plan to expand market share to other places in Northern Nigeria, as the North West might not have the capacity to absorb new volumes. According to the analysts, while the third quarter might be a tepid quarter due to the rainy season, which slows construction, the company’s top-line performance might see support from potential increase in Federal Government’s capital expenditure spending following the appointment of the executive cabinet and implementation of the 2019 budget. While noting the decline in margin due to increased costs, Investment One said CCNN had potential to deliver improved sales and profitability.
