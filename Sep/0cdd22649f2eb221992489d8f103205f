The State House of Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal, sitting in Sokoto, on Monday dismissed the petitions filed against the elections of members representing Sabon Birni South II and Sokoto South II Constituencies in the State Assembly. The candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Sabon Birni South II constituency polls, Adamu Gado Gatawa filed the petition challenging the election of Sa’idu Neno Ibrahim of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Conversely, the APC Candidate for Sokoto South II Constituency election, Aminu Garba  Gidadawa filed the petition against the election of Mohammed Malami Ahmed of the PDP. In his petition, Gatawa claimed that Ibrahim was not qualified to contest the 9th of March, 2019 election, alleging that he did not acquire the necessary secondary education. He also alleged that the election recorded substantial non-compliance to the electoral laws of the country, and that Hon. Ibrahim was not duly elected as he has no high scored from the lawful votes cast. Delivering the judgement, Justice Hamman Idi Polycap, said the petition lacked merit. He explained that the petitioner failed to prove the allegations beyond reasonable doubts. Similarly, Justice I. Iwodi who delivered the judgement on Aminu Garba Gidadawa’s petition against the election of Mohammed Malami Ahmed dismissed it for lack of merit. Justice Iwodi said the petitioners could not prove the case beyond reasonable doubts.
