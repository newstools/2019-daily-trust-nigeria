The Director of Road Traffic Services (DRTS) in the FCT, Wadata Bodinga, has said they  will not spare any vehicle without due registration and painting. Bodinga, while speaking with newsmen, on the activities of the Service, also said its personnel impounded no fewer than 65 unworthy vehicles plying the Abuja roads. He said the DRTS officials with the support of police arrested the vehicles following their owners’ failure to obey the rules. “We will not accept vehicles without due registration to operate in Abuja, some are rickety ones and we cannot allow them to operate in the territory.” He said most of the vehicles were impounded at the Federal Secretariat, Ministry of Finance Junction, Area II and around office of the Head of Service. According to him, the operation was aimed at addressing reported cases of ‘one chance’ in and around the territory, and also a renewed fight against activities of other criminals that have been terrorising innocent residents of the territory. Bodinga, noted that the exercise was informed by the incessant complaints by residents. “The arrest of the unpainted vehicles will help in checkmating the activities of ‘one chance’ people in the territory,” he said.
