The Kimpact Development initiative (KDI) and the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES), USAID and UKAID have trained about 36 youths on monitoring the election tribunals in Nigeria. The project which has the support of the Court of Appeal, certified the monitors and introduced them to the various tribunals. The Executive Director for KDI, Mr. Bukola Idowu at the training said, “Monitoring election petition tribunals will go a long way in solving our electoral problems in Nigeria. Let’s contribute what we can. Our efforts will pay off eventually.” The training sessions were highly interactive as participants shared their views on Nigeria Judiciary (Tribunal) system. Speaking on behalf of the monitors, Ismail Bello, said, “Young people are insisting on effective democracy in Nigeria and for young Nigerians making little impact in pre and post-election processes in Nigeria. “We believe that the election petition tribunal monitoring findings, if implemented will go a long way to further strengthen our Judiciary and build on the achievement sof the President Muhammadu Buhari administration, he said. He added that there was the need to lay down a roadmap for a better electoral system in Nigeria and contributions to deepen democracy in Nigeria. 2019 Elections: Judiciary set, trains tribunal members PDP urges EU to sustain election monitoring in Nigeria How Court of Appeal set up 2019 election tribunals OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
