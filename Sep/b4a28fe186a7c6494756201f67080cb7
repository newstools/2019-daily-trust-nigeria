Members of the House of Representatives have called on the federal government to create a Special Security Fund for security agencies to tackle insurgency and other insecurity challenges. The House Chief Whip, Mohammed Tahir Monguno (APC Borno), who presented a motion on the matter during Plenary on Tuesday, said the country had in recent times being having challenges making security issue a major concern for the government. He said the ‎proposed Special Fund should be made a part of the national budget. Monguno, while commending the federal government’s efforts against insurgency, disclosed that the call was the result of interactions between the heads of security agencies and the House leadership earlier on Monday. The Chief Whip also appreciates the efforts of security agencies in curbing ‎insecurity and other challenges. He however noted that there is need for speedy action ‎to use all necessary measures to reduce the threats to the barest minimum. He also urged the House leadership to liaise with the Parliaments in the USA and other countries to overcome the bottlenecks associated with the procurement of hardware for the Nigerian Military. The Plenary was presided over by the Deputy Speaker, Ahmed Idris Wase, after the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila who earlier presided left for Uganda. While contributing on the matter, the Deputy Speaker said there seems to be an alleged deliberate sabotage by some ‎elements against federal government’s efforts to curb insurgency. The House therefore referred the matter to its joint security committee on security.
