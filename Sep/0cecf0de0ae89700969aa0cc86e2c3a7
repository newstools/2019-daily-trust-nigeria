The Minister of Science and Technology, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, has charged manufacturers in the country to produce quality products which can compete with their counterparts globally. The minister disclosed this in Lagos when he paid a working visit to the head office of Spectra Industries Limited, located in Agege, one of the government-approved incubation centres in the country. Daily Trust reports that the company produces beverages, sorghum and soya flour, among others. Dr. Onu, who inspected the production lines of the company, said Nigerian manufacturers were already using reversed technology in processing farm produce to finished products, which could be exported to boost the nation’s economy. “I took the decision to visit here personally. It is to see the success we have recorded in Nigeria. With what I have seen here, I am convinced that Nigeria is ready to hit the global market with quality and standard products. “I am using this occasion to call on other industrialists across the country to produce products that could compete not only in the sub-Saharan Africa but at a global level,” the minister said.
