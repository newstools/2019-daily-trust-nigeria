Former Governor of Abia State and the Senate Chief Whip, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu has denied media report that he has sold the issued share capital of his banking group- First International Bank (FIB) Group Limited in the Gambia. Senator Kalu in a statement by Obinna Kalu, Esq, Legal Adviser, FIB Group Ltd, said the report in an online medium was misleading. He disclosed that Slok Nigeria Limited had not sold any of its issued share capital in FIB Group Limited, The Gambia to any person or organisation. In a statement tagged, “Issued Share Capital of FIB Group Limited: Setting the Records Straight”, Kalu said, “Be it known that Slok Nig Ltd  remains the legal/genuine owners of FIB Group Ltd. and its subsidiary banks. “Recently, an illegal attempt by one Lilium Grays Ltd to take over  the subsidiary banks of FIB Group Limited was dismissed by the Supreme Court of The Gambia via a judgment delivered on 30th July,  2019, thus reaffirming that Slok Nigeria Ltd is the legal/genuine wholly owner of FIB Group Limited and its FiBank subsidiaries in Guinea, Gambia and Sierra Leone.” FCMB becomes Holding entity, names new MD Absence of prosecution stalls Orji Kalu''s trial over alleged N3.2bn fraud FCMB: Issues, benefits of becoming a holding company OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
