The police in Lagos on Wednesday arraigned a 19-year-old boy at the Ogba chief magistrate court for allegedly having unlawful carnal knowledge of a 15-year-old girl. The police told the court that the accused person, Adebowale Eshinlokun, who resides at Baale Street, Sangotedo, Lagos State, lured the girl into an apartment and had sexual intercourse with her. The girl’s parents were said to have received information about the incident and confronted their daughter. According to police prosecutor, Superintendent Benson Emerhi, the girl admitted the intercourse, telling the police that Eshinlokun lured her into the act. Her parents did not take the matter lightly and reported a case of rape against the accused person. Emerhi said when the police interrogated the accused person, he confessed to having a sexual affair with the girl, who he described as his girlfriend who he had been mutually having sex with. The court did not take Eshinlokun’s plea after the prosecutor asked the court to refer the matter to the Lagos State Department of Public Prosecution for advice. The magistrate, Mrs O. Sule-Amzat, ordered the defendant to be remanded in prison custody without an option of bail. Sule-Amzat adjourned the case till October 19, 2019 pending advice from the DPP.
