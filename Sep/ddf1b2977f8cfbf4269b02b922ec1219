Speaking Head of Project Management, Inteliworx Technologies, Ibrahim Tanko, said the meeting was to stimulate critical thinking, encourage lively discourse on matters of concern as well as proffer solutions to the numerous challenges facing the country. According to him, “The business challenge was informed by the cries of the masses, the experiences of people at train stations around the country and the need for government to look into the situation and to resolve the problems that the people are facing. “There are issues of ticket racketeering, overcrowding of the train coaches, problem of insecurity that is causing the mass influx of people at the train station among others. The event was organized with the view to investigate the reason why somethings are happening.” He disclosed that two teams, teams A and B, presented proposals, adding that it is hoped that the best team will proffer solution to the problem and present a ticketing system.
