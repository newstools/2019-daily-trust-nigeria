The House of Representatives has stepped down debate on the motion calling on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to deregister unpopular political parties. The motion sponsored by Francis Uduyok was seeking the electoral body to deregister parties that failed to win at least a seat in the National or State House of Assembly in the 2019 general elections. However, the Chief Whip, Mohammed Tahir Monguno, told the House that the Supreme Court had, in the case filed by the National Conscience Party, ruled that INEC lacks the constitutional power to deregister political parties. Deputy Speaker Ahmed Idris Wase who presided over the plenary ordered the motion to be stepped down. Meanwhile, the Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC) has decried the move by the House of Representatives to compel INEC) to deregister unpopular political parties. IPAC National Publicity Secretary Ademola Babatunde said the council under the leadership of Peter Ameh had directed that a response be issued to educate the lawmakers who made the statement that the purported decision was undemocratic and ran foul to any known constitutional democracy. He said therefore that such a move should stop, “because the matter is before the court of competent jurisdiction.” He said it was an elementary principle of Nigerian legislative process that once matters are before a competent court, no authority or persons legislate upon them, unless and until it is determined on its merit.
