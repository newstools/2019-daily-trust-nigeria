The problem of severe weather condition which impedes smooth flight operations at the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos and Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport (NAIA), Abuja might soon be a thing of the past. The Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) said, yesterday, that it has taken delivery of consignments of equipment for category 3 Instrument Landing Systems/Distance Measuring Equipment (ILS/DME) for Lagos and Abuja airports. The consignments, which were cleared over the weekend from Apapa wharf, are already at the premises of the agency in Lagos, NAMA said in a statement yesterday. Speaking on the development, the Managing Director of NAMA, Capt. Fola Akinkuotu, said installation of the landing aids which will commence soon, is part of the agencyâ€™s efforts to ensure that aircraft land in adverse weather conditions, especially during the harmattan. He also revealed that the second phase of the project involving the installation of ILS/DME in Kano, Port Harcourt and Katsina airports, will commence as soon as Lagos and Abuja installations are completed.
