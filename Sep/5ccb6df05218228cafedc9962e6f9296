Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) in Ogun State has expressed concern over what it called threats and arbitrary imposition of fines on companies in the state. The Chairman of MAN in the state, Saleem Adegunwa said this at the 34th Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the association in Abeokuta, yesterday. Adegunwa submitted that operating business in the state has been challenging due to “unfriendly policies of the immediate past administration.” Reviewing the performance of member companies in the 2018 manufacturing year, Adegunwa said a number of factories were sealed without following due process or obtaining requisite court orders. The Ogun MAN chairman called for a review of the payment of Water Abstraction/Borehole charges to the state Ministry of Environment which according to him ranges from N2m to N450m  annually. He also called for the discontinuation  of the proposed bill to make Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) mandatory for firms operating  in Ogun, adding that “CSR is by nature voluntary and an imposition of same  is unethical and goes against the riding principle of CSR”. He  also stressed an urgent need for a fire service in Agbara in Ado-Odo/Ota council area of the state “considering the large number of manufacturers and businesses in the area”. In his remarks, Governor, Dapo Abiodun reiterated his administration’s commitment to a viable Public- Private Partnership in its development plan. Abiodun, who was represented by his Deputy, Mrs Noimot Salako-Oyedele, recalled some of the measures his administration had put in place to boost business environment in the state.
