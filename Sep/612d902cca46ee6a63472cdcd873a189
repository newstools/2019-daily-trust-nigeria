Kano State Governor Abdullahi Ganduje says the almajiri system needs some reformation. According to him, the Islamic curriculum needs to be reformed because it goes beyond memorisation of Quran. Ganduje said this yesterday when he received an award of Best Governor in 100 Days in Office in Abuja from African Democracy Assessment Network , an association based in Dakar, Senegal. He said the huge population of citizens of Kano State would have been a liability without education. He said since all stakeholders had agreed to the decision to integrate both estern and almajiri systems of education, the programme would be successful. “Kano being most populous state, we’re vulnerable. Without education, our population will be a liability. Most of almajiris are not from Kano State. But we’ve to take care of them. The almajiri system is historical. 99% are Muslims. It needs some reformation.”  Without education, our population would have been a liability - Ganduje Kano State to integrate Almajiri system into modern education Kano’s candlelight OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
