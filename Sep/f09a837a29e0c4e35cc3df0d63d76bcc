The Nigerian Electricity Management Services Agency (NEMSA) will test and certify at least 5.5 million meters to be installed for customers of the Distribution Companies (DisCos) under the Meter Assets Providers (MAPs) regime between 2019 and 2022. According to statistics provided by the Managing Director of NEMSA, Engr. Peter Ewesor on Wednesday while addressing representatives of DisCos, the MAP firms and other stakeholders at a meeting. He said 10 of the DisCos presented their metering expectation for the MAP regime which began in May 2019. Only Kaduna Electric has yet to present its metering target. For the 10 DisCos, it is expected that 5.545 million meters are deployed within the four year period. The breakdown shows that 1.064 meters will be installed by the end of 2019; and 2.674m will be added in 2020. For the Year 2021, the MAP firms will install 1.593m meters while 313,637 meters will be installed in 2022. The records show that Ikeja DisCo will install the highest number of 1.074m meters between the 2019 and 2022 period. Ibadan DisCo is next with 988,557 meters, and Abuja DisCo is the third with an 867,251 metering target. The least of the meter target begins with Yola DisCo which has slated 400,000 meters. Kano DisCo has 475,000 meters and Jos has 500,000 target. For this year 2019, the breakdown indicates that 1,064,295 meters will be installed. Ibadan DisCo has set an ambitious 197,720 meter installation by December 2019; it is followed by Abuja DisCo with 170,000 units. Yola may install 169,000 while Ikeja will do 165,000 units; Jos plans 100,000 units, Enugu will install 85,000 meters while Benin will install 75,670 meters. The other targets for 2019 meter installation are: Kano DisCo (56,550), Eko (44,500), and Port Harocurt (38,824). Kaduna DisCo has yet to reveal it planned metering target under the ongoing MAP regime. Engr. Ewesor said the essence of the meeting was to meet with all critical stakeholders to ensure that there is better understanding of the different roles of the players in the MAP scheme. Abuja DisCo, said it has deployed 23,978 meters under MAP and raised concern that NEMSA may not cope with testing all meters as the volume rises. Responding, Ewesor said, NEMSA had prepared itself for the rising volume. “Apart from Oshodi, the other meter test stations have not even utilized up to 20 percent of their capacity.
From the record we have, I think we are capable of dealing with what we have.” He advised the MAP firms and DisCos to take their meter testing to NEMSA station in Kaduna and Port Harcourt instead of lumping them at the Oshodi test station. He also cautioned MAP against wrong meter installation that could shortchange the DisCo and the customer. “In some instance, a house will have a three phase meter and it is wired as single phase. That meter will not function well,” he said.
