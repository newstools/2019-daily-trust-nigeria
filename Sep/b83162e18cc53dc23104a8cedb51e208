The Oyo State governorship election petition tribunal sitting in Ibadan on Monday dismissed the petition of a governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adebayo Adelabu, for lacking merit. Adelabu, a former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), was challenging the declaration and return of Seyi Makinde as governor of the state in the March 9, 2019 governorship election in the state. The panel, chaired by Justice Sirajo Muhammed in unanimous judgment delivered on Monday, averred that the petitioners, Chief Bayo Adelabu and the All Progressives Congress failed to prove the allegation of corrupt practices, over voting, improper accreditation, inaccurate ballot counting and noncompliance with the 2010 Electoral Act as amended. Addressing reporters after the judgement, one of the counsels to Adelabu, Akin Olujimi, said he would team up with his colleagues, who are Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SAN), to study the full judgment to decide the next line of action after discussing with their client. “We will study the full judgment then we will know the next line of action. This judgment has just been delivered, and we need to look at everything which the court has decided and see whether to take it further.
