The Coalition of Northern Youth Organisations for National Integration has condemned the action allegedly taken by the Rivers governor Nyesom Wike to demolish a mosque at the Trans-Amadi area of Port Harcourt, the state capital. The group described the said decision as a plan meant to score a cheap political feat in order to distract the good people of Rivers state from holding him accountable and to cause more divisions among other Nigerians of all faiths. In a statement signed by the group’s coordinator, Bashir Katsina, and issued in Abuja on Monday, the Coalition of Northern Youth Organisation urged eminent Nigerians from all walks of life to call the governor to order through their influence and various peace platforms initiatives that they chair, the statement added.

The group commended Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano state for what it described as his timely intervention in litigation. PDP Convention: Group rejects Port Harcourt 2017: What a year!
