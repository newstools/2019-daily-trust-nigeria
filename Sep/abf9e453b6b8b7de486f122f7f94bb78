The governorship and National Assembly election petition tribunal sitting in Minna, yesterday, upheld the election of Governor Abubakar Sani Bello of Niger State. The PDP’s candidate in the last governorship election in the state, Alhaji Umar Nasko and his party had dragged the APC candidate, Bello and his deputy, Ahmed Ketso, before the tribunal. The petitioners alleged that the duo presented forged academic and declaration of age certificates to INEC, while also alleging irregularities during the said election. Delivering judgment on the matter, the chairman of the tribunal, John Igboji, held that the petitioners failed woefully to support their allegations with the required evidence. “We have come to the inevitable conclusion that the petitioners have failed to establish their case as there is no shred of cogent evidence in proof of the allegation as required by relevant laws. “In the circumstance, we accordingly hold that the petitioners are not entitled to any relief sought. The petition is hereby dismissed for lack of merit. “We therefore affirm and uphold the election of the first respondent, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, as the duly elected governor of Niger State,” he ruled. The tribunal also awarded a cost of N50,000 each against the petitioners in favour of the respondents.
