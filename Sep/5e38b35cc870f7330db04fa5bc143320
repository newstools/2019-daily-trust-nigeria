An organization committed to youth employment, Street Project Foundation (SPF), has commenced preparations for the third edition of its Creative Youth Boot Camp, with the theme, ‘Art for Social Transformation’. The Foundation said the programme, which holds between November 11, 2019 and December 21, 2019, aims to develop the spirit of enterprise, using cross-cultural dialogue through creative arts, to alleviate youth unemployment in the country. Towards the success of the initiative, the organization is seeking collaboration with Abuja-based employer-partners in the creative arts and corporate bodies to build the capacity of creatively-inclined people between the ages of 16 and 25. In a media briefing in Lagos yesterday, SPF’s Founder and Lead Visionary, Rita Ezenwa-Okoro, explained that the organisation’s youth development programme explores how play and performance positively impact learning and mental growth among young people. Registration for the programme is currently in progress and will close on October 7, 2019.  45 Nigerian civic organizations, individuals get $453,568 US grant ‘Youth cooperatives will reduce unemployment’ Kwara youths mentored on entrepreneurship OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
