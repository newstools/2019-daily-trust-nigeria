The National Executive Committee (NEC) of the National Conscience Party (NCP) has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to sack all the serving service chiefs and replace them with others who have fresh ideas on how to end the Boko Haram insurgency in the North East. The NEC also accused the security agents in the country of conniving with criminals to carry out “their nefarious activities,” adding that Nigerians were losing hope in the government. Addressing newsmen on Monday in Abuja, at the end of the party’s NEC meeting which lasted for several hours, the NCP National Chairman and former presidential candidate of the party, Dr. Yunusa Tanko, said the security chiefs lacked new ideas to end the security challenges bedeviling the nation.

Tanko said the NEC also asked President Buhari to declare a state of emergency on the economy and the agriculture sectors. Dr. Tanko explained that Nigerians were waxing in abject poverty and hunger while the government was busy allegedly handling opposition elements in the country.
