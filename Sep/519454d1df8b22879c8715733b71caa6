The Satellite Towns Development Department (STDD) in the FCT Administration has commenced the installation of solar street lights in some satellite towns of the FCT. A statement from STDD PRO, Meeme Felicia, said  the Director of the Department, Felix Nwanko, said the solar street lights installation is in LOT 1 and LOT 2, adding that the contract has been awarded to two different contractors. According to him, Karshi  town is awarded to M/S Basman Project Ltd for area coverage of 8km while the Kubwa town solar street lights installation was awarded to M/S  Sunlite Integrated Services Ltd for area coverage of 5.8km. The director on inspection of the street lights installation recently at Karshi, said the installation was 85 percent completed while the Kubwa solar street light installation is at the stage of surveying, adding that the contract of the solar streets lights installation was part of the 2017 procurements. He explained that the solar street lights were meant for the locations in the satellite towns that do not have street lights, saying Kubwa would be installed in the road 1 collector, while the Karishi will be covering so many short roads. Additional locations and towns, he said, would be considered as funds were made available through provision in this year’s budget.
