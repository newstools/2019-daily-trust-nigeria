Senator Nimi Barigha-Amange who represented Bayelsa East Senatorial District between 2007 and 2011, has left the PDP for the APC. Barigha-Amange, who is a founding member of the PDP, yesterday, submitted a letter acknowledged by the APC chairman in Ward II, Nembe Local Government Area (LGA), Nembe at the partyâ€™s National Secretariat in Abuja through the Acting National Secretary, Victor Giadom. He attributed the decision for leaving the PDP to what he described as authoritarian attitude of Governor Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa whom he accused of solely nominating 105 councillors and eight chairmen in the oil rich state.
