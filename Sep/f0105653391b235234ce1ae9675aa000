Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of the Governing Board of the Federal University of Petroleum Resources, Effurun, Delta State, Prof Abdullahi Shehu Zuru, has announced plans to establish modular refineries and biomass production in the country. Professor Shehu Zuru, who made this known at a media briefing recently, said the institution is playing a lead role in redefining the country’s alternative energy mix by setting up the company ‘Energy Solutions’ in the school. “We have secured strategic partnership with similar institutions like the University of Brunel in the UK in organizing the national workshop on biomass as an alternative energy mix for the country and it is also another milestone and we have won awards,” he said. “The university is developing a modular refinery. We would like to key into the Federal Government resolve to licence modular refineries to augment our aggregate petroleum production and local refining capacity.”  Modular refineries: FG secures N179.9bn loan from China, eyes 100,000 jobs Electricity: Don advocates investment in biomass refineries Oil production cut may not affect Nigeria at OPEC meeting OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
