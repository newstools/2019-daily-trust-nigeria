The Imo State Congress of America (ISCA) has asked Governor Emeka Ihedioha of Imo State to see his victory at the tribunal as a reaffirmation of the confidence the people of the state reposed in him. In a congratulatory message to the governor, signed by its president, Engr. Sam Udeh, the group also asked the governor to redouble effort in serving the people. It called on other contestants to accept the ruling of the tribunal, saying that the state had suffered setbacks and therefore the need to avoid any act that could distract the governor. “It is our belief that with the verdict of the tribunal, we should give peace a chance. This is to allow Governor Ihedioha focus on the daunting task of rebuilding and recovering the state from its present state of underdevelopment and wanton setback in all facets. “We also urge other contestants to accept the tribunal verdict in good faith since the primary goal of contesting election is to bring about development in the state. Again, we urge our people to shun vendetta so as to expunge distractions to the present government, for which the people are usually at the receiving end,” the group said. It also called on the people of the state to rally round the governor and give him the necessary support to succeed.
