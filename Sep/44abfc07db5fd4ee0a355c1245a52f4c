The All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) has said that a former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, remains a member of the party despite his appointment as a member of the newly-constituted Presidential Economic Advisory Council. The national chairman of APGA, Dr. Victor Ike Oye, said this yesterday in Abuja while congratulating Prof. Soludo on the appointment. Soludo is a member of the Board of Trustees (BoT) of APGA and is also among the party’s leaders in Anambra State. Oye said the appointment is well-deserved, timely and auspicious. “Detractors who might want to politicize the appointment of Soludo who is a strong member of APGA should be warned. The party threw its weight behind the appointment,” he said.
