The Governorship Election Tribunal sitting in Kaduna State has declared the State Governor, Nasir el-Rufai, as winner of the March 9 governorship election in the state. ‎The tribunal judge, Justice Ibrahim Bako, struck out the petition filed by the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Isa Ashiru, over lack of evidence. Ashiru had filed a petition challenging the victory of Governor El-Rufai who is of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Addressing newsmen shortly after the judgment, counsel to El-Rufai, Abdulhakeem Mustapha (SAN), said the petitioners failed woefully to show that the election was not conducted in compliance with the Electoral Act. Chairman of PDP in the state, Felix Hassan Hyet, said the party would make its position known officially after meeting with their team of lawyers and the party’s governorship candidate. He also said for the tribunal to agree that elections were conducted in all local government areas of the state including Birnin Gwari and Giwa that were not accessible during the election due to insecurity was unfortunate. He appealed to the party supporters to remain calm and law abiding and wait for the party position soon. In his reaction, El-Rufai described the outcome of the tribunal as a welcome development and called on all residents of the state to join hands with his administration to turn around the state. The governor was quoted in a statement by his spokesman, Muyiwa Adekeye, as thanking the tribunal for its verdict and expressing his gratitude to the people of the state.
