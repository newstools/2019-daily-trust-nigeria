The Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT),  Mallam Muhammad Musa Bello, has charged the Special Ministerial Task team on the free flow of traffic on the AYA-Nyanya axis of the Abuja-Keffi road  to ensure that the exercise is sustained. The chairman of the team, Ikharo Attah, disclosed this while speaking with newsmen at the weekend. According to Attah, “the minister stated that residents living in the area and those commuting on the road should not be allowed to go through what they experienced before the team was set up.” OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY “The minister tasked us to be dynamic and innovative in studying the situation to always ensure that the exercise is not only improved upon but sustained,” he said.

He assured that his team was working to make vehicular and human movement in the area better. “One thing I can assure residents of the FCT is the unwavering commitment of the FCT minister towards addressing traffic challenges in all areas of the territory particularly during peak periods,” he added.
