Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni has been asked to nominate his successor as the national secretary of the APC to lay to rest the agitation created by the vacancy. Months after Buni left the position to contest in the state governorship election in May this year, the position has been vacant, thus heightening agitation. The forum of state chairmen of APC on Tuesday, gave the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party a 10-day ultimatum to fill the vacant position. A stalwart of the party, Ibrahim Jirgi in a letter to the governor, said: “As a concerned member for the progress of the APC and in particular, the strategic role of the North East in bringing about the electoral successes of the party, I write to call your attention to the urgency of acting quickly to get the position of the national secretary of party filled by a competent member from the Zone. “I recall that the National Working Committee of the APC has since June 2019 said it has asked Your Excellency and the leaders of the party in the North East to fill the vacancy. “By the party’s subsisting arrangement, since the deputy national auditor is from Borno, the national secretary would have to come from Yobe which places the responsibility of nominating a replacement squarely on Your Excellency.” 100 days after Buni’s exit, battle for APC scribe persists Hot race for APC National Secretary as Buni becomes Yobe governor - elect Aspirant wants APC to appoint substantive national secretary OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
