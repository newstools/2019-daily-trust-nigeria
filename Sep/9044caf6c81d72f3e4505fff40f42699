As part of its corporate social responsibility, the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) has donated patrol vehicles to the FCT police command, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) and the Nigerian Correctional Service. The Executive Secretary of the agency, Abdulkadir Saidu, who presented a Peugeot 406 vehicle to the FCT Commissioner of Police, Bala Ciroma, said the gesture was to give logistics support to the command for the effective policing of the territory. He appreciated the efforts of the command in combating crime in the nation’s capital and its environs. Saidu noted that the police have lived up to their responsibility as a foremost security organisation in Nigeria and at the international level. The PPPRA executive secretary, who was represented by the Acting General Manager, Corporate Services, Mr Kimchi Apollo, said time has come for all well-meaning Nigerians, corporate bodies from both public and private sectors to support security organisations in the country for effective and efficient discharge of their roles to enhance a conducive environment. He said PPPRA was impressed by the NSCDC in tackling pipeline vandalism. The NSCDC Commandant General, Abdullahi Mohammed, who also received the vehicle, expressed appreciation to the PPPRA for its response to the clarion call for support. He noted that the gesture had made the NSCDC to know that Nigerians are feeling its impact and that will motivate them to do more. The Deputy Comptroller of Nigeria Correctional Service, Mr Emmanuel Bamidele, who received the vehicle, lauded the agency for the gesture, saying “it is rare from a government agency to remember that an organisation is in dire need of modern working tools to aid its operations.”  page 45 FCT election: Police order restriction of movement FCT election: Police orders restrction of movement OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
