The Forum of All Progressives Congress (APC) state chairmen has given a 10-day ultimatum to the Comrade Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee (NWC) to address their concerns. The forum’s chairman, Ali Bukar Bolari, told Daily Trust that the ultimatum started from September 23 this year. He said members of the NWC are expected to address their concerns, including the neglect of members of the party after the 2019 general elections. “ We want the NWC to take care of our members who laboured to ensure the victory of our party in last general elections through appointments,” he said in a phone interview. The forum had in a communiqué issued and signed by Bolari and the forum’s secretary, Ben Nwoye, on Tuesday, said they were protesting against poor reward system in the party, abandonment of founding fathers, neglect of the entire party structure, and the failure to produce a substantive National Secretary after the exit of Mai Mala Buni. They expressed concern over the lukewarm attitude of party leadership to the plight of either dead or kidnapped colleagues in various states. They complained against their neglect in respect of federal appointments and absence of national secretary who, among others, should be liaising with the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) in the constitution of boards of federal agencies and parastatals. The state chairmen said the open letter option was considered after previous entreaties to the Progressive Governors’ Forum and the leadership of the National Assembly yielded no positive results.
