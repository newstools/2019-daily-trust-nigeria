The governorship candidate of Allied Peoples Movement (APM), Yusuf Mamman Dantalle, has claimed that the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) are working to stifle opposition in the November 16 governorship election in Kogi State. Addressing a press conference, yesterday in Abuja, Dantalle who is the APM national chairman, alleged that there was a grand plan to rig the election in favour of Governor Yahaya Bello, the APC candidate. He said part of the plot was to silence candidates who were seen to pose a threat to the APC candidate by ensuring they withdrew from the race. He alleged that many candidates of opposition parties were being contacted to step down for Bello, including him (Dantalle).
