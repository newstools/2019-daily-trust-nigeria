Members of the House of Representatives led by Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila yesterday paid a condolence visit to Katsina State over incessant banditry and kidnapping in the state, pledging to assist the state overcome the challenges. Gbajabiamila told the governor, Aminu Masari, that they were in the state to find out the true position of things and to ascertain what kind of assistance is needed from the national level. “States cannot deal with issues like this on their own,” he said. “Issues like this are complicated and complex and we believe that [government at the] federal level, which has the security apparatus, must have something we can do to assist the state,” he said. “We have been to Zamfara, Borno and now Katsina. The story seems to be the same but with little difference here and there. Kidnapping is a major problem. We are here to see and compliment what you are doing to find a lasting solution to this problem,” he said. In his remarks, Governor Masari appreciated the concern shown by the House, which he said he holds in high esteem. He said the administration is presently trying to normalise the situation through interventions it plans to follow through saying that the national assembly should expect demands from the state as the 2020 budget is coming up so that issues of infrastructure as demanded by the people can be tackled. During the working visit, the Speaker also visited some Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) taking refuge at GidanBaki in the metropolis because of attacks on their communities. He also took time to teach at Governement Day secondary school KofarSauri, where he praised teachers for their selfless service to humanity.
