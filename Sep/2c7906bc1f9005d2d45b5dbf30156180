Anambra State Governor Willie Obiano has warned the Peoples Democratic Party in the state to stop its politics of bitterness and antagonism. Speaking through the Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Mr. C. Don Adinuba, the governor said the 2021 governorship race in the state and the 2023 general elections are still far away. “It is absolutely immoral and unfair to the people of Anambra State to start a campaign of demonization and annihilation now. Even if the elections were already around the corner, it will still be absolutely wrong to attempt to bring back the PDP style of politics, the politics of violence, kidnapping, mayhem and arson. Our state has since left Egypt, and nothing can make Ndi Anambra return to the years of the locusts,” he said. Reacting, Publicity secretary of PDP in Anambra state Mr.Nnamdi Nwangwu said the allegations do not merit reaction. “APGA government is just being afraid because of the feat the PDP achieved during last election. It is the right of the people to query the government. PDP won in all the local government and they are afraid, “he said.
