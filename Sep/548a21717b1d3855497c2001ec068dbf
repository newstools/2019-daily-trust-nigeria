The All Progressives Congress (APC) Aspirants Forum has said that the ruling party will continue to rule the country even after President Muhammadu Buhari has completed his tenure in 2023. The newly elected national coordinator of the forum Col. Abdul’Aziz Musa Yar’Adua (rtd) accompanied by other executive members, told reporters on Monday in Abuja that the APC government of President Buhari is fulfilling the party’s campaign promises. According to him, the forum has membership of over 9000 aspirants who lost nominations for various offices during the party primaries last year across the country. Yar’Adua, who is former governorship aspirant in Katsina State, said those who were aggrieved over alleged irregularities that characterized APC primaries have all resolved to work for the success of the party at all levels and support elected representatives to fulfil their campaign promises. 2015: Buhari’s camp insists on automatic Presidential ticket 2019:  Screening Panel to decide Atiku, Saraki, Tambuwal, others’ fate What’s there  for Atiku in PDP?
