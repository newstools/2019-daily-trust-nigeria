The APC in Ondo State has said that the verdict of the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal (PEPT) is an affirmation of the level of independence of the judiciary and its commitment to a true justice system. With this ruling, the party said it was clear that the election was conducted in an orderly manner, also, within the requirements of the legal framework of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. In a statement signed by the director of media and publicity of the party in the state, Mr Steve Otaloro, the party said the verdict will afford President Buhari the chance to concentrate on providing purposeful leadership for the transformation of the country. Similarly, an Anambra chieftain of the party,  Johnbosco Onunkwo, has described the tribunal’s judgment as victory for Nigerians. Onunkwo, in a statement signed by his media adviser, Mr. Dominic Barcity, said the victory will motivate the president to do more. Hailing the development, Chief Onunkwo said: “The judgment of the tribunal has again put a judicial seal on the mandate freely given to the president by Nigerians in the February 23 presidential election. “The judgment is a clear pointer to the fact that all processes and procedures for genuine election were followed during the election being challenged by the opposition party and its presidential candidate.”  ...Omoworare’s election too Group commends G-23 convener for Buhari S/East victory Atiku heads to S/Court as  Buhari wins at tribunal OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
