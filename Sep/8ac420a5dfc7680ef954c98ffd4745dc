Mrs. Osinbajo gave the advise at a town hall meeting with Benue youth at the Government House in Makurdi. The Vice President’s wife further stressed the need for young people to shun drugs or other substances which propelled its victims to rape, steal and engage in violence. Mrs. Osinbanjo also emphasised on adequate and intensive prayers for the upliftment and well-being of the girl-child in Nigeria while she spoke at the 49th edition of Benue Women In Prayers (BEWIP) organised by wife of Benue State governor, Dr. Eunice Ortom, at Chapel of Grace Government House Makurdi.
