The Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) has advised the Federal Government to replace direct cash intervention funding for small businesses with finance leasing to de-risk the loans by 80 per cent. The President of ACCI, Prince Adetokunbo Kayode, said this at the official opening ceremony of the 2019 Abuja International Trade Fair (AITF) in Abuja yesterday. Prince Kayode said finance leasing, which provides for direct procurement of Capital Equipment (CAPEX) by funding agency to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and the provision of only Operational Expenses (OPEX) as against the prevailing direct cash would prevent diversion into several other concerns. He said, “Since CAPEX is usually about 80 per cent of total capital requirement, this leads to a de-risking of the facility up to about 80 per cent, especially with the covering of cost for delivery, installation, maintenance and insurance.” He said the current system of funding mechanism for the SMEs was defective and that this defect must be resolved expeditiously.
