The Presidential Election Petitions Tribunal has dismissed the claim by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate, Atiku Abubakar that President Muhammadu Buhari was not qualified to contest the February 23 election. In its leading judgment, the five-member panel of justices presided by Justice Mohammed Garba held that PDP and Atiku failed to prove non-qualification and false information against Buhari over his school certificate. The tribunal said the allegation and the argument that he did not attach the qualification listed in his INEC Form CF001 was not the requirement in sections 131, 137 and 138(1) and (b) of the Nigerian Constitution as well as the requirement of Section 176 of the Constitution. Justice Garba held that: “In my view, the second respondent (Buhari) posses impressive credentials to contest the office of the president. “The second respondent is not only qualified, but eminently qualified to contest for the office of the president.” Atiku: Buhari did not present his qualification to contest Tribunal dismisses Buhari, APC's motions on non-qualification, Atiku's citizenship Buhari, Atiku know fate  as tribunal rules today OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
