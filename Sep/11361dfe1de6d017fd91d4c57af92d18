Meanwhile, the Nigerian delegation has left for the United Kingdom to discuss with its legal team on strategies to deal with the $9.6bn UK judgment against Nigeria A statement yesterday from the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, disclosed this. The Federal High Court in Abuja had Thursday ordered the winding up of P&ID and its Nigerian affiliate, P&ID Nigeria Limited, for charges of fraud and tax evasion in respect of the contract leading to the recent controversial judgment of a British court empowering the firm to seize about $9.6bn worth of Nigerian assets. The federal government is seeking the leave of the court to set aside the $9.6b damages; a stay of execution of the award and approaching an appellate court if its application is refused. Malami was quoted as saying that “All cards are on table.” The minister said no possibility was ruled out. He said: “The possibility of filing a new case and or using existing proceedings to seek relief of setting aside the award (of the contract) cannot be ruled out”. $9.6bn judgment: FG, P&ID head for showdown BREAKING: $9.6 billion award - P&ID plead guilty to tax evasion, fraud BREAKING: $9.6 billion award- Court orders forfeiture of P&ID assets in Nigeria OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
