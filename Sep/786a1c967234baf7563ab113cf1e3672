The Plateau State House of Assembly has suspended the screening of commissioner nominees over unpaid allowances, our correspondent gathered. Our correspondent reports that, 19 out of the 23 nominees were screened before the suspension. The lawmakers commenced the screening last week. A source at the assembly said the suspension was not unconnected to the unpaid two months allowances of the lawmakers. It was also gathered that the members were using the screening as a tool to negotiate the payment of the allowances. Contacted, the House Committee Chairman on Information Philip Dasun, said the suspension of the screening was due to other exigencies. He said the screening would be concluded when next they sit. Our correspondent reports that he did not give a specific date when the house will reconvene. It would be recalled that Governor Simon Lalong had last week forwarded the commissioner nominees list to the House of Assembly for screening and confirmation.
