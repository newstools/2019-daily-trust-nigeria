The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has asked the Presidency to apologise to Nigerians over what it called, President Muhammadu Buhari’s poor outing at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). The PDP in a statement yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said Buhari’s “off-the-point speech” on climate change, as response to direct and simple question on his plan for the youth, confirmed his personal inability to understand and effectively communicate in English language as required by Section 318 (iii) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended). “Instead of insulting Nigerians, the Presidency should apologize to our citizens over the embarrassments constantly brought to our nation by President Buhari,” the party said. “The PDP notes that President Buhari’s failure to comprehend the question put to him and respond accordingly trashes his claims of attending education to school certificate level and possessing a WAEC certificate, and further brings to light the reasons for his inability to attach any educational certificate as required in INEC form CF001. “The party states that it was obvious to all that because of President Buhari’s inability to understand and communicate in English language (as required by the constitution), he failed to distinguish the fact that the text already prepared for him by his handlers had no correlation with question put to him at the UN,”the party said. But the media office of the Presidency said President Buhari chose to deliver prepared remarks“ His prepared remarks were wholly in alignment with the theme of the Panel event, and the question he was asked,” it stated.
