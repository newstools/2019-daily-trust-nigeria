A member of the National Assembly representing Maru/Bungudu Federal Constituency, Shehu Ahmed, has distributed tricycles and cash worth over N10m to 134 women as part of his plan to empower 5000 women in his constituency. Presenting the tricycles (Keke Napep) and cash gifts to the beneficiaries, the lawmaker said the gesture to empower the 5000 women in his constituency was to make them self-reliant and be able to contribute to the development of the state and the nation. “This is in line with the manifesto of our great party, the PDP. During my campaigns l promised to carry women along so this is some of my blueprints to empower women,” he said. Ahmed added that he decided to empower the women based on the premise that if a woman is empowered, a whole family is empowered. “I will soon start free-interest loans and security awareness campaigns projects, to ensure that the dividends of democracy reach our people at grassroots”, he said. Ahmed presented 10 women with tricycle each, while 10 other women got N300,000 each to improve their farms  and the remaining 94 women got N20,000 cash each to start their own businesses.. Earlier, Comrade Musa Umar Aboki, the Director of Programmes, Fulbe Care Initiative (FCI), the NGO coordinating the distribution of the lawmaker’s empowerment  programme, said beneficiaries were selected through transparent process. “All beneficiaries are residents of the two local government areas that made up the constituency and they all have INEC Permanent Voters Card (PVC)”, he said.
