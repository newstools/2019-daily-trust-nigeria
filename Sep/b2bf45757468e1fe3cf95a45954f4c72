A former Minister of State for Agriculture and Rural Development, and one of the aspirants in the just-concluded APC governorship primary poll in Bayelsa State, Senator Heineken Lokpobiri, has rejected the outcome of the exercise. The reaction of Lokpobiri, who described the primary election as a charade, came moments after the party’s electoral panel declared Chief David Lyon as the winner. Lokpobiri said the only authentic person in position to conduct and declare result of the governorship primary election was the Governor of Yobe State, Mai-Mala Buni, as was appointed by the national leadership of the party. He said, “I have never seen where a governorship primary starts in an hotel and ended in an hotel.” The Minister of State for Petroleum and former governor of the state, Chief Timipre Sylva, had told newsmen after voting in Okpoama ward 4, Brass LGA, that there was no time better than now for APC to take over Bayelsa State. Sylva, who is the leader of APC in the state, said the primary election was peaceful and orderly.
