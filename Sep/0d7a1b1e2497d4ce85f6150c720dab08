The Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Professor Akin Abayomi, has said no child in Lagos should die from malaria or dysentery. Abayomi made the declaration on Tuesday while responding to a speech by a delegation of a non-governmental organisation in the Partnership for Advocacy in Child and Family Health at Scale (PACFaH@Scale) project in Lagos State. The PACFaH@Scale is a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s funded project active in eight states of the federation. The Commissioner said, “It is zero tolerance of death for any mother or child. We will not build Rome in one day, but let us accept in our minds that the indices for maternal and child mortality are not acceptable.” He said the health ministry would work towards harmonising primary health care approach by standardising allocation of resources, infrastructure and administration.
