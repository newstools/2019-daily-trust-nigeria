Ogun State Governor Prince Dapo Abiodun, yesterday, said he went through the most turbulent electoral process than any governor following his victory at the tribunal on Saturday. Speaking with journalists in Abeokuta, Abiodun said apart from the tribunal, he went through about nine pre-election cases before his emergence at the poll. Our correspondent recalled that the governorship election petition tribunal, at the weekend, dismissed the petition filed against Abiodun’s victory in the March 9 election by Allied Peoples Movement (APC) candidate, Adekunle Akinlade. The tribunal held that the petition failed irredeemably over the petitioner’s inability to prove the case. In his reaction, Abiodun said, “My first reaction is to give glory to Almighty God. And to say that this is further affirmation that indeed with God nothing shall be impossible. This victory is for Ogun State people who have entrusted me with this mandate. It has been contested in so many courts. “I have gone through probably one of the most turbulent periods any governor could have gone through. I went through several pre-election cases – about eight or nine – and also this tribunal. “God has continued to remain God. This mandate is a divine mandate and I believe that is obvious to all. This is a decision of the people of Ogun State and that was further ratified by the people,” he said.
