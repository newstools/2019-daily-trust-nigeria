The Practice Manager Africa, World Bank, Mrs Iffath Sharif, says she is pleased with the implementation of the Community Social Development Project (CSDP) in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Sharif, who spoke when she inspected the construction of culvert at Godoji community in Kuje Area Council, said “I am super pleased to see the partnership between CSDP and the community. I came here expecting to see the project that CSDP supported but I think what I saw was more than that. I saw a partnership between our project and the community and the local leadership which is really encouraging. “It has shown that with one small investment in terms of this culvert, you can affect the lives of many communities, not just for commerce and trade but also access to healthcare and education.” She said the Nigerian government will have to decide if the programme should continue. “I look forward to working with our clients, the government and ministry to decide what the Nigerian government would like to do. We look forward to having that dialogue with them. The chairman of the community project management committee, Yusuf Gado, said the culvert linked more than 20 communities, adding that before now, they were usually cut off especially during the rainy season. “Some years ago, we were suffering on how to get across this river during the rainy season. The river would overflow and the people will not be able to cross. We developed interest in the culvert as our number one project when we heard about CSDP,” he said. He said the community contributed N910,853 which was 10 per cent of the cost of the project while the FCT CSDP gave a grant of N8, 197, 677.90.
