A chieftain of the APC in Bayelsa State, Mr Livingston Egbe, has suggested that with the difficult terrain, only indirect primary can ensure transparent election to produce the party’s candidate for the November 16, 2019 governorship election. Egbe, who is the director of Planning, Research and Strategy in Senator Heineken Lokpobiri’s campaign organization, made the suggestion, yesterday, while speaking with journalists in Yenagoa. He said though the campaign team was not afraid of any mode of primary because his candidate was prepared to deliver the dividends of democracy to the people of the state, indirect primary would be ideal during the rainy season because of the difficult terrain.

So, to avoid all those acrimonies and arguments, let us adopt an acceptable mode of primary and that is indirect primary for the sake of transparency and accountability,” he said.
