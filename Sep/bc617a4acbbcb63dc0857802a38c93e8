President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday expressed “deep sorrow” over the killing of a kidnapped aid worker of an international NGO, Action Against Hunger, as revealed in a video by Islamic State in West Africa Province. Buhari, in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, condemned what he called “the gruesome murder” of aid workers, who had made sacrifices and risked their lives to provide succour for traumatized people. Buhari, who implored humanitarian organisations not to be discouraged by the “cowardly acts” of terrorists, said the humanitarian spirit of aid workers had impacted “greatly” on the operations in the northeast. Buhari assured all humanitarian workers, especially those in the northeast, and citizens held in captivity as his administration would “intensely pursue and ensure their freedom by using every possible means at the disposal of government”. He said his government would work with neighbouring states to free all hostages. “We’ll practically and completely erase terrorism from this country and the entire sub-region,” he said.
