The International Monetary Fund, IMF has announced that World Bank CEO and Bulgarian environmental economist, Kristalina Georgieva, will become the Fund’s new Managing Director. Georgieva replaces Christine Lagarde who resigned on September 12th. “Under Georgieva’s leadership, we will see emphasis on gender inequality, environmental issues and the need for more resources to be directed to the developing world,” stated Eric LeCompte, who monitors the IMF and is the Executive Director of the religious development group Jubilee USA Network. “She is the first IMF chief who comes from an emerging market country.” Georgieva is the second woman to head the Fund in its 75-year history. The new Managing Director begins her tenure amidst turbulent economic forecasts. “She takes the helm at the IMF among warnings of global financial crisis, escalating trade tensions and declines in economic growth,” noted LeCompte.
