The Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Adetunji, on Saturday elevated a former Head of Service in Oyo State, Chief Kudrat Iyabo Adeleke, from her chieftaincy status to Maye Iyalode of Ibadanland. The monarch also elevated Chief Precilia Kuye as Abese Iyalode, Chief Mojisola Oyebola as Agbaakin, and Chief Mojisola Ladipo as Ikolaba Iyalode of Ibadanland. The Oluwo Afobaje of Ibadanland, Chief Ismaila Idowu Popoola, who performed the right on behalf of the Olubadan, told the four women that Oba Adetunji and his High Chiefs, including the Iyalode of Ibadanland, had approved their elevation for the progress of Ibadanland and to pave way for those on the lower rungs of the Ibadan chieftaincy ladder to move up. Adeleke, a former caretaker chairman of Ibadan North Local Government and Permanent Secretary, Oyo State Civil Service Commission, described her elevation as long overdue.
