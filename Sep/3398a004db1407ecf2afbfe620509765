A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State, Charles Idahosa, has said that the state governor, Godwin Obaseki, can’t be forced out of APC by the national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole. Idahosa, who stated this while speaking on the political crisis in the state, said Obaseki can win without Oshiomhole. He warned that any attempt to push Obaseki out of APC or deny him the governorship ticket will be resisted, adding that if allowed, it may be the end of APC in the state. “Nobody can push Obaseki out of APC unless they want to kill the party in our state. Edo is the only APC state in South-South and South East. If he is forced out of APC, then that will be the end of the party in Edo,” he said. He attributed the crisis between Oshiomhole and Obaseki to envy and jealousy, noting that crisis of jealousy and envy was difficult to settle. “It is a case of jealousy and envy. Obaseki has performed well in the last two years and if given the opportunity for another term, he will do more than what he is doing now. “The only thing Oshiomhole likes is what comes from him. If you come up with any idea that is not from him even if it is a good idea, it is not right; he wants to be seen as initiator of the project,” he said.
