The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has said that President Muhammadu Buhari is restoring Nigeria to respectable international standing with his “inspiring address” at the United Nations 74th General Assembly in New York. The APC National Publicity Secretary, Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, in a statement, hailed the president’s call for strong action against xenophobia, racism, poverty, climate change, international crimes, terrorism and other forms of threat to life. The party assured that under the President Buhari administration, Nigeria will remain a reliable and frontline global partner in the promotion of international peace, security and sustainable development. “The work to rebuild the country is not fully accomplished, but we can look back with pride at the strides and successes we have accomplished. With the support of Nigerians and indeed our global partners we will achieve the Nigeria of our dream. “From our previously battered international image, it is a thing of immense pride that Nigeria, under the President Buhari-led APC administration, is being restored to its respectable standing among the comity of progressive nations. “The theme of the current General Assembly is ‘Galvanising Multilateral Efforts for Poverty Eradication, Quality Education, Climate Action and Inclusion’. “A stable and developed Nigeria is required to effectively support global efforts in combating and seeking solutions to equally global threats and challenges that we face,” the statement read in part.
