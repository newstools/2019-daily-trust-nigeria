The Intelligence Response Team (IRT) from the Police Headquarters in Abuja has arrested one  Fuski Angulu, suspected to be another kidnap kingpin  from Takum LGA of  Taraba State. A very reliable police source told Daily Trust that Fuski Angulu who was alleged to be behind most of the kidnappings and armed robberies in Takum, Donga and Wukari in Southern Taraba was arrested in Takum and taken to Abuja following a tip-off. The source further hinted that upon interrogation, Fuski mentioned one Idi Shaidan, a member of his gang based in Jalingo who also  mentioned a former government official and  a serving councilor in Jalingo. According to the police source, those mentioned were subsequently arrested and interrogated by the IRT team and their houses were searched. They were however released on bail while Idi Shaidan and other members of his gang were taken to the Force Headquarters in Abuja. Speaking to journalists in Jalingo, a former Special Adviser on MDGs, Salejo Damburan, denied allegations of involvement in any criminal activity. He confirmed his arrest by members of the IRT but said he was released two hours later after a written statement. Damburam said he knew Idi Shaidan as one of the boys terrorizing his house and water company in Jalingo. He said he reported Idi Shaidan to the DSS and the Special Anti Robbery Squad (SARS) in Jalingo, adding that Idi had vowed to implicate him.
