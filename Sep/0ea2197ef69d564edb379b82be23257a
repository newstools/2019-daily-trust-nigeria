The Election Petitions Tribunal sitting in Sokoto, yesterday, struck out a petition, challenging the election of Senator Ibrahim Abdullahi Gobir, representing Sokoto East Senatorial District. Salihu Maidaji, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate in the 2019 senatorial election conducted on 23 February, brought the petition. Maidaji is the immediate past Speaker of Sokoto State House of Assembly. In the petition, he alleged that Senator Gobir of the All Progressives Congress, (APC) did not score the majority of lawful votes cast and that, there was substantial non-compliance with the electoral laws. Maidaji also alleged that Gobir tendered forged certificate, thus was not qualified to have contested. In his judgment, chairman of the tribunal, Justice Peter Akhimie Akhihiero, dismissed the petition for lack of merit.
