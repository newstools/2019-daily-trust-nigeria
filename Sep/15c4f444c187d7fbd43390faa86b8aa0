The Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Arch. Olamilekan Adegbite, has said the ministry will provide Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the mining sector with logistics and equipment. Arch. Adegbite stated this when the Regional Director of the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO), Mr. Bakole Jean, paid a visit to the ministry yesterday. He said, “Under our MSMEs programme, we are trying to see how we can organise those people into cooperatives. Their productivity is low as individuals, but when you put them together as a group, their product becomes substantial enough and you can now begin to add value to them by bringing the value addition to where they are. For instance, we want to develop the local industry, we want to support them with logistics and equipment for their mining.”  Tackling MSMEs difficulties in accessing funds Artisanal miners association set to formalise small scale mining Nigeria gets database for small scale miners OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
