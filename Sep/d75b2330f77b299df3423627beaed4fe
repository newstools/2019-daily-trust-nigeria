Directors and deputy directors in the federal civil service are grumbling over the last Wednesday’s extension of tenure of service granted seven permanent secretaries by President Muhammadu Buhari. Senior civil servants in the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, the Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Federal Secretariat, yesterday expressed disappointment over the issue. The House of Representatives had, 18 months ago, passed a resolution condemning a similar extension for Dr Jamila Shu’ara, the then permanent secretary of the Ministry of Petroleum and ordered the then Head of Service Winfred Oyo-ita to retrieve the salaries paid to Shu’ara. Some of the directors, who cannot be named, due to the nature of this report, in separate interview said there is no way the extension can be justified. According to them, it was only fair that the retiring PSs be allowed to go and not to make it look as if they were indispensable. “If the others that retired were still there, there is no way they would have become permanent secretaries. This also make it to look as if they were the only one that were competent and others not,” one of the directors told Daily Trust in Abuja. Another said, “We are obviously loyal and have to follow the directives of any government in power, but to subvert the rule of law for political expediency, to please a few at the expense of the larger and collective interest is a bad precedence. “It is even funny that the circular you (referring to our correspondent) directed the Office of the Head of Service to commence selection process for new perm secs to replace all retiring ones, without mentioning those affected it were those whose tenure were extended of others whose times are close (for retirement).” Buhari fires Oyo-Ita, extends tenure of 7 perm secs Reps order ex-perm sec to return 1year salary JUST IN: Buhari fires Oyo-Ita, appoints Yemi-Esan acting HoS OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
