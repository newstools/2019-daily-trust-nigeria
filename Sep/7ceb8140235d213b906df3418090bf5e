Another governorship aspirant on the platform of the APC in Bayelsa State, Engr. Preye Aganaba, has rejected the outcome of the direct primary election in the state, describing it as a mockery of democratic process. Aganaba, in a statement yesterday in Yenagoa, also referred to the primaries that produced David Lyon as the candidate of the party as a political hoax and lacking any semblance of credibility. He alleged that the results were written in a hotel in Yenagoa, the state capital, instead of ward centres where elections were supposed to take place. He said the stakeholders agreed that names of returning officers should be published at ward levels, result sheets be available in the various local government areas and that tags should be provided for the eight local government agents and 105 ward agents. He said the chairman and secretary of the committee agreed to the demands but failed to honour them during the process that led to the primary election.
