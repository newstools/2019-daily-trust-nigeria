The adjournment was to enable the second respondent, Governor Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed, to open his defense. INEC closed its defense at the tribunalâ€™s sitting in Bauchi on Monday based on the petition filed by the former Governor of Bauchi state, Mohammed Abubakar, challenging the victory of the incumbent Governor Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed.
