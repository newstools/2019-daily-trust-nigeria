The Director said the six-day exercise covers 274 agencies, including tertiary institutions, health institutions, research institutions and the defunct Power Holding Company of Nigeria. The exercise was to enable PTAD to have a comprehensive, accurate and reliable database for pensioners under the Defined Benefit Scheme (DBS), he explained. Shelleng added that: “The database will be used to address some irregularities in the system, including ghost pensioners syndrome, duplicate payments, over and underpayments, among other needs. “PTAD aims at providing exceptional, transparent and technology-driven pension services through a competent and dedicated workforce.” Shelleng pointed out that PTAD does not ask for money, and cautioned the pensioners against any form of payments to fraudsters. He disclosed that the next phase of verification exercise in the series would be conducted before the end of the year and at designated places across the country.
