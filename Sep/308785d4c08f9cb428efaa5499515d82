The Principal Medical Officer (PMO) of the Snake Bite Treatment and Research Centre Kaltungo, Dr. Suleiman Muhammad, has said that the state government has supplied anti-snake bike venom to the hospital. Dr Mohammed, who confirmed this in a telephone interview with our correspondent, said the hospital had taken delivery of a consignment from the Central Medical Store. He said the shortage had caused some challenges to people in the area especially during this period when cases of snake bites are on the rise. He could, however, not say the quantity of the venom released to the hospital. When contacted the Permanent Secretary Ministry of Health, Hajiya Zainab Haruna, also confirmed that the government has supplied anti-snake venom to the hospital. She, however, did not disclose the quantity of the venom supplied to the hospital but assured that the ministry has enough stock to last the season. Hajiya Zainab added that the government would continue to do its best in tackling health related issues. In an earlier interview with North East Trust Dr Mohammed had said that the hospital had ran out of the venom and patients were being asked to buy from outside which costs N30,000 per single dose.
