The police in Ekiti State said they have arrested a 65-year-old man, Magaji  Oluwatoba, for allegedly sexually assaulting a 12-year-old girl. The police also confirmed the arrest of one  Alero Mohammed, 32, for forcefully having carnal knowledge of the same girl. Parading the two suspects on Tuesday at the police command headquarters in Ado-Ekiti, the Commissioner of Police, Mr Asuquo Amba, said the girl lived in the same house with Oluwatoba at No. 20, Irona Street, Ado-Ekiti.
