The Lagos State governor, Mr Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu has approved the re-establishment of a Parastatals Monitoring Office (PMO), just as he also re-designated his Special Adviser on Political and Legislative Affairs, Mr Afolabi Ayantayo, as its new Special Adviser. According to a circular release yesterday and signed by the Head of Service (HoS), Mr Hakeem Muri-Okunola, the re-designation and redeployment of Ayantayo, a journalist and writer-turned politician, took immediate effect. The PMO, among other duties, is saddled with the mandate of ensuring that parastatals in the state are managed and run in accordance with administrative guidelines. The Office is expected to routinely monitor the execution of capital projects of all parastatals and government-owned companies based on identified Key Performance Indicators (KPI) to ensure that the set targets are achieved. The PMO, which had been in existence since 1984, was rendered moribund during the last administration in the state, before its re-establishment by the present administration. The HoS explained that the re-establishment of the office would further harmonise the activities of the various parastatals and also align their operations to conform with the vision and policy thrust of the state government.
