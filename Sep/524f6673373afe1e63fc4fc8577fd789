The Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) should adopt a new strategy and partner other sister agencies of the government to stop its debtors from contesting elections in the country, Justice C.M.A. Olatoregun of the Federal High Court has said. Olatoregun who made the call at the weekend as Chairperson of a one day seminar for External Solicitors and Asset Management Partners (AMPs) of AMCON and organised by the firm of Legal Academy said now is the right time for AMCON to come up with a comprehensive database of its obligors and make such information available to bodies such as the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC); Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC);Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC); Department of State Security (DSS); Nigerian Police among other sister agencies of the government so that AMCON obligors can be stopped from contesting elections or aspiring to leadership positions in the country ab-initio. A statement from AMCOM said the jurist posited that when election is approaching, lawyers can boldly approach the court and get orders stopping such candidates from seeking votes from Nigerians, thereby helping the Nigerian economy. According to her, lawyers need to understand that the over N5trillion owed AMCON belongs to all Nigerians including the lawyers meaning that recovering the outstanding debt will have huge positive impact on the development of the economy of the country.
