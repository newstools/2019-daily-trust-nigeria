Three factions of the Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC) yesterday urged the Aare Onakakanfo of Yoruba Land, Otunba Gani Adams, never to drag OPC to partisan politics because it was known as a group saddled with the responsibility of defending the Yoruba nation. The group was apparently responding to a statement credited to Otunba Gani Adams that the OPC might later become a political party soon. The three factions of the group are OPC Fredrick Faseun, OPC New Era and OPC Reformed. The group in a statement by its publicity secretary, Adeshina Akinpelu, urged Gani Adams to use his name or any of the groups he had personally founded to float a political party rather than OPC. The statement said; “The statement credited to Gani Adams that Oodua Peoples Congress, OPC, might later become a political party is not only laughable but very disgusting. “Who is Gani Adams to decide the fates of millions of OPC members worldwide? Even Dr Fredrick Faseun, the founder of OPC didn’t attempt to transform OPC into political party while alive. We see it as a way of an ingrate trying to destroy the legacies of OPC’s founding fathers.”  You’re no longer OPC leader, factional groups tell Gani Adams OPC leaders query Gani Adams over Jonathan’s N1.6bn campaign fund OPC leaders query Gani Adams over Jonathan’s N1.6bn campaign fund OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
