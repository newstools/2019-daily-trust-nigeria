About N3.3trillion abandoned projects across the country can be reduced drastically if the government at all levels embrace the culture of effective and efficient project management, the Project Management Conference (ProMaCon) stakeholders have said. The stakeholders who spoke yesterday in Abuja at a press conference to announce ProMaCon’s 10th anniversary scheduled for November said Nigeria had suffered great losses in human, material and financial resources through decades due to poorly managed projects. The Chief Executive Officer iCentra Consulting, Taopheek Babayeju, who is one of the coordinators of ProMaCon, said the practice of project management played a very important role in national development. ‘’It is more so in the current competitive global economy where societies are being radically changed through myriads of successful projects that cut across all economic sectors’’, Babayeju said. Advanced economies are being differentiated by the sheer audacity of innovative projects they have conceived and completed, he said. According to him, the many abandoned projects scattered across the country and infamous concept of White Elephant project are pointers to the urgent need for the country to embrace the culture of effective and efficient project management. ‘’It is in consideration of the foregoing that the first National Project Management Conference  (ProMaCon) was convened in 2009 where stakeholders in the project management profession gathered to deliberate on how to institutionalise project management best practice in Nigeria’’, he said. The objective of the gathering, he said, had been among other things to address the challenges bedevilling effective project delivery across all sectors in the country. Other stakeholders who spoke at the event include  Lead Consultant/CEO Management Edge Limited, Ayodeji Abitogun; CEO Marvel Matrix Plus Limited, Phil Okoroafor; and Project Manager Xstrata Professional Services Limited, Chigozie Ndekile.
