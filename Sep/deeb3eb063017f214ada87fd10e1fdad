Allied Peoples Movement (APM) says it has concluded plans to file an appeal against the judgment of the Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal which dismissed the petition it filed alongside its candidate, Adekunle Akinlade. The Justice Yusuf Halilu-led panel had dismissed the petition filed against Governor Dapo Abiodun’s victory in the March 9 election over the petitioners’ failure to prove the allegations. Addressing newsmen in Abeokuta, the Acting Publicity Secretary of APM, Olumide Balogun, said the party would appeal the judgment which he described as a “miscarriage of justice.” Akinlade had hinted that the party would decide whether or not to appeal after reviewing details of the judgment. But Balogun, while speaking said: “Our notice of appeal will be filed at the appropriate time in accordance with the law.” Ogun: Tribunal quashes Akinlade, APM's objection to Abiodun's qualification Gov’ship polls: Lado, Ashiru, others head to appeal court S/Court upholds Dickson’s election OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
