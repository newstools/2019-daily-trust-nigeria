He said INEC would receive all nominations at its Media Centre, INEC Headquarters, Abuja and that all nominations must be received latest 6pm today, September 9, 2019. “The commission shall publish the names and votes scored by all the candidates that participated in the primaries monitored by our officials in the two states. “We enjoin all the political parties participating in the election to strictly comply with the timelines earlier released by the commission as it will not entertain any late submission under any circumstances,” he said.
