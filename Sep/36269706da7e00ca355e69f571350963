The immediate past Governor of Bauchi State, Barrister Muhammed Abdullahi Abubakar, has directed his lawyers to institute civil action against Alhaji Bibi Dogo and Alhaji Yakubu Jibrin to prove their allegation of corruption against him when he was governor. Dogo and Jibrin had, last week at a press conference in Bauchi, given a three-day ultimatum to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to either commence investigation and prosecute the former governor over allegation of corruption against him while in office or they were going to be forced to sue the agency. Dogo said they had submitted several petitions to EFCC on the corrupt practices of the former governor after he assumed duty and obtained a N4bn loan.
