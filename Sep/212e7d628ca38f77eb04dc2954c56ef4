The Peoples Party of Nigeria (PPN) has elected Pharm. Joseph Idachaba as its flag bearer in the forthcoming November governorship poll in Kogi State. Idachaba emerged as a consensus candidate of the party, yesterday, during the party’s governorship primary held in Lokoja, the state capital. In his acceptance speech, Chief Idachaba promised to transform the state within a short time in office, saying that with abundant human and natural resources, the state has no reason to be poor. He expressed confidence in the ability of PPN to dislodge the incumbent in the November governorship poll. According to him, bad leadership was responsible for the slow pace of development in the state, adding that his reason for joining the race was to make a difference in governance by speedily turning around the fortunes of the state for the overall wellbeing of the people.
