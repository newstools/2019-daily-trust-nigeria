The Potiskum Truck Transit Park (PTTP) will generate at least 3,000 direct jobs and several hundred indirect jobs when functional. The Executive Secretary, Nigerian Shippers Council (NSC), Bar. Hassan Bello disclosed this, yesterday, during the foundation stone laying ceremony of the facility in Potiskum, Yobe State. Besides the job opportunities, he said the facility would impact the economy of Potiskum in particular and Yobe State in general. He said the facility is tipped to be the largest in Northern Nigeria and will be patronized by about 300 trucks daily. “The Truck Transit Park is a modern road transport infrastructure designed for the safety of cargo and standardization of truck driving. It is a public rest area located off the road, designed to provide temporary rest location for drivers,” the ES explained. He said the Potiskum TTP will be private sector driven and regulated by the Infrastructure Concession and Regulatory Commission (ICRC). He listed the benefits of a Truck Transit Park (TTP) to include; improvement in road freight transportation industry in general; facilitation of trade and consequent increase in internal revenue generation by the state government, promotion of new socio-economic activities, acceleration of economic growth, productivity and competitiveness; and creation of employment opportunities – both direct and indirect jobs. He said there are presently 22 approved Truck Transit Parks (TTP’s) locations. Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, who performed the foundation stone laying exercise, said the Potiskum TTP is a testimony of his campaign promise. He promised to support the facility to make it a reality.
