Fulani elders in Toto Local Government Area of Nasarawa State have invoked wrath on any youth that engages in crime of whatever sort. The invocation which is known as ‘Fulaco Combo’ was held at the Central Pilot Primary School in Ugya town, Toto LGA of the state. The Fulaco was performed by Modibbo Alhaji Bisalla who said, “This is a belief by all Fulani people. An invocation can be made, and whoever defies it will not know peace in his lifetime. This is done to find a lasting solution to the incessant cases of kidnapping, cattle rustling, robbery and rape among other vices.” In his remarks, Baba Chiroma Hussaini said, “Every peace loving Fulani is saddened by this latest and ugly development which is contrary to our legacy as Fulani. Criminality has never being our way of life.” He added that the  gathering was to draw a battle line between the good and bad eggs. Chairman of  the local government, Nuhu Dauda, assured the Fulani of his administration’s readiness to partner with organizations and individuals to flush out criminals in the local government area.
