Senator Emmanuel Orker Jev (PDP, Benue North West) has said that those speculating frosty relationship between him and Governor Samuel Ortom over the senatorial seat come 2023 would be ‘terribly’ disappointed. In the political arena in the state, there have been reports that Jev and the governor who is serving a second term would soon fall apart over the latter’s alleged ambition to contest the Senate seat on expiration of his tenure in the next political dispensation. But Jev, currently serving his first term at the Senate, dispelled the speculation while answering questions from newsmen in Makurdi, the state capital. “I heard the speculation on social media and elsewhere that I and the governor will fight in 2023 over Senate. I think people will be terribly disappointed if they are expecting a fight between me and the governor. We will be close allies until the end of our tenure,” he said. Jev noted that he has four years mandate at the Senate which he can’t take lightly, adding, “I’m taking it with a whole lot of responsibility. I won’t bother myself about what happens thereafter. I think what we pray for is long life and prosperity.” He also debunked allegations that he was planning to dump the PDP for another political party, describing it as an attempt by some people to cause confusion. The senator also restated that the Minister of Special Duties, George Akume, who he (Jev) defeated in the recent election remained his leader. “I’m not in contention with him (Akume) for leadership. He is still my leader and I hope he (Akume) sees it that way,” he said.  2023 senatorship: Jev speaks on potential clash with Gov.
