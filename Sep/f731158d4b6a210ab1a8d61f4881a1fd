Yobe and other ‎states in the North East have been urged to support Bauchi State to produce the next national secretary of the ruling APC. An APC chieftain in Bauchi State, Dr Sama’ila Dahuwa Azare (Kachallan Katagum), made the call in an interview with our reporter in Bauchi at the weekend. Dr Azare, who is also interested in the position, said conceding the seat to Bauchi‎ State would be a strategic move that would strengthen the APC not only in the state but the North East and the country in general.

It also has the Senate president and some other political appointees. Borno State, of course, ‎has a governor who is also of APC and very strong appointees of this administration. Although Adamawa does not have an APC governor, it has the national vice chairman and the SGF. Gombe State has an APC governor and quite a number of appointments. “Yes, Bauchi State, we lost the election. Our state is now in the hands of the PDP. And don’t forget, in the whole of North East, Bauchi produced the largest votes to the president. We have the largest votes for APC in Bauchi, more than all the states. More than the rest of the states,” he added.
