The Oyo State chapter of the  Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday traded words over the victory of the governor of the state, Seyi Makinde, at the tribunal. PDP in a statement by the party chairman, Alhaji  Kunmi Mustapha, said the judiciary should be commended for upholding the wishes of the people as demonstrated by the pattern of voting in the last gubernatorial election by declaring Engr Seyi Makinde the winner. According to the party, the Oyo State gubernatorial election petition tribunal, by its landmark ruling, had helped to restore hope to Nigerians that judgment is not for sale. Kunmi Mustapha saluted the judges for putting honesty, justice and fear of God above any other considerations to carry out their professional callings. But the Oyo state APC said it received the judgement of the March 9, 2019 gubernatorial poll with dismay. The party, in a statement by its spokesman, Dr. Azeez Olatunde, said the “State Working Committee of the party in its proactive manner has decided to refer the tribunal ruling to our team of legal experts for necessary recommendation” which the party hopes to follow appropriately. “Oyo APC will like to thank our members for being law abiding and wishes to assure them and our sympathizers to please await the next line of action, in due course,”  it said.
