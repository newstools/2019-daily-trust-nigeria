The National Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal sitting in Owerri has affirmed the election of Senator Ben Uwajumogu as the senator representing Imo North senatorial district. In a unanimous decision led by Justice DS Wyom, the tribunal said the petitions filed by the candidates of Action Alliance (AA) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) respectively were frivolous and lacking in merit. It stated that the petitioners were unable to prove their cases beyond reasonable doubt. The petitioners had asked the tribunal to annul Uwajumogu’s election on the ground that it was inconclusive. Speaking on his victory, Senator Uwajumogu praised the judiciary for standing by the truth in affirming his victory at the last Imo North Senatorial elections. He appealed to his opponents to join hands with him in attracting dividends of democracy to Imo North and not appeal the judgement.
