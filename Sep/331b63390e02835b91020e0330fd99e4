The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has cautioned the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) against any attempt to use “its extrapolations on violence” as cover and justification to manipulate the November 16 governorship election in Kogi State. The party also asked critical stakeholders in the polity, including INEC, to warn Governor Yahiya Bello and the All Progressives Congress (APC) to desist from any act of violence in the election, adding that the people of the state were at alert and fully prepared to confront the governor and his party on all fronts. The PDP, in a statement yesterday, through its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, claimed that it was already aware of alleged “ heinous plots” by the governor to orchestrate violence as a strategy to manipulate and win the election. The party however said violence cannot save Bello and his party, APC, from crushing defeat at the polls. “The PDP wants INEC and Governor Yahaya Bello to note that the November 16 election is a determined march by the people against a suppressive, cruel, chaotic, sadistic, acrimonious and inhuman administration. “It is a determined march against acute poverty, hunger and starvation, fear, general low life and despondency in the state, which Governor Yahaya Bello and the APC represent,” the party said.
