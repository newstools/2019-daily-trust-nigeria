A former governor of Cross-River State, Donald Duke, says he has paid the N340million debt to the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON). Mr Duke, in a statement yesterday, said his indebtedness to AMCON was only dramatised because he had disagreed with the corporation on the debt’s sum. He said: ‘’Recently, an obligation I had  to AMCON has made the news. Whilst I do not understand the excitement this has generated, bearing in mind that debts far in excess of this have not received a whisper, clearly some people are having fun at my expense, nevertheless, I think it appropriate  now that the issue has been laid to rest, to state my side of the matter, considering the fervour the story generated. ‘’AMCON made a claim of N569m against me which I disputed. I guess to arm twist me they proceeded to court and created a media circus.  Having done what I consider their worst, I insisted on what I believe is the correct amount. We have since agreed to this amount and  the sum of N340m has been  paid. I hope this takes the air off the sail of those who made a mountain out of a molehill.  There was nothing to be excited about after all. ‘’ page 26  INTERVIEW  BUSINESS FG will no longer do business with AMCON debtors - Osinbajo Reps foreclose acquisition of new debt by AMCON OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
