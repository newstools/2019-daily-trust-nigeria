Three police vehicles were vandalised by some angry mob who attempted to invade a Shoprite located at Alieta, along Airport road in Abuja. The mob, who were in their large numbers, positioned themselves between Lugbe bridge down to Alieta, set a bonfire on both sides of the road, which resulted in heavy gridlock. Our reporter, who was caught up in the gridlock observed that the mob were hurling stones on police patrol vehicles including some unlucky private vehicles, whose windscreen were shattered. Tension became high when some police men drafted to the scene to prevent the mob from having access into Shoprite shot into the air to disperse them but members of the mob continued hurling stones in the direction of the police men. It was also observed that some motorists between Lugbe federal housing junction were forced to make a u-turn as a result of the violent action of the mob. The spokesman of the FCT police command, DSP Anjuguri Manza, was yet to pick calls put across his phone.
