Chairman of the FCT chapter of Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN), Alhaji Abubakar Dahiru Zuba, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari over the closure of borders to checkmate importation of rice into the country. Zuba, who spoke with newsmen in Gwagwalada, yesterday, said the decision by the federal government to close the borders was in the best interest of the country, adding that the move would enhance the production of rice and boost the economy. He said the association had given soft loans, assorted rice seedlings, chemicals, sprayers, tractors and other farm inputs to local rice farmers across the six area councils in order to boost rice farming in the FCT. “I want to tell you that RIFAN is fully in support of President Muhammadu Buhari’s move in closing down the land borders, which we believe will encourage rice farming in Nigeria and boost the country’s economy,” Zuba said.
