The federal government has urged the contractor handling the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge rail line to speed up the work to enable the commencement of free train services from Lagos to Ibadan by November. Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi stated this when he inspected the project alongside the Minister of State, Sen. Gbemisola Rukayyat Saraki. This was the first time Saraki would join Amaechi in inspecting the $2.1bn project – the star project in the Ministry of Transportation. According to him, the contractor, China Civil Engineering and Construction Corporation (CCECC), reduced the pace of work when the former cabinet was dissolved. “They (contractor) need to increase their speed. They reduced their speed within the period that the government dissolved the last cabinet. “Now that we are back, my colleague, the minister of state and I resolved to push back the pressure to ensure completion. “Our ambition is that by November we should begin trial of train services between Lagos and Ibadan for free. “CCECC has not done too well. I used the phrase too well because at a time, they did us proud by trying to push this job. They claimed that at the end of the last government, we owed them some money and we had not given approvals for the extra and additional jobs. But that’s not an excuse because we will still have given the approval. So they have slowed down so badly. “We need to get them to that speed that they were on before the last government was dissolved,” Amaechi said.
