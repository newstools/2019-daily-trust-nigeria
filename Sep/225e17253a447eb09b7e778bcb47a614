Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has paid tribute to the late former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe. Osinbajo spoke with Zimbabwean journalists who approached him on arrival at the Harare International Airport on Friday night to attend the funeral of the late African leader. He said the late Mugabe stood out as a leader because of his zeal, passion and selfless commitment to the emancipation of the people of Zimbabwe and the self realization of black people everywhere. Osinbajo said the memories of the years of struggle for black majority rule in various places brought joy and confidence to most Africans, especially leaders of today. A release issued yesterday by Laolu Akande, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Office of the Vice President, quoted Osinbajo as saying that “I think that for most of us, especially those who are leaders today, there’s a lot to learn from such an incredibly illustrious career, especially the role that he played in decolonization. And, of course, alongside the work that was done, not just by the frontline states, but by the likes of Nelson Mandela in South Africa and so many other African patriots; their lives and times, especially during the period of the struggle for black majority rule in Southern Africa and the support that other African countries gave, especially sub-Saharan African countries; Nigeria being, as you’ve noted, a frontline state. There are times when I think we should be extremely proud of what we achieved as black people.”  Mugabe had an incredibly illustrious career - Osinbajo Mugabe’s legacy of black emancipation will live long in hearts of Africans–Osinbajo Osinbajo to represent Nigeria at Mugabe's state burial OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
