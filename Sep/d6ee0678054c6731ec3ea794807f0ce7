Minister of State for FCT, Dr. Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu, has said that the administration will focus more on the completion of abandoned projects especially in the satellite towns. She said the FCT Administration wishes to give priority to the completion of all abandoned projects. Aliyu stated this when she met with heads of the secretariat, departments and agencies under her supervision last Friday, in Abuja. She also stressed the importance of synergy among all relevant agencies for the speedy development of the satellite towns. “Besides, our meeting today was very fruitful and rewarding, because all the heads of departments were frank and honest in their presentations. We have been able to identify their challenges, areas of need and the way forward. “And one of the areas identified is that of numerous abandoned projects especially in the area councils where majority of the FCT residents reside. “And in line with President Muhammadu Buhari’s mandate, we have to focus more on the completion of all abandoned projects instead of awarding new ones,” she said. She added “the wisdom behind this directive is that government is a continuum and if we continue to award fresh projects, there is tendency that Nigeria will inherit more abandoned projects in the near future which is not healthy for our development.” Abandoned projects: Challenges before new FCT minister page 29 Kuje-Gwagwalada road: Motorists’nightmare OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
