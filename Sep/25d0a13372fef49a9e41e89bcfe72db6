He said the Agro Rangers team was informed by the decision of the federal government to diversify from oil to agriculture. He then assured that the Service was ready to partner with relevant security agencies to tackle banditry. “Now that the presidency is diversifying the economy of the country from oil to agriculture, an Agro Rangers team has been established to ensure protection of farmers and agricultural products across the country. “We have had many attacks on citizens which we are supposed to be protecting and that calls for serious concern; that is why the Commandant General charged us to be proactive’’ he said. He said the personnel have been trained locally and internationally on weapon handling.
