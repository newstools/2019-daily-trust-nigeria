The Executive Secretary of Anti-Corruption and Research Based Data Initiative (ARDI), Chief Dennis Emeka Aghanya, has urged Igbo politicians to desist from chasing President Muhammadu Buhari’s certificate and instead strategize for the 2023 presidency. He said yesterdsy in Abuja that it was worrisome to see the comments and reactions after the presidential election tribunal gave its judgement on the Buhari/Atiku case on Wednesday. According to him, all over the social media, his fellow Igbo brethren were at the forefront of the agitation for President Buhari’s certificate as if that would settle the political problem or guarantee Igbo presidency. ‘Igbos should strategize for 2023’ 2019: Igbo support for Buhari unshakable, says Nwosu Atiku's endorsement: APC cautions against politicisation of Ohaneze Ndigbo OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
