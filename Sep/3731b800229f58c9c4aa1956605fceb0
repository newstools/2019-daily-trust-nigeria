One of Nigeria’s leading domestic airlines, Dana Air, has taken possession of its first ever B737-300 aircraft, with the move seen as a strategic step to diversify its fleet base and position itself for route expansion. The 737 aircraft, the most common plane used by the country’s domestic operators, was a turning point in the operation of Dana Airline which has been operating with the McDonnel Douglas (MD083) aircraft. The new aircraft with registration number 5N-DNA and a configuration of 143 passengers arrived the Murtala Mohammed International Airport (MMIA) from Italy last weekend. The Managing Director/Chief Executive officer of Dana Air, Jacky Hathiramani, said the arrival of the first Boeing 737 aircraft was part of its promise to its customers earlier in the year that the airline would acquire some Boeing 737 aircraft to increase its capacity and meet their ever increasing demands. Hathiramani said Dana Air was committed to its strategic route expansion and fleet renewal plan, and its desire to continue to provide unmatched on-time performance, world-class in-flight services and seamless air travel to its teeming customers. According to the MD, there is an ongoing plan to increase the airline’s fleet size to nine before the end of the year. The Chief Operating Officer (COO) and Accountable Manager of Dana, Obi Mbanuzor, said the second Boeing aircraft numbered 5N-DNB would arrive Nigeria in a few weeks. Besides, he talked of plans to phase out the MD83 aircraft which the airline had used since the commencement of its operations. According to him, the airline went through a long road to acquire the Boeing 737 aircraft to satisfy the yearnings of its guests.
