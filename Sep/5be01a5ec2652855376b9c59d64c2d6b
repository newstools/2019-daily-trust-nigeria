The Ijaws say it is their turn to produce the next managing director of the Niger Delta Development Commission based on the rotational arrangement guiding appointments into the commission. A statement yesterday by the chairman of the assembly, Chief Ebipade Gbegha and the secretary, Ogbein Zidideke, described as “provocative”, the recent nomination of an Urhobo national as the Managing Director of the NDDC instead of an Ijaw person. “The Urhobos have produced two MDs and currently the outgoing Executive position too. For them (the Urhobo) to produce MD again for the third time is an anathema to equity, fairness and natural justice,” they said. They quoted the section 12 (1) of the NDCC Act 2000 to justify their position: “There shall be  for the commission, a managing director and two executive directors who shall be indigenes of oil producing areas starting with members state of the commission with the highest production quantum of oil and shall rotate among member states in the order of production.” They said: “If there is a position of MD or any other position of executive director or chairman allotted to Delta State, it should be the rightful turn of the Ijaws and not Urhobos, because the Ijaws are the highest producers of oil in Delta State.” They called on President Muhammadu Buhari to appoint an Ijaw man to head the commission. “The injustice, marginalization and oppression meted on the Ijaws have been too loud and painful,” they said.
