Religious bodies, under the auspices of Interfaith Mediation Center (IMC), an NGO, have met with politicians in Jema’a local government area of Kaduna State to brainstorm on ways to attain “Zero Corruption”. Dr James Wuye, an Executive Director of the Organisation, in an opening address at the meeting tagged; “Engaging Faith based Platforms on the fight Against Corruption,” said it was meant to promote a working relationship among members to collectively identify ways to reduce the menace of corruption. “This meeting would also enhance opportunity for communities to engage with elected officials to promote good governance and development. Also, Imam Muhammad Nurain Ashafa, Co-Executive Director of IMC said the interaction would focus on individual, societal and organisational factors related to the causes of corruption. “Other pertinent areas we will focus on are social, political and economic effects of corruption with the aim of brainstorming that would culminate with an action plan,” he said. Rev. Father John Mark, the CAN Chairman, Jema’a local government area, said one of the ways to rid corruption was to expose those who engage in the practice. Alhaji Iliyasu Musa, Secretary of JNI in Jema’a regretted that the holy books of both the Christian and Muslim faiths had only become ceremonial as elected officials no longer live by the oath they take upon assumption of their respective offices.
