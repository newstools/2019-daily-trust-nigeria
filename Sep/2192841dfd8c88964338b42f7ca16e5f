The National and State Houses of Assembly Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Kano has upheld the victory of the member representing Albasu/Ajingi/Gaya Federal Constituency, Abdullahi Mahmud Gaya. Gaya was dragged before the tribunal by Usman Mahmud Adamu of PDP, challenging his victory on grounds of corrupt practices, over voting and allocation of votes to non-participating parties among others. In its ruling, the three-man panel led by Hon. Justice Ajoke Adepoju held that the petitioner failed to sufficiently prove the allegations filed against the respondents, and thereby dismissed it. Similarly, the tribunal has affirmed the election of Rep Abdulmumin Jibrin of APC as the winner of Bebeji/Kiru Federal constituency of Kano State in the February 27, 2019 election. In a unanimous judgment, the tribunal chaired by Justice Nayai Aganaba unanimously dismissed the petition filed by Aliyu Datti Yako and the PDP challenging the victory of Jibrin as winner of the election. The tribunal held that the petitioners failed to prove the allegations as contained in their petitions against the respondents. Yako and his party, PDP, had dragged Jibrin, his party, APC and INEC before the tribunal, challenging the result of the Bebeji/Kiru Federal Constituency election over alleged irregularities. APC and INEC were second and third respondents respectively. Yako had alleged that INEC wrongly declared Jibrin as the winner of the poll with 41,700 votes, while he was said to have scored 40,385 votes. ...sacks Ogun APC Rep, validates Senator Odebiyi's election Gyang, Gagdi scale through at tribunal in Plateau Kano: Tribunal upholds victory of Doguwa, Kofa, Nass OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
