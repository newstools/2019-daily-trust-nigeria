The All Progressives Congress (APC) has alleged that the presence of campaign posters of its key leaders for the 2023 presidential race are part of the strategies of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to cause confusion. APC National Publicity Secretary Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, who addressed journalists yesterday in Abuja, said it was an attempt to divert the attention of the governing party from focusing on the challenges of governance, security, economy and corruption as well as other associated issues which were important to Nigerians. “As a party, we want to state clearly that having won elections convincingly and having been given the mandate to run government for the next four years, our major and only focus now is governance. “We are not engaging in any other activity about 2023 elections and wherever you see such (posters) you can be sure they are from mischief makers and of course we know it is part of the strategy of the PDP to continue to take actions to cause distractions for the governing party,” he said.
