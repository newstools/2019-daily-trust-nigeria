Chiya, while presenting the items to mark his administration’s 100 days in office yesterday, also donated motorcycles and sewing machines to youths and women in the council. He said he planned it as a surprise to showcase the  modest achievements” his administration has recorded since he assumed office on 29 May, 2019. He said the farm inputs would encourage the farmers in their activities in their respective communities. According to him, the programmes executed so far by his administration; infrastructure and human capital development, would impact positively on the lives of residents of the council. “You will agree with me that the development of every society is affected by the leadership style of this administrative structure as team work is a watch word of this administration,” he said. The chairman, therefore, urged the beneficiaries of the items to make good use of them, while expressing appreciation to residents of the council for their support for the administration. Also speaking, the chairman of the APC in the FCT, Alhaji Abdulmalik Usman, congratulated the APC-led administration of the council for embarking on viable projects within 100 days.
