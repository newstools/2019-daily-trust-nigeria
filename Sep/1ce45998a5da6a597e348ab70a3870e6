The Federal Government has directed three agencies under the Ministry of Communications to begin the process of getting International Standard Organisation (ISO) certification. The Minister of Communications, Dr Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami gave the directive at the presentation of ISO 2700: 2013 to the National Information and Technology Agency (NITDA) in Abuja yesterday. Dr Ibrahim Pantami said getting a truly deserved certification would stand the agencies out and would get them recognition globally. He said the agencies under his ministry should stop the old ways of doing things and start taking their mandates to the next level. He said the heads of the agencies should make their staff understand that they could lose their jobs if they perform below standard. ‘’ISO certification changes the perception of staff of any agency that has received it. I saw this myself when I was in NITDA and it has been testified to by many people. I believe these is no single staff of NITDA that this certification has not changed significantly’’, he added. He said it was gladdening that more companies and public institutions in Africa were getting ISO certifications. Earlier, the Director General of NITDA, Dr Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi, said the agency went through a rigorous process to get the ISO  certification.
