The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in collaboration with the European Centre for Electoral Supports (ECES) has commenced a two-day training for its electoral officers and assistant electoral officers in Kogi State on the Election Monitoring and Support Centre (EMSC) ahead of the November 16 governorship election in the state. Declaring the workshop open, yesterday in Lokoja, a National Commissioner of INEC, Mrs Amina Zakari, said the training was part of the commission’s preparation towards ensuring a hitch free governorship election in the state. She said the workshop was aimed at strengthening the electoral officers’ knowledge on their role in the forthcoming election. Zakari explained that EMSC, which was an integrated structure of the Election Management System (EMS), was a vital part of the 2019 General Elections which assisted the commission in tracking the implementation status of electoral activities for compliance monitoring and readiness assessment. Also speaking, INEC’s National Commissioner in charge of Kogi, Kwara and Nasarawa, Malam Mohammed Haruna, said after the training workshop, affected staff numbering about 108 should have become more knowledgeable in early identification of challenges through its data driven system for effective election plan.
