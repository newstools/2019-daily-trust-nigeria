The Department of Outdoor Advertisement and Signage (DOAS) of the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) is rebranding and has set a target to generate at least N1 billion in a year. The Director of DOAS, Dr Baba-Gana Adam, stated this when he paid a courtesy call to Media Trust Limited, publishers of the Daily Trust tittles, yesterday. Adam, who led the Director of Administration and Finance of the department, Mr Gabriel Ojo, Director, Business Development, Alhaji Mustapha Bagudu, and others to the corporate headquarters of the newspaper, was received by the deputy Managing  Editor, Malam Nasir Imam. He said the department was rebranding to serve the purpose for which it was created, which is to regulate and standardize the placement of advertisements and signages in the FCT. He said though the department had funding, staffing and infrastructural challenges, it was working towards generating N1 billion revenue in one year, starting from May 2019 to May 2020, stressing that it had already realised N200 million in three months. Adam said the department has only 46 staff which was not enough to cover the 62 wards in the territory, but reiterated that the department under him was determined to expand its operations in terms of coverage and enforcement. He also said the activities of touts, who were supported by politicians and other interested parties, were a major challenge to their resolve to reposition the department for optimal performance and service delivery. “We are constrained in our revenue drive by not only the aforementioned challenges, touts are a major hindrance, as illegal tax collectors move about with fake enforcement agencies,” he said. He, however, said the department was working hard to get autonomy so that it would move from being a department into an agency as part of strategies to generate more revenue.a Appropriate funding for FCT DOAS ‘FCTA loses N2.1bn to outdoor advertisers annually’ FCTA DOAS and the N3bn revenue challenge OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
