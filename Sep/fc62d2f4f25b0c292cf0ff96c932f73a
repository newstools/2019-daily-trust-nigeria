Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) has called for cooperation from its customers to tackle its challenges. A statement by the spokesman, Ibrahim Shawai on Monday said the challenges include “the lackadaisical attitude of most customers towards payment of bills, massive illegal connection, and meter bypass”. “KEDCO is willing and ready to give effective and efficient electricity to all its customers but the identified challenges are not good for the business. No business can be 100 per cent effective to such enviable capacity with the kind of environment that we are now faced with,” it noted. The DisCo said between January and August, there is an outstanding N11 billion bill because over 70 per cent of the customers do not pay their bills in full.
