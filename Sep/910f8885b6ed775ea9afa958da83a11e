…commissions 125 patrol cars, 35 motorcycles  The governor of Lagos State, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has re-stated his administration’s commitment towards ensuring that Lagos is crime-free. Sanwo-Olu made this known yesterday at the commissioning of 125 patrol cars and 35 patrol motorcycles for the use of security operatives in the state. The governor noted that the Lagos State Security Trust Fund (LSSTF) initiative the state introduced 13 years ago had paid off so well that the federal government intended to replicate it. According to him, the idea of creating a security trust fund had worked well for the state, noting that the donation of the cars and motorcycles would rejuvenate his administration’s plan at ensuring maximum security for the people of Lagos. Sanwo-Olu reiterated that security of lives and property was central to his administration and stated his resolve to support all outfits responsible for safety. “Lagos will continue to remain safe. Lagos will continue to be a place security will not be taken for granted. We will be passing 120 pick-up vehicles and about 35 motorcycles to our various security formations. This is just the beginning. We know that security is everybody’s concern and that is why we, as a government, have seen the need for this today,” he said. He advised parents to ensure their wards were not used by people with criminal intentions, “as necessary organs of government are adequately equipped to handle all issues at hand.” The governor, reacting to the recent reprisal attacks by some people in Lagos against xenophobia in South Africa, warned residents to shun criminality and lawlessness, saying “no one should be found on the other side of the law”.
