The Election Petition Tribunal  sitting in Awka, Anambra State, yesterday, upheld the  victories  of Sen Uche Ekwunife and Sen Ifeanyi Ubah of  Anambra  Central  and Anambra South senatorial districts  respectively. Sen Victor Umeh of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Sen Andy Uba of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Chief Chris Uba of the Peoples  Democratic Party (PDP) had approached the tribunal challenging the victories  of Sen Uche Ekwunife of the PDP and Sen Ifeanyi Ubah of Young Progressives Party (YPP)  during the February 23, 2019 general elections. They had prayed the tribunal to nullify the  elections on the  grounds of irregularities, multiple voting and other irregularities. Umeh had also told  the tribunal that Ekwunife was not qualified to contest for the election, having not officially resigned from APGA at the time. Delivering it’s judgement, the tribunal ruled that on the issue of the candidacy of Ekwunife , the matter is a pre-election matter and did not fall within its jurisdiction. On the petition filed against Ifeanyi Ubah by Chris Uba, the tribunal dismissed all the 19 witnesses brought by the petitioner.
