A former state chairman of Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC), Mr Goddie Akpama, has said that packs of packaged toothpicks produced in Cross River State, have changed his perception about the state governor,  Ben Ayade. Akpama said in a statement that he was pleasantly surprised over the weekend when he travelled to a local government area in the state and stumbled on the items and commended the state government, noting that it is credible. The former governorship candidate said, “I know a lot of people would express surprise at this opinion of mine on this matter. In fact, I believe that there would be so much speculation about what may have prompted me in this regard, but no one should get worked up over this. “This is entirely about how I feel about this development. It’s my opinion and the essence is to drive the message that I am not being negative towards the state government. I am not out to destroy the government but to hold it accountable, and ensure it implements programmes and policies that would be to the benefit of the people,” Akpama said. He called on the government to replicate the toothpick factory, and that the people should patronise it, saying it can contribute to boosting the state economy.
