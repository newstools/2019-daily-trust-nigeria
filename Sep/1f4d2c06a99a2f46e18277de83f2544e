The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON), yesterday, raided major outlets selling electrical materials in Sagamu, Ogun State and confiscated items suspected to be fake and substandard. The SON officials raided about 10 shops where fake electrical materials were seized. Some of the items seized were unbranded, while others had fake brands. The Director General of SON, Mr Osita Aboloma, told Daily Trust that the raid was carried out as part of efforts to end trade onÂ  fake electrical materials, which according to him, have been putting the lives of Nigerians in danger. Represented by the State Coordinator, Ogun State Office II, Engineer Olarewaju Onipede, Aboloma vowed that the raid would continue until the outlet owners adhered strictly to standards of the regulatory body. The DG expressed concern that substandard electrical materials have led to fire outbreaks in many homes leading to loss of lives and property. Aboloma explained that the regulatory body would carry out further investigation on the confiscated items and if found to be fake, the outlets would be sealed.
