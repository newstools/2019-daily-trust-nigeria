Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, may have settled for his Chief of Staff , Edward David Onoja, as his running mate ahead of the November 16 governorship election. Bello emerged the governorship flag bearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at the party’s primary held in Lokoja on August 29. Daily Trust learnt from credible sources yesterday that the name of Onoja had been submitted to the APC national secretariat as Bello’s running mate. Onoja’s photos had been seen side by side with that of the governor in most of the posters/billboards on display across the state. Governor Bello and his deputy, Simon Achuba, have been at loggerheads for some time now and the current development may have sealed the fate of Achuba ahead of the forthcoming election. When contacted, the Director General, Media and Publicity to the Governor, Kingsley Fanwo said he is yet to be briefed on the development. He, however, said that it might be true as those who were privy to the nomination forms filled by the Governor at the APC’s national secretariat might have leaked the information. “Anyway, I think it’s true but I have not been officially briefed , ” Fanwo said.
