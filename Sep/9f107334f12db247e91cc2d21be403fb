The chairman of Gwagwalada Area Council, Alhaji Adamu Mustapha, has called on residents of the area council to adhere strictly to building plans in order to avoid flood wreaking havoc on their houses. Mustapha made the call, yesterday, when he led some officials of the FCT Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on a visit to some flood affected areas and houses at Dagiri community of the council. He also advised residents to avoid blocking waterways, saying dumping of refuse in drainage caused flooding in many of the areas. The chairman, who sympathised with the victims of the flood, assured that the council was putting in place a palliative measure to cushion the effect of the disaster on the affected residents. He also said the area council was working with relevant agencies to get assistance, even as he said the council had concluded arrangements to flag-off enlightenment andÂ  sensitization of residents against flood in the area. According to him, the programme, which would take place today, was expected to last for three days across the 10 political wards of the council.
