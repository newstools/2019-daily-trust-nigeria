FCT Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Ayuba Wobin Gora, has said the sector will arrest motorists who disconnect the speed limiter device installed on their vehicles. He said the sector would continue to enforce the use of speed limiter device on vehicles in the territory. Gora, while speaking with our reporter, yesterday in Abuja, said the need to sustain the enforcement of the device has become necessary, as some motorists have devised ways of disconnecting it from their vehicles. He said the essence of introducing the speed device for motorists was to curtail cases of road crashes on the highways. He said the sector had arrested some motorists that disconnected the device from their vehicles. “Besides, we have entered the ember months, and the basic thing we are doing is to remind the motorists that they must drive carefully and observe traffic rules and regulations,” he said. The sector commander further said the corps would clear obstructions caused by double parking  of articulated trucks at Gada-Biyu, Kwaita, Yangoji, SDP Junction in Gwagwalada and Tungan- Maje in Zuba on the Abuja-Lokoja road. He said he has visited all the spots to see the obstructions, adding that the sector was liaising with executives of the truck drivers’ union in the exercise. “We are also working with the Federal Ministry of Works to get a temporary location that these trucks will park, for the drivers to eat or do whatever they want to do within the environment and later proceed, “ he added.
