The leader of a major spiritual organisation, Brotherhood of the Cross and Star, His Holiness Olumba Olumba Obu, has advised Nigeria to return to the 12 states structure and its former national anthem. He said the country witnessed tremendous growth, peace and unity when that structure and anthem prevailed, adding that God was much in love with them. Olumba, who has frequently emphasised on these two items, said without them peace, unity and progress may still be illusive. “Nigeria should return to the former 12 states structure if they want peace, greater unity and progress. The former national anthem emphasised much on peace and unity amongst the peoples of different ethnic groups,” he said. The religious leader also called for greater caution against wanton killing of Nigerians and recklessness and urged the country to seek for peace.
