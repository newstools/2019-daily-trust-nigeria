A Non-Governmental Organisation, Social Integrity Network (SINET) said yesterday that Nigeria has lost one million tons of steel manufacturing products and about 30,000 jobs between 2017 and now to smuggling activities and importation of substandard steel products. The NGO said as the Federal Government revives the Ajaokuta Steel company, President Muhammadu Buhari should urgently device effective policy to curb smuggling in the steel sector. According to the group, if the massive economic losses occasioned by smuggling were not halted, there might be no future for the nation’s Iron and Steel sector. The National Coordinator of the group, Mallam Ibrahim Isah in a statement yesterday also tasked the President to look into “high conspiracy and connivance among Customs Officer and perpetrators of illegal acts.” He said the President must issue an Executive Order compelling the Comptroller-General to fish out corrupt officers who have been assisting importers to clear good thereby hindering the age-long fight against insurgency, kidnapping and other social vices. He also appealed to the federal government to enact a strong national policy which will further protect the economic interest of the local manufacturers. ‘1m tons per annum steel firms shut down in  Nigeria’ MAN raises alarm over looming job losses due to non-patronage Smuggling: 'Nigeria's economy on verge of collapse' OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
