Chief Whip of the Senate, Orji Uzor Kalu has said that he is not losing a sleep over the judgement of the election petition tribunal, saying if election is conducted 20 times, he would win. The National/State Assembly Petitions Tribunal had ordered for a supplementary poll in some parts of the Abia North Senatorial District where Kalu represents. Kalu spoke when stalwarts of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abia State led by the state chairman, Donatus Nwankpa, paid him a solidarity visit in Abuja. The former governor described as “fundamental error”, the judgement of the tribunal that a supplementary election be conducted in part of the senatorial district.
