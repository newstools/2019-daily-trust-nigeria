The Presidential Support Committee (PSC) has said that  the pace at which President Muhammadu Buhari hit the ground running in the first 100 days of his second term in office was an indication of his determination to take the country to the next level by leaving Nigerians with a lasting legacy. The committee said that the president has set a clear policy direction for his administration, making his second 100 days in office better than his first 100 days in terms of cabinet constitution. In a statement by its Director of Communication and Strategic Planning, the PSC scored President Buhari high, saying the next level agenda was already manifesting, with the speed at which the new cabinet was constituted. Ibrahim stated that the Buhari administration was determined to complete ongoing projects in the first half of his administration, just as he cited the multi-billion dollars Mambilla Hydro Power project in Taraba, which the People’s Republic of China said it will ensure speedy completion.
