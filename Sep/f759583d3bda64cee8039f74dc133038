Governorship candidate of Social Democratic Party (SDP) for the November 16th election Natasha Hadiza Akpoti has said it is time to pull Kogi State out of abject poverty. Akpoti, who said this yesterday in Lokoja when stakeholders of the party paid her a visit on how to oust the incumbent and the ruling All Progressives Party (APC) from the state, pointed out that the misrule of the APC has brought untold hardship to the people of the state. Akpoti said now is the time for all patriotic citizens of the state to join hands to end the ongoing suffering and hardship in the state. “There is no better time than now for all to join hands in pulling out the state from this untold hardship that Governor Bello has subjected our people to. This present government lacks human feeling; they don’t respect the people,” she said. Natasha promised to run an all-inclusive government with every part of the state having a sense of belonging if elected as governor of the state.
