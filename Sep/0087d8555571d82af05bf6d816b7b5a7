A magistrate court in Osogbo, Osun State, has remanded a 70-year-old man, Sunday Oyedeji, in police custody for allegedly giving the police false information. The septuagenarian was arraigned in court yesterday for allegedly telling the police that one Alhaji Sikiru Morenikeji had kidnapped his son, Ayo. The police said Oyedeji knew the information he was giving was false. Police prosecutor, Inspector Lamidi Rasak, told the court that the man committed the offence last year April in Osogbo. Rasak explained that Oyedeji was then released on bail and asked to report again at the police station, but refused to do so. Instead, the defendant allegedly began threatening Morenikeji’s life. The prosecutor told the court that Oyedeji’s conduct constituted a breach of the peace, and had to be re-arrested. Counsel to the accused person, Mr S. O. Popoola, prayed the court to grant his client bail in the most liberal terms. The magistrate, Risikat Olayemi, remanded Oyedeji in police custody and adjourned the case till September 27, 2019.
