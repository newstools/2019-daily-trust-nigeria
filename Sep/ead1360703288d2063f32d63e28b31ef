National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Comrade Adams Oshiomhole has said that the party paid a huge price for lack of cohesion among stakeholders in the Rivers State chapter. Oshiomhole stated this, yesterday in Abuja, while inaugurating a five-member executive caretaker committee for the Rivers State chapter of the party. He said APC could not have failed to produce an elected representative right from councilor to federal lawmakers if it had managed its internal wrangling in the state. He said the caretaker committee was expected to supervise the congresses to produce a new set of party officials for the state. Oshiomhole advised the committee not to toe the path that made APC suffer setbacks in the state. He said the National Working Committee (NWC) was not only ready to send a high-level mediation team to ensure that the congresses were “peaceful, transparent a and family affair” but also willing to swiftly address their concerns. Responding, chairman of the caretaker committee, Isaac Abott Ogbobula, thanked the national leadership for giving them the responsibility to run the affairs of the party and conduct congresses in Rivers.
