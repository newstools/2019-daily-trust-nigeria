The Seaport Terminal Operators Association of Nigeria (STOAN) has said that the Lagos Port Complex, Apapa and the Tin Can Island Port Complex are not congested, and that they are operating at less than 70 percent capacity. It said that this was contrary to the widely held notion that both ports are congested and that there was a need to decongest the ports to make way for fresh cargoes. In a statement it issued in Lagos, STOAN said rather, the major challenges facing the ports are the poor access roads, which have become severely dilapidated. STOAN’s spokesman, Bolaji Akinola, who issued the statement, said, “It is important to correct the understanding of the public about the ports. The hinterland infrastructure leading to the ports in Lagos, namely the roads, are at breaking points. The ports are not congested and are not at breaking points. “Most of the terminals in the two ports are operating below capacity. The busiest terminals are operating at less than 70% at the yard and 60% at berth. So there is no port congestion anywhere as of today.” ‘Restriction of trucks might affect port operation, fuel inflation’ "Ship by pallet" policy to cost Nigeria cargoes Dangote, Flour Mills, others own 50% of trucks in Apapa - STOAN OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
