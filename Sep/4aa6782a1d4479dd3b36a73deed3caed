The Lagos State government is set to unlock 60 identified major highway junctions and corridors critically affecting the free flow of traffic within the Lagos metropolis. The Commissioner for Transportation, Dr Frederic Oladeinde, who disclosed this at the weekend during his project assessment visit to the Oyingbo, Ebute-Meta bus terminal corridor, stated that the traffic challenges, “which vary from junctions to corridors”, were compounded by unregulated roadside trading, indiscipline of motorists and illegal parking. Revealing the locations of the 60 traffic gridlock areas identified across the state, the Commissioner said various strategies would be adopted to clear the logjam, hence the validation exercise preceding the junctions’ improvement works, planning and resolutions.

Oladeinde said that the facilities needed for the water, rail and road multimodal transport plan of the state government were already on ground at Oyingbo for the implementation of the present administration’s seamless transportation policy along the corridor. Decrying trading activities on major roads, Oladeinde reiterated the state government’s commitment to bringing sanity to the market environment across the state and solicited for the cooperation of market leaders and traders in the area, urging them to desist from roadside trading in order to avoid sanctions.
