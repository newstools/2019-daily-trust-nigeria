The International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC), Nigerian Red Cross in collaboration with the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has sensitized private sector organizations on the importance of scaling up their participation and engagement in the humanitarian space. The President of LCCI, Mr. Babatunde Paul Ruwase, who spoke at the sensitization session on humanitarian partnerships and social investment in Africa organised by LCCI in collaboration with ICRC, expressed the interest of the chamber to contribute and support social investments tailored towards addressing humanitarian challenges through partnerships that promote a win-win proposition. “As a country, we have continued to experience humanitarian challenges, especially in the North-Eastern part of the country.  There are also pockets of problems in other parts of the country as well in the North-Central and South-South geo-political zones. According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), the total number of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) as at December 31st, 2018 stood at 2.2 million.” “Between January and December 2018, new displacements resulting from disasters were 613,000 while new displacements arising from conflicts were 541,000. Unfortunately, only 311,000 IDPs are reported to have made partial progress towards a durable solution to their challenges,” he said. He described the event as a further effort at sensitizing and deepening the private sector’s involvement in humanitarian partnerships to engender social investment in Nigeria and Africa; noting that, humanitarian partnerships are meant to enhance the effectiveness of humanitarian action, acknowledge diversity as an asset and ensure transparency.
