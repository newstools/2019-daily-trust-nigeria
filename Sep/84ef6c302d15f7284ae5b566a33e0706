Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, yesterday, disclosed that not less than 1000 traders, marketers and artisans will benefit from a N1 billion soft loan to boost their businesses under the Kwara State Social Investment Programme (KWASSIP) under consideration by the state House of Assembly. The governor made the disclosure at the maiden breakfast meeting with journalists in Ilorin, the state capital, where he reiterated that the focus of his administration will centre around human capital and infrastructural development which would attract investments, combat poverty and take Kwara to the top of the table of revenue generation and competitiveness. He listed his major landmarks to include fixing the perennial water crisis within Ilorin metropolis, taking Kwara out of its pariah status as the least performing state in the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) ranking, getting contractors back to work to complete abandoned or uncompleted projects, paying counterpart funds that have changed the story of the state in health and education sectors, paying years of arrears owed Colleges of Education, and reaccreditation of the state’s tertiary institutions, among others. AbdulRazaq said his administration has done these without touching the N4.8bn it inherited from the previous government, adding that the fund was reserved to kick start the state’s social security programme and putting basic infrastructure in place. Modelled after the Federal Government’s social investment programmes, the KWSSIP would comprise Kwara State Conditional Cash Transfer (KWCCIT) to support those within the lowest poverty bracket by improving nutrition and increasing household consumption; Kwara State Poverty Reduction Programme (KWSPRP) to assist Kwarans to acquire and develop lifelong skills; Kwara State Government Entrepreneur and Empowerment Programme (KWSGEEP) which shall lend money to petty traders, artisans, farmers, enterprising youths, men and women; and the HomeGrown School Feeding Programme (HGSF). ‘Poor power supply turned us to Okada riders’ My closeness with grassroots will make me succeed as governor - Hassan Kwarans are bedridden with poverty - UDP governorship candidate OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
