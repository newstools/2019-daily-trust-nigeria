The governor of Plateau State, Simon Bako Lalong, has warned politicians to stop invading his home or office to lobby for appointments. Lalong, who spoke yesterday in Jos, while swearing in the Secretary to the State Government, Prof Danladi Atu and the Chief of Staff, Noel Dongjur, at the New Government House, Little Rayfield in Jos, said the list of commissioners had since been compiled and would soon be sent to the State House of Assembly. “Don’t send traditional or religious leaders to me. I want to work with those that I know personally and I have compiled the list of my cabinet and ready to send it to the House of Assembly,” he said.

Poor performance, dereliction of duty, nonchalant attitude or outright sabotage will not be tolerated,” he said. He, however, expressed confidence that the appointees would bring their wealth of knowledge and vast experience to the running of government activities and programmes, and urging them to ensure that discipline was maintained.
