The Edo State Election Petition Tribunal, yesterday, dismissed the petition filed by the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Afebu Aigbonaga, against the election of Seidu Oshiomhole of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as the winner of Etsako West constituency II poll to the state House of Assembly. Aigbonaga had filed petitions at the tribunal challenging the declaration of Oshiomhole as winner of the election by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The tribunal, in its ruling delivered by Justice S. M. Kibo, held that the petitioner did not prove the case beyond reasonable doubt and therefore dismissed the petition for lack of merit. …as Adamawa Tribunal affirms La’ori’s election Gombe governorship: APC, candidate go to appeal court Akwa Ibom: Tribunal upholds Senator Ekpenyong's victory OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
