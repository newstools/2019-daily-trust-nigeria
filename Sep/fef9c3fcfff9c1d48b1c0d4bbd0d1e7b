The PDP in Akwa Ibom State has condemned the APC over alleged verbal attack on traditional rulers in the state. Reacting to a recent publication where the APC purportedly discredited monarchs in the state for requesting that the party stopped media attacks on Governor Udom Emmanuel, the PDP said traditional rulers ought to be respected. Speaking yesterday in Uyo, State Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Mr Ini Ememobong, said traditional rulers were the custodians of the customs, values and traditions of Akwa Ibom people and should not be insulted. Ememobong  said the traditional fathers gave the advice in good faith to caution the APC against sponsoring media campaigns that were baseless and unsubstantiated against the governor, INEC, and religious leaders. He said the allegations were capable of reducing the intellectual standing of the average Akwa Ibom person in the eyes of rational people.
