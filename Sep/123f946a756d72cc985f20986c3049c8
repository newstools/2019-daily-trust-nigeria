President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday said Nigeria lost an estimated $157.5bn to illicit financial flows between 2003 and 2012. He said this in New York, on the margins of the 74th United Nations General Assembly while quoting from the 2014 Global Financial Integrity Report in his address to the High-Level National Side-Event organised by the African Union Development Agency and New Partnership for Africa’s Development and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. He said such massive loss of assets, resulted in dearth of resources “to fund public services or to alleviate poverty” in the country at the session under the theme, “Promotion of International Cooperation to Combat Illicit Financial Flows and Strengthen Good Practices on Assets Recovery and Return to Foster Sustainable Development.” Buhari, who identified lack of sufficient capital and corruption as impediments to socio-economic development of the continent, said: “This is why, as Africans, we have no choice but to break the back of corruption. That’s why our government has made it a war we intend to win. We’ll give all it takes to ensure there is no hiding place for purveyors of corrupt practices who are truly enemies of the people.”  FG will win war against corruption–Buhari Panel seeks stemming of illicit financial flows in Africa Why looted assets are difficult to recover – EFCC OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
