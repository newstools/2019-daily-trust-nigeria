A former governor of Abia state and Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr Orji Kalu, has cautioned his supporters against making derogatory statement against any member of the three-man tribunal panel which called for supplementary elections in part of his constituency. He spoke against the backdrop of the verdict delivered last week by the tribunal led by Justice Cornelius Akintayo. A statement made available to our correspondent quoted Kalu as speaking when a group of Abuja based professionals of Abia state origin paid him a courtesy visit. The senator said the judiciary must be accorded due respect by Nigerians regardless of party affiliation, adding that the Appellate court would correct what he called undoing of the tribunal in last week’s verdict. According to him, the rule of law must be respected at all times.
