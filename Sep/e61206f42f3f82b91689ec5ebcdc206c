The Managing Director of Heritage Bank, Mr. Ifie Sekibo, has identified poor identity management as the greatest hindrance to boosting access to credit, especially for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria. Mr. Sekibo stated this while speaking as a guest at the Finance Correspondents Association of Nigeria (FICAN) annual conference which held on Saturday in Lagos. Represented by the Divisional Head (Strategy and Business Solutions), Mr. Segun Akanji, Sekibo said the dearth of effective and standard identity management infrastructure made access to credit for SMEs in Nigeria tough as banks only saw unmitigated risks. He said, “I am talking about identity management challenge. That is the biggest collateral to lending, and that is what is missing in this economy. The day banks can verify where you live, everybody will get loan with ease, because you cannot run away.” He further said there was no need for bank customers to provide collateral to a bank if the bank knew where the customer resided. He added that, “But the problem is this, I don’t know where you live. The address of the company is not where you live. And you can wake up in FESTAC today, but tomorrow you move to Ajangbadi or Victoria Island. You don’t have to tell me. And that is a huge problem for banks”. He gave instances about developed economies such as the US where if one changed accommodation, they must notify all relevant institutions that they deal with because of the inherent value in the system.
