The Lagos State governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, yesterday urged Nigerians not to lose hope, saying the country could emerge among the world’s greatest nations. Sanwo-Olu called on citizens to team up with the government to bring about positive changes that would ensure progress and development. At a thanksgiving service to commemorate Nigeria’s 59th Independence Day celebration, held at the Chapel of Christ The Light Church, Alausa, Ikeja, the governor said there is “a strong need for Nigerians to cohabit in love and be extremely tolerant of others to pave way for the peace of God to reign”, which in turn, he said, would ensure the transformation of the country.

The governor assured residents of Lagos that his administration was on course and fully charged to deliver on all the promises made to the people. In his sermon, Pastor John Ekundayo of the Redeemed Christian Church of God Hossanah Parish, Lagos Province 27, said Nigeria was in dire need of followers who would rise up and challenge the old order. He prayed that God would raise restorers who would transform the country.
