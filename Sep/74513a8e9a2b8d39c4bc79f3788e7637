AÂ Coalition of Civil Society Organisations yesterday in Kaduna staged a peaceful protest calling on the federal government to as matter of urgency shut down the Kaduna-Abuja train services over incessant kidnapping being experienced on the road. The Conveyor, Yusuf Amoke while speaking with journalists during the protest said if the train is shut down, those using its services especially, the top security officials and politicians, will be compelled to ply the abandoned Kaduna-Abuja highway with their security details thereby sanitising the road. He lamented that the criminals have graduated from blocking highways to trailing people to their homes and kidnaping them. He further stated that it is worrisome to see top ranking security personnel who are in the best position to fix the insecurity on the road, resorting to using the train service for fear of being victims on the highway.
