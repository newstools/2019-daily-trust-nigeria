 The founder of Kazit Children Development Foundation, Mrs Aramide Togun, has urged teenagers and youths to steer clear of hard drugs and premarital sex. Togun was speaking at a programme organised to enlighten teens on trending issues such as sex and drug abuse held in Abuja on Friday. OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY “I felt there was so much of drug abuse, rape and sexual abuse going on in the society and we need to educate our teens not to engage in them,” she said. One of the lead speakers, Mrs Morounkayo Matilukuro, said parents and care givers should report cases of sexual abuse and that offenders should be punished appropriately. One of the participants, Olayemi Olajigbu, 13, said with what he learnt, nobody would lure him into drugs or casual sexual intercourse. The foundation also gave out 70 school bags and writing materials to three orphanages as part of its Back-to-School Initiative.
