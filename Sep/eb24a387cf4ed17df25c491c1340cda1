An evangelist with the Baptist Convention, Matthew Akor, has launched a book, which according to him, is God’s revelation of Nigeria’s destiny as a country. Akor, who spoke with our reporters at the book launch at the Merit House, Maitama, Abuja, yesterday said it is a  religious book entitled, “Exodus:180 Million Nigerians Marching into a Destined Nation. “It came as an inspiration from God. It’s a fulfillment of Gods mandate to Nigerians,” he said, adding that it was meant to bring the nation closer to God. “Our nation today is characterised by so many atrocities like kidnapping, corruption, killings, amongst other atrocities, so Nigerians need to get close to God,” he said. He said it was difficult, at first, to comprehend the message from God but he persevered and was able to write the book. “For people with similar vision, I advise that they write down the vision, set it straight and God will direct,” he advised. Mr Jimmy Osho Olumi, a classmate of the author, during the book launch  said  “This book launch is predicated on alumni association. It has given us the opportunity to come together as friends once more to harness  ideas that will further  promote the nation. “It’s a spiritual book but highly educative. As Nigerians we are known for religious sentiments, ethnicity and corruption  which are not helping our nation. The essence of the book launch is not only to make the book known to the general public but also to proffer lasting solutions to these issues,” he added.
