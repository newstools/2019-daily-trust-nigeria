Bauchi State government has paid up N15 million as refund to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) for  its Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and other interventions in the state. Governor Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed approved the immediate refund of N15 million to the State UNICEF Field Office during an interactive session with its officials led by the state Chief Field Officer, Mr Bhanu Pathaki. The governor was responding to a request by UNICEF for the state government to refund the money not utilised by the Bauchi State Primary Healthcare Development Agency (BSPHCDA) during the last administration. Senator Mohammed frowned at the spending of N732 million by the previous administration without proper documentation. He said he would continue to ensure  payment of counterpart funding to enable the state access more interventions from donor agencies. Governor Mohammed also promised the readiness of his administration to fill the human capital gap in the state for effective implementation of projects by development partners. Mr Bhanu Pathak said UNICEF supported the implementation of five programmes in health, education, sanitation, nutrition and child protection. According to him, the organization has set aside N270 million for the supply of commodities to treat malnourished children. He, therefore, appealed to the governor to allocate more resources for tackling malnutrition in the state.  1.6 million children,pregnant women to receive‎ free medical care in Bauchi UNICEF establishes additional centres to tackle malnutrition ‘What Bauchi is doing to reduce out-of-school children’ OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY
