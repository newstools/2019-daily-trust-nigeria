The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) loses over N2.1 billion to debtors on outdoor advertisements and signage within the city annually. The director,  Department of Outdoor Advertisement and Signage (DOAS), Dr Babagana Adam, made the disclosure while conducting an enforcement exercise within the nation’s capital on Wednesday in Abuja. He said the department would continue to carry out the enforcement with the aim of achieving the desired goals of making Abuja one of the best cities in the world. Adam said due to lack of response from the practitioners, DOAS called for reconciliation and recovery but that only 24 out of 96 practitioners appeared before the department. He said 70 to 72 per cent of the practitioners were either not functioning or were no longer in the business. He explained that there were no fewer than 147 signages within the FCT that would be pulled down, saying the department had so far removed 18 and was looking at the possibility of getting heavy duty equipment to remove others. He advised owners of malls, hotels, shopping complexes, banks and restaurants to register with DOAS, and pay their bills to avoid sanction. Adam, therefore, solicited the support of media practitioners to educate and enlighten the public on the need to abide by the laid down rules and regulations guiding the department in the FCT.
