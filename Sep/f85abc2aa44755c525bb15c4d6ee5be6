The Nigeria LNG Limited (NLNG) has made a significant step towards the Final Investment Decision (FID) for its Train 7 Project, with the issuance of a Letter of Intent for the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) Contract of the project to SCD JV Consortium. SCD JV Consortium is made up of Saipem of Italy, Japan’s Chiyoda and Daewoo of South Korea. This is coming on the heels of the Nigeria Content (NC) plan signed with the Nigerian Content Development Monitoring Board (NCDMB) and   the recent milestone of the 3rd of September, 2019 when NLNG submitted the summary outcome of the commercial bids evaluation for the Train 7 Project to NCDMB in line with the project certification and authorization procedure. The Managing Director of the Nigeria LNG, Mr. Tony Attah, said at the Letter of Intent Signing Ceremony in Abuja that the document was one of the key milestones to be achieved on the road to FID by its Shareholders. The Train 7 Project is expected to ramp up NLNG’s production capacity by 35 per cent from 22 Million Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA) to around 30 MTPA. The Project will form part of the investment of over $10 billion including the upstream scope of the LNG value chain, thereby boosting the much needed Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) profile of Nigeria. The Project is anticipated to create about 10,000 new jobs during the construction stage, and on completion, help to further diversify the revenue portfolio of the Federal Government and increase its tax base. The construction period after FID will last approximately four to five years.
