The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Plateau State have clashed over the delay by Governor Simon Bako Lalong to constitute the State Executive Council (SEC). The state PDP is accusing Governor Lalong and the APC of wasting four years in office. In a statement by the state Publicity Secretary of the PDP, John  Akans, the party said while other governors celebrated their 100 days in office with their complete cabinet in place and some identified projects commissioned, Governor Lalong was still in a state of confusion on how and where to start from. “While other governors  celebrated this occasion with their complete cabinet in place and some identified projects were  commissioned in  commemoration of  this occasion, our own  dear governor, Simon Lalong, is still in a state of confusion on how and where to start from,” he said. But in a swift reaction, the APC said the governor was not in a popularity contest with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) but was on a mission to restore peace, revive the economy and build solid infrastructure. The State APC Chairman, Letep Dabang, said PDP had failed to understand that the 100 days achievement mantra was synonymous with first term governors and not re-elected governors such as Lalong who was more interested in the welfare of his people and has almost completed all the projects the PDP abandoned. He stated also that the governor had simultaneously initiated several legacy projects some of which have been completed with others ongoing.
