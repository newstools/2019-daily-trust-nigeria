Farmers in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have been urged to embrace electronic commerce (e-commerce) to ensure good marketing and profit for their farm produce. The Chief Executive Officer of Lifezgreen Diamond Acres Limited, Tunji Iranseoluwa, made the call at the unveiling of Nigeria’s first agribusiness e-commerce platform in Abuja on Saturday. He said despite the quantities of farm produce in Nigeria, farmers were unable to get appropriate market thereby leading to shortages. He said farmers need to move with the trend and adopt e-commerce in getting suitable markets and patronage for their produce and products.

Look at what is happening in Ghana. Nigeria grows more yam than Ghana so we need a seamless system to make exporting of farm produce work. That is what we are bringing in. “We are going to the e-world whether we like it or not. We need agricultural technology and we must move with the trend. Technology has made everything easier so for the rural people it is just a matter of sensitisation,” he said. He said the group would also collaborate with some local governments in the country to engaging and training farmers, adding that they need not have internet because they tap into e-commerce. “We will partner with the local governments so that even if the farmer in the village cannot access internet, he knows what to do by meeting our agent and selling to them, so that their produce and products could go global,” he said.
