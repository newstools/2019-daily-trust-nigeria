The Fight Against Corruption Advocates (FACA) has urged the Election Petition Tribunal to nullify the 2019 presidential election that returned Muhammadu Buhari as president. A spokesman of the organisation, Prince Azi Olalekun Omololi said, yesterday, in Abuja that their call was premised on the European Union (EU) observers report on the 2019 election which indicted INEC and proved that the commission was not transparent. “Atiku’s evidence at the tribunal clearly confirms that the 2019 presidential poll was rigged and Buhari’s inability to provide his certificate disqualifies him automatically. All these clear corrupt acts by INEC, APC and Buhari are enough for the election to be nullified.

The fight against corruption can be achieved better if our judiciary proves her competence in upholding justice for the Nigerian masses,” Omololi said.
