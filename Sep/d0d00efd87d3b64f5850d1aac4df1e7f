Two agrarian communities, Kwanji and Gebbe, in Yauri  Emirate, Kebbi State, have lamented the absence of roads and markets in their areas. The communities called on Kebbi State government to extend the dividends of democracy to them. The two communities located on the coast of River Niger, while making the appeal, said they were instrumental to the success of the All Progressives Congress( APC)  in both the 2015 and 2019 general elections. According to their Spokesman, Aminu Muhamed Gebbe, the communities, comprising more than 50 villages, produce significant percentage of the cash crops in the emirate. He said: “Kebbi State Government may wish to note that our people are predominantly farmers,  whose major pre-occupation is to produce food and cash crops for survival of people of the state. But this is often with stiff difficulties because of the absence of road networks to access markets”. He urged the state government to extend the construction of Kaoje-Lafagu road to Mayal-Sargu-Dorayi-Gurwo-Inugu-Jargaba-Kawara down to Gebbe and Kalkami-Bukunji-Tsamiya to terminate at Fasatullu. “This will will translate into economic prosperity for our communities in particular and Kebbi State in general.’’ Aminu saiddevelopment of the state could only be realized when farmers could readily access market to sell their products. “We want this not to be viewed as demanding for too much considering the strategic importance of these communities in the state economy and politics, more so, in the spirit of fairness and equity which Kebbi State represents,’’ he said.  20 years of North-West state called Kebbi Food security: No concrete arrangement in Sokoto, kebbi, Zamfara How far can Atiku Bagudu go in Kebbi?
