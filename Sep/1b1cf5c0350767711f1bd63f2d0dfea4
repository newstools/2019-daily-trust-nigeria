The police on Thursday, arraigned a 37-year-old welder, Oji Yaro, in a Karmo Grade 1 Area Court, Abuja, over allegedly absconding with N172, 000, belonging to his customer. Yaro, who works at Daki Biyu village, Jabi, Abuja, is charged with two counts of criminal breach of trust and cheating. The prosecution counsel, Mrs Ijeoma Ukagha, told the court that the matter was reported by the complainant, George Okoh ofÂ  Holy Family Catholic Church, Life Camp Abuja, at the Life Camp Police Station on Sept. 6. Ukagha alleged that sometime in July, the complainant gave Yaro N172, 000 to construct handrails for his stairways but that he absconded with the money. The prosecutor further told the court that the defendant could not provide satisfactory account of himself during police interrogation. She said the offence contravened the provisions of sections 312 and 322 of the Penal Code. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges.
