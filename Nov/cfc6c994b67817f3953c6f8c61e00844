The Halima Initiative for Women Development (HIWD), an NGO, has donated learning materials to over 1000 school children in Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) Camp at Durumi in the FCT. The News Agency of Nigeria  reports that the learning materials comprised of exercise books, school bags, mathematical sets and some edibles. Distributing the items at the FCT IDPs Camp on Sunday, HIWD Chief Executive, Hajiya Halima Bello, said the NGO realized that children in the camp lacked adequate learning materials while many packed their books to school in plastic bags. Bello said she felt fulfilled that she was able to contribute her quota to the children’s development as part of her goal to touch lives. Bello noted that there was the need for collective action from all Nigerians to contribute to the improvement of lives of displaced persons in the country, saying government alone could not do it. Speaking during the event, Ms. Adaobi Uyanwune, a Volunteer from the Initiative for Food Environment and Health Society, expressed optimism that other stakeholders would do more in touching lives of disadvantaged persons in the country. Liyatu Ayuba, Woman Leader from Gwoza, Borno State, also expressed joy at the support from the NGO, urging relevant authorities to show a little more concern about the welfare and survival of IDPs. She said that government alone could not adequately meet the needs of over 3,000 IDPs in the FCT Camp and commended  religious groups for their support and skills acquisition training. Ayuba called for the construction of perimeter fences to ward off intruders from the camp following reports of attempts of kidnappings on the facility. NAN reports that the IDPs Camp at Durumi in FCT, with a population of 3,000, was established in 2014 following the impact of insurgency in the North East. (NAN)
