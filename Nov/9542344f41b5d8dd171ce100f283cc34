As part of efforts to further grow the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) business in the country, the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Mallam Mele Kyari, has said that the Final Investment Decision (FID) for NLNG Train 7 would be executed next month. Mallam Kyari made this disclosure Thursday in Abuja while receiving the Chairman and Group Chief Executive Officer, Total Group, Patrick Jean Pouyanné and other top management of the Group. A statement by NNPC acting spokesman Mr. Samson Makoji said the GMD stated that the corporation would continue to align its business processes with its partners in accordance with global best practices for the benefit of the investments and for the good of Nigerians who, he noted, remained the key shareholders of the National Oil Company. “We see Total Exploration and Production as a total partner. Total is one of the few multinational oil companies in Nigeria that are fully integrated with their visible footprints from the Upstream to the Downstream Oil and Gas Sector,” Mallam Kyari said. Earlier, the Chairman and Group Chief Executive Officer, Total Group, Pouyanné, said Nigeria was very important to the Total Group, saying that its Egina project was currently producing 200,000 barrels per day. He reassured that the Total Group would continue to invest in more deep-water projects in Nigeria and described the NLNG project as a very important asset that his company was deeply committed to.
