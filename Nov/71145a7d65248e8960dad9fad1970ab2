The Court of Appeal in Sokoto has dismissed the appeal filed against the election of Senator Ibrahim Gobir (APC, Sokoto East) by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Salihu Maidaji. Maidaji had filed the appeal against the judgement of the election petitions tribunal that dismissed his petition and upheld Gobir’s election. The tribunal had held that the petition was filed out of time, and dismissed it for being statute-barred. Delivering judgment, Justice Hamman Akawu Barka, said the tribunal was right to have dismissed the petition for being statute-barred. He therefore dismissed the appeal for want of merit. Meanwhile, in separate judgements involving four Federal Constituencies, the Court of Appeal upheld the elections of three APC and one PDP House of Representatives members. Those of the APC were Abdullahi Salame representing Gwadabawa/Illela Federal Constituency; Architect Aliyu Almustapha (Rabah/Wurno) and Abubakar Umar Yabo/Shagari Federal Constituency. The Court of Appeal also upheld the election of PDP’s Mani Maishinko Katami represeting Binji/Silame Federal Constituency.
