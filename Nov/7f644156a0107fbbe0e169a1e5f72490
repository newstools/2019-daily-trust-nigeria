There was gridlock along the Airport Road, Abuja yesterday morning following the visit of President Muhammadu Buhari to the National Judicial Institute, Abuja. The gridlock stretched from Lubge to Alieta up to the NJI Junction as a large detachment of security men with their patrol vehicles were seen stationed at strategic places along the Airport Road. Motorists coming from both lanes were stopped by the security agents for nearly  20 minutes, which resulted in the gridlock. City News observed as some motorists and passengers alighted from the vehicles, murmuring over the gridlock. A motorist, Segun Ajibade, said it was unfair for the security men to block the two lanes since the president was only going to the NJI. “One expected that since the president is going to the NJI, they would have paved way for vehicles coming to the city, instead of causing unnecessary traffic jam this morning,” he said. Reacting, the FCT police commissioner, Bala Ciroma, who spoke with our reporter via telephone said the blockade of the road was as a result of the president’s movement. “The president was actually going to the NJI, which was why we deployed our men at strategic places along the Airport Road,” he said.
