The Court of Appeal sitting in Kaduna has nullified the election of the member representing Tudunwada/Doguwa Federal constituency, Alhassan Ado Doguwa, over irregularities. It could be recalled that the National Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal sitting in Kano had upheld the victory of Doguwa, who is the majority leader of the House of Representatives. Doguwa was challenged before the tribunal by the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Air Commodore Salisu Shehu (rtd) with allegations of over-voting and other electoral malpractices. However, delivering judgement yesterday, Justice Oludotun Adefope-Okojie ordered the Independent National Election Commission (INEC) to conduct fresh election in the entire constituency within 90 days. Setting aside the tribunal judgement, the court nullified the entire election in the two local government areas which Doguwa represents, saying the whole process was marred by irregularities. The appellate court held that the entire election could not stand as INEC had omitted other parties from the final declaration of the result.
