Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), the umbrella organisation of political parties in Katsina, has berated Governor Aminu Bello Masari, for allegedly abandoning them after winning election with their support. Speaking at the end of their meeting in Katsina at the weekend, the state chairman of IPAC, Musa Usman, said lack of recognition by the Aminu Masari-led administration was demeaning and uncalled for, adding that IPAC played an important role in ensuring the victory of APC in the state. According to him, of the 18 political parties that took part in the election processes of 2019, 12 withdrew their candidature and supported Aminu Masari to become governor. “But what is befalling us in terms of neglect and non-recognition is worrying. Masari has listening ears and is ready to correct things but his subordinates are the worse off who keep blocking his well-intended mission towards IPAC. “IPAC in Katsina has mended its fences and speaks now with one voice. We have closed ranks and are working for the advancement of Katsina State,” he added. When contacted, the Director General, Media and Publicity to the governor, Abdul Labaran Malumfashi queried: “He has abandoned them in what way, have they made any move or request that has not been approved by the government or governor? “I do not think so, because, everybody knows who Governor Masari is and what he is capable of doing and not doing; but what he is capable of not doing is certainly abandoning people who especially have an agreement or understanding with.” Why I joined APC — Sen Ida Why I joined APC — Sen Ida Why I joined APC — Sen Ida Prostate  ENLARGEMENT?
