Kano State Governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, has said that running the affairs of government will no longer be business as usual. Ganduje was quoted to have spoken during the maiden State Executive Council meeting in a statement by the commissioner of Information, Malam Muhammad Garba. He said the focus of his administration would be centred on human capital development which would be carried out under three defined sectors of education, health and economic empowerment. To this end, the governor charged the newly appointed commissioners to sit up and face the task of consolidating and building on the achievements so far recorded by the administration. He charged the commissioners to take full charge of the ministries assigned to them and parastatals under them for effective service delivery. The governor also tasked the commissioners to use their experience in bringing about the desired changes through the initiation of people-oriented projects and programmes in all sectors of development.
