Mother of former President Goodluck Jonathan, Mrs Ayi Jonathan, yesterday in Otuoke, Bayelsa State, prayed for the success of the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state, Chief David Lyon. She prayed for Lyon’s success in the November 16 poll when she received him during an unscheduled visit to her as part of his campaign tour to the area. Lyon, during the courtesy visit, promised to tackle the myriad of challenges confronting Bayelsa State if elected governor. Addressing a mammoth crowd of his supporters in Otuoke, Lyon criticised the abandonment of the water project in Ogbia local government and promised to ensure the reactivation of the project if elected governor. He also promised to bring the Imirigi gas turbine back to life for the state to have uninterrupted supply of electricity. “They have kept you poor and have concluded that you can be easily bought during election. If they give you money, collect it and vote them out. When I become governor, I will ensure judicious use of the state’s resources and optimum development of Bayelsa State,” he said. Immediate past chairman of Bayelsa State Environmental Authority under Dickson’s administration, Mr Robert Enogha, who recently resigned and decamped to APC, called on the people of Ayama community and the entire Ogbia, to vote for the APC candidate.
