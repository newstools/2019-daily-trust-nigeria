The House of Representatives yesterday said it would investigate alleged corruption in N-power scheme of the Federal Government. A member, Oluga Taiwo, in a motion, urged the house to investigate what he called arbitrariness and possible corruption in the scheme. “In Osun State alone, over 400 N-power beneficiaries/teachers are being owed monthly allowances ranging from 12 months, 15 months and 18 months respectively due to arbitrary withholding of their account and unlawful exit from the platform despite diligence at the place of official assignment,” he alleged. The house directed its Committees on Sustainable Development Goals and Youth Development to investigate the allegations and report in three weeks. ‘N/Assembly can summon oil minister without presidential consent’ N-Power:  Drama in Ekiti as pro-Buhari, Fayose factions hold rallies N90bn allegation: I’ll waive immunity to  clear my name - Osinbajo Kindly take one minute (1) of your time to fill out this short question.
