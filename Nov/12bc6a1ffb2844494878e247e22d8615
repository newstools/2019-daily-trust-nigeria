The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has faulted the 50 years development plan being conceived by Governor Willie Obiano of Anambra State. PDP, in a statement signed by its state publicity secretary, Nnamdi Nwangwu, expressed worry over the intention of the government in inaugurating a 51-member committee for the project given the governor’s antecedents over the years. Recall that the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) government in Anambra State had few days ago inaugurated a committee headed by a former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Professor Chukwuma Soludo, to put to paper a 50-year development plan for the state. According to Nwangwu, PDP saw nothing wrong in planning, both short and long term, but he was very worried about the intention of the planner given, what he called, the antecedents of the governor. “The fact that the very bogus committee of 51 persons is headed by Prof Chukwuma Soludo, who is widely believed to be Obiano’s anointed and preferred aspirant to emerge as the candidate of his APGA in the 2021 gubernatorial race in the state, completely gave the intention away. “A deeper look at the antecedents of Obiano gives the whole plot away as another form of jamboree and showmanship aimed at hoodwinking the people further.
