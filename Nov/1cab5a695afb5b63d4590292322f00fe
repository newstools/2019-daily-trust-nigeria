A shareholder and Chairman of the Abuja Electricity Distribution (AEDC), Ambassador Shehu Malami has said it was his goodwill that paved way for the acquisition of the DisCo during the 2013 privatisation. In a statement yesterday, Malami who was reacting to reports about AEDC shareholders’ disputes dismissed claims that KANN Utility Company Limited, the shareholders’ firm was selling its 60% equity stake in the DisCo due to constant shareholders’ squabbles. For AEDC, Federal Government owns 40%, while KANN owns 60% (Xerxes and CECA). “The 60% is jointly owned by Xerxes Nigeria Ltd and CEC Africa on 50-50 basis (or in effect 30% & 30%). This is the true position with Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) as at today,” Malami said. On its co-shareholder, CEC Africa (CECA) paying $81 million equity and raising another $123m loan security to acquire AEDC, Malami said: “The truth of the matter is that it was the goodwill of the Chairman of AEDC, HRH Amb. Alh. Shehu Malami that actually paved way for CECA and Xerxes through KANN as a special vehicle to even have access as well as win the bid.” He dismissed the 75% ownership of the DisCo’s equity by CECA, which secured the UBA loan. It also said CECA misrepresented that it injected funds into KANN as investment. “The reality is that the fund was indeed a loan to KANN which is to be repaid by the company.” Malami noted that the Nigerian shareholders have rejected the forceful takeover of AEDC by CECA with plans to amend the Articles of Association of KANN to his company, Xerxes. Malami however, confirmed crisis at AEDC over refusal of the Board of Directors at its recent meeting to renew the tenure of its Managing Director as they comply with the local content regulation of the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC). “This they (CECA) have equally made every effort to resist unsuccessfully,” it noted.
