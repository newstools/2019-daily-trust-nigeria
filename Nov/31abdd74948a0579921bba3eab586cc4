The Lagos Environmental Sanitation Corps (LAGESC) is set to commence Operation Zero Tolerance on street trading and hawking across the state. To this end, the corps is interfacing with appropriate stakeholders before massive enforcement and implementation. The LAGESC Corps Marshal, retired Commissioner of Police, Gbemisola Akinpelu, on Tuesday took his advocacy campaigns to the President-General, Association of Commodity Women and Men of Nigeria, Mrs Folashade Tinubu-Ojo. Saying at the meeting that the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration was resolved to ensuring a greener and cleaner environment, Mrs Akinpelu added, “It is, therefore, important to seek the support of your association and members to key into this vision toward ensuring adequate synergy to completely eradicate street trading, hawking, indiscriminate dumping of refuse and other environmental nuisance in Lagos State as they relate to our market places.” She decried the traders’ activities, which included displaying goods on road setbacks and walkways and hawking on the roads, noting that the activities impeded free flow of traffic and contributed to littering the streets with dirt.
