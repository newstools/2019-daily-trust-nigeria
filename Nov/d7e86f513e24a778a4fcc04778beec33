Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) and the Federal Ministry of Justice have established a Special Investigation and Prosecution Task Force on Electricity Offenders (SIPTEO) to prosecute all electricity offenders in the franchise area. A statement by its spokesman, Ibrahim Sani Shawai said the management was alerting members of the public who are still in the business of vandalism, energy theft and meter by-pass and other unlawful acts to desist from such acts as there now exists a proper legal framework to deal with them. He said members of the taskforce had a special training to handle issues relating to power sector sabotage of any kind. The DisCo also urged customers with outstanding bills to clear them as the law also covers that aspect because the money received is what the company uses to reinforce efficient and effective power distribution service to its numerous customers. Commenting, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Dr Jamilu Isyaku Gwamna said: “We collaborate to set up this task force in order to protect our customers. Like I always say, all we do is in the interest of our customers and that’s our watchword on which KEDCO is built. “We cannot allow a few to dislocate the satisfaction of the majority,” he noted.
