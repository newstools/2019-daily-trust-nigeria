The FCT ministerial taskforce team on free flow of traffic yesterday went round some parts of the city to monitor the level of compliance by tricycle operators to the restriction. The chairman of the taskforce team, Mr. Ikharo Attah, who led other members of the team, to AYA area of Asokoro, said he was satisfied with the level of compliance by the operators. He said the operators have demonstrated their patriotism by obeying the rules and directive of the FCT administration. He, however, called on the aggrieved tricycle operators to key into the government’s transportation policies, even as he said that the enforcement team of the DRTS impounded 32 rickety taxis in the territory. He noted that the more compliance was required to make the policy successful for the benefit of all, saying the palliative measure government was putting in place will cushion the effect of the policy implementation. According to him, the restriction policy was aimed at sanitizing the city’s transportation system and making Abuja conform to the mega city dream of the founding fathers. He maintained that no group would be allowed to abuse Abuja’s master plan, even as he assured that relevant security agencies were collaborating to ensure the sustainability of the policy. “And apart from the areas around the Garki model market where very few tricycle operators were sighted just around dawn, the compliance level as at this morning is laudable, ” he said.
