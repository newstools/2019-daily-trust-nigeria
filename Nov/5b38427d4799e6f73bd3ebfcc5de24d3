A member of the National Caucus of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Sam Nkire, says the party will be difficult to dethrone come 2023. Chief Nkire, who spoke after the APC National Caucus meeting in Abuja, said those who thought that President Muhammadu Buhari’s exit from power in 2023 would cause the party to disintegrate were in for a huge “democratic disappointment”. He said the APC had not only come to stay but was poised to meet the needs and aspirations of the good people of Nigeria under the leadership of President Buhari. “Muhammadu Buhari is going nowhere. He remains leader, member, vote mobilizer and APC’s talisman even after he exits the presidency in 2023,” he said. The APC chieftain, who spoke on the various criticisms and divergent views trailing the achievements and leadership style of the ruling party, said people in opposition were entitled to their opinions. The Abia State-born political leader said the APC would not be distracted from its set goal of service to the people. He said the recent electoral conquests of the party in Bayelsa and Kogi states showed that Nigerians were appreciative of the fact that President Buhari was on course to right the wrongs he inherited from the PDP administration.
