Justice Mohammed Liman of the Federal High Court, Lagos, has adjourned the trial of a Lagos-based businessman, Kenneth Ndubuisi Amadi, and his company, Idid Nigeria Limited, till January 8, 2019. Amadi and Idid Nigeria Limited were alleged to have obtained N1.115 million by false pretence from a petroleum company. The accused businessman and his company were alleged to have committed offences contrary to section 1(1)(a) of the Advance Fee Fraud and other fraud related offences Act, Cap A6, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004 and punishable under section 1(3) of the same Act. When the matter was called on Thursday for the defendants to be arraigned, they were not present in court. The chief state counsel from the Department of Public Prosecution of the Federation, Mr. A. K. Alilu, told the court that it had been difficult to serve the defendants a copy of the charge. However, the counsel to the defendants, Barrister Emeka Etiaba, told the court that he and his clients were not opposing arraignment and trial and that he had spoken to the prosecutor to avail him a copy of the charge on behalf of the defendants. The prosecutor thereafter served Etiaba a copy of the charge. Justice Liman then adjourned the case for arraignment.
