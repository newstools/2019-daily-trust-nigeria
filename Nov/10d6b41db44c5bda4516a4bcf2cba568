The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, has announced a donation of N20 million for the building of the Throneroom Parish, which currently holds Service at the Transcorp Hilton, Abuja. Adeboye made the donation during Sunday service at the parish yesterday in Abuja, declaring that the Throneroom will be a miracle centre where the barren would get the fruit of the womb and those who are stagnated in life would get accelerated promotion. He said the parish was a beautiful church with beautiful people, saying God has inspired him to ask the congregation how many of them would invite him for lunch. “Since I cannot follow all of you to the restaurant or to your homes, you can give me the lunch right here,” he declared. The General Overseer added that the lunch members of the congregation would offer him in cash will be used to buy the land to build the parish, which he chose to visit and worship at among over 100 churches of the RCCG in Abuja. He prophesized that when he would visit the parish again next year, the church would have been built. The Pastor in Charge of Throneroom Parish, Tunde Benjamins, in an interview with journalists, after the church service which lasted for two hours, said the visit by the general overseer was a divine  and he believed would bring many blessings to the parish. He urged Nigerians not to despair as Pastor Adeboye has brought a message of hope to the capital city.
