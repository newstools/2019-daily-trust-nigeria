Normal legislative activities have resumed at the Bayelsa State House of Assembly after the impeachment saga that rocked the law-making body. Recall that the crisis rocking the assembly peaked on September 30 following moves to sack the then speaker, Tonye Emmanuel Isenah, for Monday Obolo to takeover. The crisis, which resulted in the assembly having two persons laying claim to the position of speaker, obstructed the normal working of the house for some time. Since the governor and some PDP stakeholders in the state waded into the crisis, which later led to the house withdrawing the impeachment of Isenah and his subsequent resignation few weeks ago, the new speaker, Monday Obolo, has been running the affairs of the assembly peacefully. The first major assignment of the Obolo-led assembly was the screening and confirmation of chairmen and members of the 32 rural development areas of the state, who were sworn in by Governor Seriake Dickson a few days later. Penultimate Monday, during plenary presided over by Obolo, the house deliberated on the Bayelsa State Oil Producing Area Development Bill, which later scaled through second reading on the floor of the state assembly. The bill has since been committed to the House Committee on Mineral Resources to report back in four days. Our correspondent reports that this week, the parliament has not held plenary as the lawmakers were busy with the governorship poll in the state.
