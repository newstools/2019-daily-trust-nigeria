The Commandant General of an NGO, Neighbourhood Enlightenment and Safety Organisation (NESO), Sani Aliyu, has urged the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) to work with the anti-insurgency group in checkmating the activities of kidnappers in the territory. Aliyu, who spoke during a capacity building workshop on new perspectives in intelligence, counter-insurgency and forensics organised by the organisation for its senior staff in collaboration with the International Institute of Certified Forensic Investigation Professionals, USA, in Suleja, said a robust partnership with the FCTA would end kidnapping in the territory. Aliyu said, “The cases of kidnapping in the FCT are true; that is why a robust partnership is very important. We have more than 1,000 members in the FCT, and in my own modest way, I have tried to reach the government. We know we can provide safety in the FCT, and we have been doing so.” He said members of the organisation had a high success rate in stemming insurgency and terrorism because they were unknown to the people. He added that, “We are operating under the shadow, if the FCTA finds it worthy to partner with us, I will assure you no single case of kidnapping would be heard in the FCT.” He commended the activities of the security in fighting terrorism in the country, but expressed displeasure that the effort of the organisation had not been well recognised. Aliyu further said, “We get saddened when we hear security agencies being described as ‘not performing’. We want to give them the necessary support so that they will succeed in their constitutional mandate. We are passionate about them and they are not about us. Some of the training we are doing could have been organised by the security agencies.”
