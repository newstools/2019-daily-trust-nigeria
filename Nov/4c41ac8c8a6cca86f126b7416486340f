The new Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, yesterday advised criminal gangs in the state to relocate or be made to face the music. Odumosu said that his mission in the state was to reduce the crime level extensively. Odumosu, who officially took over yesterday as the new Lagos CP from Zubairu Muazu, who is now an Assistant Inspector-General of Police, also vowed to keep men and officers of the Command on their toes. “I want to assure members of the public of my commitment in the fight against crime in Lagos State. I am a believer of community policing. We will involve the citizens in the war against crime through community policing. “Because I am here to fight crime, I can’t be awake while my officers are sleeping. I have been in Lagos and have the wealth of experience and residual knowledge to attack crime,” he said. Muazu urged all policemen in the state to give Odumosu maximum cooperation as they did to him. “The fight against crime is not the CP’s business alone. The war is for everybody. You supported me and I want you to do the same thing to my successor. One of the major challenges still confronting the command is the issue of cultism. I want you to tackle it headlong,” he said.
