The Lagos State Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Tunji Bello, has ordered all street traders, commercial drivers and squatters to vacate the outer Marina area. He also threatened to prosecute whoever fails to adhere to the directive while disclosing plans by the state government to commence work on the beautification and landscaping of the area. The commissioner said in a statement that operatives of the State Task Force on Environmental and Special Offences Unit would from next week move to the area to enforce the law. He urged all commercial vehicle operators in the area to move to the designated parks, warning them against picking passengers along the road. He also urged pedestrians to use the overhead bridge, saying defaulters would be arrested. “The State Task Force on Environment will soon move to Ikoyi and Victoria Island to clean up the area by ridding it of all environmental nuisances, hawkers and street traders among others,” he said.
