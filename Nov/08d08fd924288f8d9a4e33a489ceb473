Twenty-four hours after the Court of Appeal sitting in Ibadan affirmed the victory of Oyo State Governor Engineer Seyi Makinde at the March 29, 2019 governorship election, thousands of supporters yesterday stormed the Oyo State Secretariat, Agodi, Ibadan, in solidarity with the governor. The coalition of Non-Governmental Groups (NGOs) including the Save Oyo; Oyo Mandate Group; Mekunnu Koya; Oyo Dotun; Women Voice and Oyo State Youth Grand Alliance, at the rally, told Governor Makinde that the people were solidly behind him. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr Taiwo Adisa, said the leaders of the peaceful protest displayed placards which praised the service delivery agenda of the Makinde administration. While addressing the crowd, the governor restated his commitment to serving the people of the state, noting that nothing could happen to the mandate the people gave him on March 9, 2019. The governor added that ever since he was elected by popular votes, he had been serving the people, promising not to relent in providing them the dividends of democracy.
