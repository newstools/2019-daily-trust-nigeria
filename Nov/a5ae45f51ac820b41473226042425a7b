The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has counselled the leadership of the Senate to resist any form of intimidation from the Presidency to surrender its independence and pass bills and requests without statutory legislative scrutiny and oversight. The partyâ€™s position was predicated on the blanket comment credited to the Senate President, Senator Ahmed Lawan, that any request from President Muhammadu Buhari to the National Assembly is good for the nation, even without subjecting such request to statutory legislative scrutiny. The PDP, in a statement yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, described the comment as unconstitutional and unacceptable as it was capable of relinquishing statutory powers of checks and balances of the National Assembly. PDP said the comment also gave an impression that the present National Assembly has been annexed by the executive and reduced to a rubber stamp legislature.
