Director General of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) Salihu Lukman has called on the National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, to redeem his image by freeing himself from those egging him on to take controversial actions. Salihu, who made the appeal yesterday while addressing journalists in Abuja, said he had no regret either for advising Oshiomhole to convene a meeting of the APC National Executive Committee (NEC) to address challenges facing the party or resign. He said the call on the party national chairman to convene a NEC meeting was inspired by his pledge to ensure that all organs of the party meet regularly in his May 10, 2018 speech. He wondered how President Muhammadu Buhariâ€™s call on governors to help institutionalise the party could be achieved when the leadership did not follow the rules. Salihu said the APC might lose the coming 2020 poll in Edo State after what he called a celebration of fight during the governorship primary election if a NEC meeting was not convened to tackle the looming danger. He noted that the National Working Committee (NWC) meeting held on Wednesday which should have spoken on the candidacy challenge in Bayelsa, instead busied itself endorsing the suspension of the state party chairman in Edo State.
