The PDP has asked the INEC to act “quickly” on the Abuja High Court ruling disqualifying the deputy governorship candidate of the APC, Bishop Degi, by invoking the relevant sections of the constitution and the Electoral Act. The PDP in a statement last night by its, National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, said that a gubernatorial candidate without a deputy cannot stand on one leg and walk into election and should be quickly disqualified as well.  Secondus, who spoke through his Special Adviser on Media, Ike Abonyi, said the court ruling meant that the APC had no validly nominated candidate for the November 16 governorship election.
