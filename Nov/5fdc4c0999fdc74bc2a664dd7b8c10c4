The House of Representatives has passed for third reading Presidential Transition Bill which seeks to ensure a smooth transition of power between incoming and outgoing administration in the country. The Bill, which was sponsored by Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila, sought “to make provision for the smooth and orderly transfer of power from one government to another. The Bill has a ‘Criminal Liability’ Clause which provides that, “Any person who violates any provision of this Bill by failing to provide the necessary facilities required to be provided under this Bill or fails to provide any required documents thereby frustrating the efforts of the transition team shall upon conviction be liable to a fine of N10 million or a term of imprisonment of not less than 6 months or to both fine and imprisonment as the case may be.” Breaking: Jonathan signs pension reform bill The Hate Speech bill The New Pension Reform Law
