An Ado-Ekiti chief magistrate court has sentenced a 21-year-old man, Musa Bala, to a year in prison for stealing four phones. The police prosecutor, Inspector Caleb Leranmo, told the court that Bala stole the phones valued at N200,000, property of Ojo Oluwasegun, on November 17, 2019 in Ado-Ekiti. Giving the details, Leranmo said Bala and his friend went to the complainantâ€™s house and stole the items while Oluwasegun and his family members were sleeping. The prosecutor said the convict was arrested by neighbours who later handed him over to the police, while his accomplice escaped. Bala pleaded guilty to the charge against him and the chief magistrate, Mr Abdulhamid Lawal, sentenced him to jail, but gave him a N25,000 option of fine.
