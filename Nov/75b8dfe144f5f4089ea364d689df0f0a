The Resource Centre for Human Rights and Civic Education (CHRICED) has called for the involvement of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to save the electorate and election officials from the brigandage of politicians and others political actors in the country. The Executive Director of CHRICED, Dr  Ibrahim M. Zikirullahi, made the call on Monday in Abuja at a news conference. He said he was making the call on the heels of the pockets of violence and other forms of electoral malpractices recorded in the November 16 governorship and other by-elections in Bayelsa and Kogi states. “Bayelsa and Kogi states elections have come and gone but leaving behind a trail of sorrow, tears and blood. For us at CHRICED, we cannot consider the shows in the two states as democratic elections because both failed to meet the minimum standards for free, fair and credible polls that are universally recognised for election to be accepted. “CHRICED calls on stakeholders to consider steps to invoke the ICC’s principle of the right to protect to save innocent voters in Nigeria from the hands of politicians arming thugs to win elections,” Zikirullahi said.
