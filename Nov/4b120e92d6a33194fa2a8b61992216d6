The two brothers who were abducted by gunmen suspected to be kidnappers in Gwagwalada last week have regained freedom after a ransom of N1.5 million was paid to the kidnappers. City News reported that the brothers, Alhaji Mohammed Mishebwa and Alhaji Yunusa Mishebwa, who are natives of Dobi Community, were abducted by gunmen last Wednesday night while returning from their farms on a motorcycle around Kwalita Village in Gwagwalada Area Council. A member of the victims’ family who preferred  anonymity confirmed the release of his brothers via telephone yesterday. He said the victims were set free at 07:45am last Friday after the kinappers collected N1.5m from the family. He said the brothers were released on their farms after the family pleaded with the kidnappers to accept N1.5m instead of the N10m they had demanded. He, therefore, called on government to take decisive action against the rampant  cases of kidnapping in the FCT, especially in rural communities, which he said had affected farming activities. Efforts to confirm the development  proved abortive as the spokesman of the FCT Police Command, ASP Maryam Yusuf, did not pick calls put across to her as at the time of filing this report and did not also reply to a text message sent to her.
