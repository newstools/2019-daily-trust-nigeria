 The only way the crisis rocking the APC in Rivers State can be addressed is for the leaders of the party to engage all the feuding camps, Senator Magnus Abe has said APC in the state has been enmeshed in crisis following the differences between Abe and Amaechi over who flies the party’s governorship ticket in the 2019 governorship election in the state. Senator Abe, who spoke at a press briefing in Port Harcourt, said the crisis in APC in Rivers has its root in the unconstitutional decisions of Amaechi to summarily expel and exclude him and other leaders of the party who, he said, are sympathetic to his 2019 governorship ambition. Abbe, who represented Rivers Southeast in last Senate, alleged that Amaechi announced at the party’s stakeholders meeting that every member of the party that was sympathetic to him should leave the party, claiming that the minister boasted that he was ready to destroy the party to expunge those sympathetic to him in APC. He advised the party’s leaders to convene a meeting and draw a roadmap for the amicable resolution of the crisis in it.
