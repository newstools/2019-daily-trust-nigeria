Indigenous energy group Aiteo has alertedon the rising spate of attacks on key national oil infrastructure, the Nembe Creek Trunk Line (NCTL), one of the major crude oil transportation channels used for export. The NCTL operated by Aiteo, which is 100 kilometres long and has a capacity of 150,000 barrels per day at Nembe Creek, evacuates crude to the Bonny Crude Oil Terminal. The company’s Head of Media Operations Ndiana Matthew in a statement yesterday, said despite significant investments in security, technology and civic engagements, the destructive pattern of pipeline vandalism still persists. He said the disruptions that these attacks have brought about has led to direct, irretrievable and significant losses in production and consequently has created revenue deficits that directly impact all the stakeholders across the relevant value chain. He said: “It is a matter of utter dejection and frustration to note that in 2019 alone…the breaches to the NCTL have revealed that 98% of all incidences were attributable to third-party infractions alone! The amount of barrels lost to these incidents, almost compare in volume to the country’s total daily production. By virtue of this level of sabotage, the NCTL has been shut down for 61 days this year alone, constituting 83% cause of downtime in this year only. Over the last 4 years, more than 200 shut down days have been recorded on the asset.” He said the company remained totally committed to working with all agencies and interest groups to arrest this damaging atrocity.
