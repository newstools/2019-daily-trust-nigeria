The former Commissioner of Police in Lagos State, Imohimi Edgal, yesterday assumed duty as the new helmsman at the Ogun State police command. Edgal replaced Bashir Makama, who was in charge of the Ogun command for barely seven months. The former Lagos CP arrived the Ogun State police headquarters, Eleweran, Abeokuta, at 11am, inspected the guard of honour and officially assumed duty. A statement by the Command’s spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said Edgal was received by members of the state police management team led by the Deputy Commissioner of Police in-charge of Operation, Edward  Ajogun. Oyeyemi said the new Commissioner had directed all policemen serving in the state to return to their duty posts from wherever they maybe “as there is going to be a physical head count of all the personnel attached to the Command.” He also ordered the cancellation of all forms of leave, except in emergencies, saying all hands must be on deck to checkmate the activities of hoodlums, especially during the ember months and yuletide season.
