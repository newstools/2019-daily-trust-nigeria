Youths in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have been urged to go through the proper channel, if indeed they must migrate from Nigeria. Founder of Mothers Earth International Foundation, Hafsatu Yusuf, made the call while addressing journalists in Abuja yesterday. She said many youths have died while others were abused and molested by traffickers in their bid to leave the country. “A significant number of Nigerians in their thousands may have gone out of the country, in an attempt to get a better life but several times, it  turns out to be a bitter life, as many get caught up with traffickers. This is too rampant in what is now referred to as the triangle of shame,” she said. She said most people have been brainwashed into believing that they could sell their possessions and give the money to traffickers to get away from the country. She told the youths that instead of risking their lives, they should contact the migration office of the Nigerian Immigration Service or search on the internet on the proper means and channels of getting into their choice countries. Hafsatu said the group has concluded that during its conference on women migration to be held in 2020, it would engage youths and sensitise them on the need to desist from irregular migration. She advised governments to have a displacement tracking system and also rejig their social intervention programme to cover the most vulnerable people in the society.
