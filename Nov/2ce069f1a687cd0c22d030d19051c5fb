A 23-year-old bus conductor, Tunji Oluyera, cried like a baby inside the dock yesterday when a magistrate court in Osogbo, Osun State, sentenced him to three months imprisonment for stealing a phone. The prosecutor, Bose Shoyemi, told the court that on October 12, 2019, at 2pm around Dada Estate in Osogbo, Oluyera entered the shop of one Akani Akeem under the pretence that he wanted to buy table water from him. Shoyemi stated that while the shop owner was in the process of selling the table water to him, the accused person stole his phone, valued at N42,000. The accused person pleaded guilty and begged for mercy. His counsel, Okobe Najite, pleaded with the magistrate to mitigate the punishment for his client, saying he was a first time offender. Magistrate Risikat Olayemi sentenced Oluyera to three months imprisonment, with a fine option of N10,000.
