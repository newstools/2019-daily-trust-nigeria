The All Progressives Congress (APC) says it has uncovered an alleged plot by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) led government in Bayelsa State to lure voters with N20,000 each, deploy fake police and military uniforms and clone Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) among others to rig the governorship election. APC Deputy National Publicity Secretary Mr Yekini Nabena, in a statement issued yesterday in Abuja, also claimed that Governor Seriake Dickson recently ordered the secret release of 100 inmates awaiting trial from Okaka Prisons in the state capital, Yenagoa, to work for the PDP during Saturday’s governorship election. Nabena said apart from the intelligence report gathered, some members of the inner circle of Governor Dickson’s camp had also volunteered some information on how PDP was planning to rig Saturday’s governorship election. The Bayelsa-born politician, who specifically drew the attention of security agencies to some of the revelations, also urged them to prevent the PDP from carrying out the plans which he described as “evil against the people of Bayelsa”.
