An Igando customary court has dissolved the marriage of a 67-year-old man, Aliu Kareem, to his wife, Khadijat, over change of attitude by the woman and threat to the man’s life. Kareem, a resident of No. 7, Steven Igbasan Street, off Egan Isuti Road, Lagos, told the court that Khadijat started misbehaving when he retired. The petitioner said, “When I was working, she was taking good care of me. Immediately I retired, she no longer cared for me and on one occasion, she instigated one of our children to beat me up because of petrol. Before I retired, I opened three shops for her. All the money I invested in the business is now her own. I spent all I had on her and her children. But today, I am suffering. “She comes in and goes out anytime she likes. There was a day she wanted to take the vehicle out and I told her not to, but she went to buy a chain and locked me inside the house. “I don’t love her anymore. For the past seven years we have not been sleeping together. I want the court to dissolve our marriage and I want the court to order her to give me my landed property and the N300,000 I invested in her business.” Khadijat denied most of Kareem’s allegations, saying, “I always come back early. It was only one day that I locked him in. I have never instigated the children to disrespect him. I did not collect any money from him and the shop receipt was in my name, he only added more to my capital.” The court president, Barrister Koledoye Festus Adeniyi, dissolved the marriage and ordered the respondent to return all the petitioner’s documents to him.
