The Adamawa state Head of Service, Dr Edgar Amos, on Wednesday said the state government would pay a new N32, 000 minimum wage to its workers at the end of November. Amos said the state government would pay N32,000, which was more than the N30,000 approved by the federal government, in fulfillment of Governor Ahmadu Fintiri’s campaign promise to pay N32,000 minimum wage if elected. “The national minimum wage is N30,000 but the governor is going to pay N32,000 because that is his promise,” Amos said. The head of service, however, said that the issue of consequential adjustment for other workers earning above the minimum wage was still being discussed with labour unions.(NAN) National minimum wage: Adamawa teachers expect N32,000 Adamawa PDP governorship candidate promises N32,000 Minimum Wage Buhari: I’m committed to new minimum wage Prostate  ENLARGEMENT?
