The Chairman, National Governing Council (NGC) of the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) Nigeria, Senator Abba Ali, said Nigeria’s economy will gain with the upcoming second African Peer review mechanism. Senator Ali said this weekend in Abuja at the quarterly meeting of the council. A statement said the 15-man NGC’s meeting was to deliberate on programmes of the self-assessment exercise that will be conducted by APRM Nigeria. The Council, whose members were appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari, was inaugurated in July 2019 to oversee implementation of the Nation’s Second Peer Review process. Senator Ali said by the time the report is out, there will be lasting solutions to socio-economic challenges like insecurity, unemployment, food security, gender- inequalities among others. “We are confident that our recommendations will be embraced by the entire continent to address some of those challenges in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2030 of the  United Nations (UN) and African Union’s Agenda 2063”, the Chairman said. The National Coordinator, African Union Development Agency, Princess Gloria Akobundu, said, “It is part of the efforts to help President Muhammadu Buhari to deliver on his mandates.” Edozie Madu, a Council member of APRM Nigeria said, “Proper implementation and coordination will greatly help to ensure the Council to synergise and galvanize given mandates.” Nigeria begins APRM/NEPAD mandates review for economy, good governance Nigeria undergoes 2nd peer review Nigeria’s 2nd APRM: Conversations in the North East Prostate  ENLARGEMENT?
