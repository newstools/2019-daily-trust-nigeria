The Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association (NECA) has called on the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to closely monitor the directive of 65% loan to deposit to banks to prevent derailment. Mr. Timothy Olawale, Director-General of NECA made the call at the weekend in Lagos. Recall that on July 4, 2019, CBN directed commercial banks to maintain a minimum Loan Deposit Ratio (LDR) of 60% aimed at aiding the growth of the real sector of the economy. Olawale said: “We are concerned that these unorthodox methods being deployed to achieve this aim may have many unintended negative effects if effective monitoring mechanism is not put in place.” Expressing concern at the level of interest rate, Olawale said high interest rate, at double digit hinders access to credit. “With the volatility of the Nigerian economy and the unpredictable regulatory environment, the risk of a double digit interest rate could be too high for businesses, especially the Small and Medium Enterprises that are supposed to also be beneficiaries of the directive,” Olawale said. The DG urged CBN to do more than give directives by ensuring their effective implementation and monitoring. He said more deliberate efforts should be made to ensure a hospitable business environment that will make lending attractive and borrowing by the real sector even more attractive.
