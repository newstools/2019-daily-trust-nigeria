Butchers in Kubwa town of Abuja, yesterday embarked on strike, accusing authorities of denying them a space in the  new modern market, set for commissioning. Many residents who went to the Kubwa abattoir, which is now used for both slaughtering and meat selling, were turned back as the facility was under lock and key. Speaking to our reporter, leader of Kubwa butchers, Alhaji Umar Sule Kabo, said all butchers in the town have resolved to go on with the strike from yesterday (Monday) pending when their demand of providing them space is attended to. “At the present new market, about 25 persons among our members have completed payment for stalls meant for our business, while many others are in the process. But we are yet to be given any space up till now,” he said. Also speaking, Abubakar Galadima, one of the butchers’ leaders, said apart from the protest which he described as an indefinite one, they wil also make efforts to meet the officials at the FCDA to see how the issue will be resolved. Meanwhile, efforts to speak with the Bwari area council chairman John Gabaya, over the matter was not successful, as he did not pick calls put through to his mobile phone or reply to a text message sent to him.
