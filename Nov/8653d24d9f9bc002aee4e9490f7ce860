An Abuja-based non-governmental organisation, The Pause Old People’s Home, has carried out free medical outreach and exercise for the elderly in Abuja. Founder of the Home, Barr. Hauwa Umar Jibrin, noted with dismay that Nigeria, with a great proportion of the aged population, and many retired senior citizens has no articulated  national policy to cater for their healthcare and general well-being. She therefore, said her foundation has initiated moves to lobby members of the National Assembly to make laws for the protection and welfare of the elderly people in Nigeria. “We are already lobbying the  lawmakers to get favourable legislation for the protection of the aged. We are also working to get government’s attention to the plights of the aged people in our society. “We are already working on getting the government to formulate policies that will protect the interest of the old people. We want to amplify their voices, since not many of them can come out to speak concerning their needs”, she said. Also speaking, Acting Secretary,  FCT Social Development Secretariat (SDS), Hajia Safiya Umar, stated that she represented FCT Minister of State,  Dr. Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu, who was already considering a special programme for the aged within the territory. The Secretary noted that beside efforts by the FCT administration to domesticate some international treaties for the protection of elderly people,  it was advocating policy formulation and budgetary provisions that will cover healthcare for elderly people from the age of 60 free.
