The governorship candidate of United Peoples Congress (UPC) in Saturday’s election in Kogi State, Dr Sunday Abu, has denied stepping down for Governor Yahaya Bello. Abu said the claim by the state’s party chairman, Moses Damisa, that the UPC had collapsed its structure into that of the APC and Governor Bello was a figment of his imagination. “The decision of  Moses Damisa is a figment of his imagination and has no bearing with the party’s national, state  leadership and members. “I therefore implore all our members to disregard the purported statement of the state chairman of the UPC, that our great party has collapsed its structure to APC in the next governorship election in the state. “We are in the race to occupy Lugard House, and God willing, we will be there. Our esteemed members are advised to troop out en masse and vote for Dr Sunday Abuh, the candidate of UPC,” the statement said.
