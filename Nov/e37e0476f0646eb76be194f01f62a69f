The Minister of Power, Engr. Saleh Mamman on Thursday said power supply has improved all over the country as power generation increased to over 7,500 megawatts (MW) while power transmission rose to 7,000MW. Engr. Mamman disclosed this at the commissioning of the 47.5 kilowatts (KW) solar power system at the Doka Rural Hospital in Kaduna. “I will not fail to inform this gathering that our grid power generation capacity today is over 7,500MW, the transmission capacity has also improved to 7,000MW. This development is responsible for the improvement in power supply that is witnessed by customers all over the country recently.” Governor El-rufai said the poor power supply experience especially in hospitals with risks to mother and baby, and using candle light for delivery led to the solar system initiative. El-rufai who was represented by the Deputy Governor, Dr. Hadiza Balarabe said, “By improving power supply, we can help reduce the risk of loss of lives.” The State is funding the solar projects across the 34 PHCs starting with the commissioned project at Doka to provide sustained access to electricity for the PHCs that has served 155,000 residents. She said with the additional 10m Euros from the EU and State Government’s $8m commitment, the projects under Kaduna Power supply company (KAPSCO), will be extended to all rural hospitals and other 221 PHCs to supply 3.69 megawatts (MW) of electricity.
