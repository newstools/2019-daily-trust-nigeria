The Sokoto State Government has set up an Intra-Ministerial Committee to reconcile the state government’s debt to Kaduna Electric. The State’s Commissioner for Energy, Alhaji Aliyu Balarabe stated this in Kaduna recently when he paid a visit to the Head Office of the DisCo. He said that the state government is concerned about the state of electricity supply in the state and has commenced mobilization and sensitization of the citizens on the importance of payment of electricity bills and protection of supply asset against vandalism. “The state government is currently wooing investors to the state and in a not-too distance future, a consortium of Moroccan investors are going to set-up a fertilizer company in the state. I am in Kaduna Electric to discuss all electricity issues in Sokoto State and further cement the relationship between the State Government and Kaduna Electric”, he said. In his response, the Managing Director/CEO of Kaduna Electric, Engr. Garba Haruna assured the commissioner of the company’s unwavering commitment to support the industrial drive of the Sokoto state government. He directed the Chief Engineering and Technical Services Officer to immediately constitute a working group to study all issues raised and come-up with innovative solutions. Haruna, who said only one third of energy supplied to the state is being paid for by electricity users, called on the state government and other consumers to leverage on the opportunity provided by the Meter Asset Providers (MAP) Regulation to get metered.
