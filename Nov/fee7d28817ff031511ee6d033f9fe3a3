A statement issued by the Deputy Director, Public Communication of the PDP campaign council in the state, Austin Okai urged the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC and security agencies to address the situation. “Financial inducement and food items are being exchanged for Permanent Voters Card of unenlightened electorates and those traumatised by poverty occasioned by the maladministration of Alhaji Yahaya Bello. INEC should put machinery in motion by rolling out awareness programmes to enlighten the public of the implications of selling their PVC for 5,000 or more in the state,” he said.
