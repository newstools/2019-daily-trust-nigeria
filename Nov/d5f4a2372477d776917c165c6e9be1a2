The Deputy Speaker of Gombe State House of Assembly, Shuaibu Adamu Haruna (Kwami East), has been impeached. He was removed, yesterday and replaced with Siddi Buba (Kwami West) during a plenary presided over by the Speaker, Abubakar Sadiq Kurba (Yamaltu West). The member representing Yamaltu East, Adamu Saleh Pata, moved the motion for the impeachment and was seconded by Tulfukut Meme Kardi (Billiri East). Daily Trust gathered that all the 21 members present during the sitting signed a list for the impeachment and voted unanimously when the speaker moved the motion. Shortly after the impeachment, Mohammed Abubakar from Akko nominated Siddi Buba, who is from the same Kwami LGA as the former deputy speaker, to serve as the deputy speaker. Mustapha Usman Hassan (Gombe South) seconded the nomination of Siddi Buba and was unanimously supported by the House. Our correspondent reports that only Ali Baba Manu (Gombe North) was absent during yesterdayâ€™s sitting. The clerk of the assembly, Barr. Rukayya Jalo, said in such circumstances, Section 94 of the Nigerian 1999 Constitution as amended, permitted the House to immediately swear-in a newly elected Deputy Speaker. The House later adjourned its sitting to November 19, 2019.
