The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, has called on APC stakeholders in Kebbi State to make the party an all-inclusive entity in order to strengthen it beyond the 2023 general elections. Malami made the call days after President Muhammadu Buhari charged party stakeholders in states to strengthen the APC in order for it to outlive his tenure. While speaking at the stakeholders meeting, which had in attendance the governor, his deputy, three senators, eight House of Representatives members, local government chairmen and party leaders, Malami said every member must be given equal opportunity if the party must be strengthened and well positioned beyond 2023. He called on the leadership and members of the party to remain committed to its successes for the good and progress of the state and its people. Gov. Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, in his speech, said there was need to reconcile aggrieved members of the party who lost out in the just concluded local government elections in the state.
