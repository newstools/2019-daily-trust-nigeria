The APC chapter chairmen in Yobe and Kogi States have denied asking the party’s National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, to resign. In separate statements issued yesterday, the Yobe APC chairman, Adamu Achilare, and his counterpart from Kogi, Abdulahi Bello said they were not in support of the group that met in Abuja after the APC National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting to demand for Oshiomhole’s resignation. Achilare wondered why the group would include him and forge his signature without consent, adding that he has nothing against Oshiomhole. The Kogi state chairman of APC, who also distanced himself from the meeting and its resolutions, said he would not hesitate to take legal action against the masterminds of the purported list. Chairman of the Forum of APC state chairmen, Bukar Dalori, had earlier issued a statement insisting that the forum never met to demand for Oshiomhole’s resignation.
