The  ruling APC in Kano State has slammed the opposition PDP over a false alarm raised in a statement alleging plan to influence the choice of Court of Appeal judges who will seat on the Kano governorship election appeal. It said the allegation made against the APC and its candidate, Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, was not only a move to blackmail the Appeal Court but also an indication that the opposition party was jittery, confused and afraid of possible loss at the court. A statement signed by the commissioner for Information, Malam Muhammad Garba, stated that it was the discretion of the court to decide who presided over its proceedings.
