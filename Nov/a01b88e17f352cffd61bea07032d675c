If people can move from Point A to Point B, they can transport their children to school, can move their products and produce to markets and go to work on good roads, they will happy.” Speaking earlier, the Chairman of North West Oil and leader of the team, Mrs. Winifred Akpani, called on the governor to ensure the deregulation of the oil sector as the masses did not benefit from subsidy.
