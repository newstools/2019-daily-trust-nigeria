The Zamfara State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Abuja, on Monday dismissed a petition challenging the election of Governor Bello Matawalle of the state. The petition, filed by Muhammed Sani Takori of Advanced People’s Democratic Alliance (APDA), also joined the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as respondents. Takori and APDA in the petition prayed the tribunal to nullify the emergence of Matawalle as governor, alleging that he did not score two-thirds of the votes cast in the local government areas of the state as required by law. They also declared that substantial votes cast on the election day as waste. Delivering judgment on the petition yesterday, the tribunal headed by Justice Binta Fatima Zubair held that the petition was un-meritorious in view of the Supreme Court pronouncement of May 24, 2019. The apex court had in the judgment delivered by the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) Tanko Muhammad, held that votes cast for candidates who ought not to have participated in an election are wasted votes that cannot be used in determining outcome of an election. Justice Zubair held that by implication, the votes cast for Governor Matawalle and his party, the PDP, were the lawful votes as far as the March 9, governorship election in Zamfara State was concerned.
