Policemen attached to the Satellite Town police station, Lagos, said they arrested the suspects, Ismaila Amadi and Bashiru Useni, at the weekend, following information from some members of the public on the gang. The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, who confirmed the arrest, said the suspects pushed a lady into a dark corner of the expressway at the Alakija bus stop area, and while one of them sexually assaulted her, the other snatched her bag.
