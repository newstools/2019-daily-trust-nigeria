A non-governmental organization (NGO), Israel Ibeleme Foundation, has commissioned two classroom blocks it renovated at Junior Secondary School (JSS) Gosa, in Abuja. Speaking during the commissioning at the weekend, the Convener of the foundation, Mr Israel Ibeleme, said the commissioning was unique to him because it was the first time the foundation would be commissioning classrooms in Abuja. He therefore called on well-to-do Nigerians and other NGOs to assist the less privileged in the society, saying one must not be rich before giving back to the society. The principal of the school, Mr Achi Michael, commended the good gesture of the foundation, while urging other organizations to emulate it. He said stakeholders need to imbibe the culture of giving to the society, no matter how small. He said he met the classrooms in dilapidated state when he was transferred to the school a few years ago. “The ceiling, the floor and the walls were all in a sorry state and the convener of the foundation assured us that he will renovate the classrooms and he kept to his word,” he said.
