A police detective attached to the Lagos zonal office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Idris Musa, yesterday told the Ikeja Special Offences Court how an accused person, Aina Olajuwon, allegedly defrauded a White man of $400. Musa, a witness who identified Olajuwon in court, said there was an intelligence report that led to the arrest of 12 men, including the defendant.  It was alleged that the suspect engaged in internet fraud, popularly known as yahoo yahoo, at Ijedodo Ijegun, Lagos, on August 29, 2019. The witness said items recovered from the men included laptops and an iphone 7, which were allegedly being used for internet fraud. He said, “after their arrest, we took them to the office for more investigation. The defendant told me that he is into internet fraud and had received $400 from a victim called Maxwell Kennard. He said he has a phone on which he has created three email accounts, using the names; Jessica conbard234@gmail.com, awsome123@gmail.com and one other.” Musa further said that the defendant told him that he had also been chatting with a woman with intent to obtain money from her. “A document was opened on his laptop, which contained chats with the victim, with photographs,  which was printed out from his email. The document was shown to him and he confirmed it to be the document he used. “The document contains false information. After that, he endorsed on each printed page, wrote his name, signed and dated it. There was also another photograph of a lady’s sanitary pad containing blood. He said the victim was suffering from menstrual pain and bleeding,” he said. Justice Sherifat Solebo adjourned the case till January 16, 2020 for further hearing.
