* says Ortom didn’t win that election The candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the last gubernatorial election in Benue state, Barr. Emmanuel Jime, on Thursday said he has accepted the outcome of the Appellate Court in good faith. But Jime, in a statement by his spokesman, Kula Tersoo, in Makurdi insisted that Ortom did not win the 2019 gubernatorial election in Benue. “Today too, we receive the Court of Appeal judgement in good faith, but remain resolute in our contention that, by the majority of lawful votes cast, Samuel Ortom did not win that election,” he stated. The APC gubernatorial candidate added that, “I will meet with our team of lawyers and together we shall carefully study this judgement and decide on the next line of action.” Jime therefore urged his supporters, party faithfuls and others he described as the true advocates of genuine change to remain calm and await his next decision.
