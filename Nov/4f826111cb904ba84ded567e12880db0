The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has issued a stern caution to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) over what it described as fictitious votes being bandied from Okene and other areas to allegedly favour the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). The party, in a statement yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, specifically demanded the cancellation of the alleged allocated results, particularly in Okene Local Government Area. The party maintained that it would not accept “provocative alteration” of results from polling units and particularly the alleged allocation of 112,000 votes to the APC in Okene. The PDP claimed that the people of Kogi State had glaring evidence of alterations of figures to reduce the vote of the PDP and allocate imported figures to APC, adding that INEC shouldn’t declare such results. “The party therefore cautions INEC not to ever declare such mutilated results as they will not be accepted by the people. “Our party hopes that this apparent move to allocate fictitious results to the APC has no bearing with the allegations in the public space that Governor Yahaya Bello and the APC had compromised highly placed INEC officials with huge sums of money to alter result in favour of the APC,” the party said. #KogiDecides: PDP demands cancellation of results in Okene LG #KogiDecides: APC forcing INEC, NYSC officials to sign pre-filled result sheets in Kogi —  PDP #KogiDecides: APC's Bello records massive victory in Okene Prostate  ENLARGEMENT?
