A former Commissioner of Police, Alhaji Abubakar Tsav, has advocated for the amendment of the electoral law to deepen democracy in the country. Tsav, who spoke in Makurdi against the burning to death of the woman leader of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kogi State, said the killing must be probed and the perpetrators must be punished. “It is the most horrible thing I have heard within recent times. I am happy that President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered a thorough investigation of that dastardly act with a view to bringing all those involved, no matter their status, to justice. “President Buhari should go beyond that. The electoral law should be amended for true democracy to take root,” he said. The ex-police commissioner added that his sad experiences during his days in the Nigeria Police Force, where when a government was interested in a case such cases did not see the light of the day, should not be allowed to happen in the present case involving the murdered woman leader. Our politicians don’t believe in God-Tsav Tsav must prove his allegations against me in court – Ortom We need President with military background  - Tsav
