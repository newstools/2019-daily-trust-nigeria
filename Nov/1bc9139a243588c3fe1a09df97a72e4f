Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State yesterday asked the Allied Peoples Movement (APM) gubernatorial candidate in the March 9 election, Adekunle Akinlade and other opponents to join hands with him to move the state forward. This followed the Court of Appeal judgement which on Monday validated Abiodun’s victory as winner of the last gubernatorial poll in the state. Akinlade and his party had approached the Court of Appeal, Ibadan Division, seeking to upturn of the tribunal judgment which in September upheld the governor’s election. Speaking yesterday when he received in his office some executive members of the State APC, on congratulatory visit, Abiodun said it was time “for all to work together for the progress of the state.” A statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin, quoted the governor to have said his administration’s doors were open to those who wished to join hands with him to move the state forward.
