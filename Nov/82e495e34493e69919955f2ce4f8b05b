The Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN) has called on Nigerians to take advantage of the National Housing Fund (NHF) scheme to own houses by registering and contributing 2.5percent of their monthly income. The bank which has joined other corporate organisations both local and international to showcase its products at the ongoing 33rd edition of Lagos International Trade Fair has a primary mandate of financing affordable housing for the low and middle income earners in both the formal and informal sectors through the NHF Scheme. According to the Managing Director/Chief Executive of the Bank, Arc. Ahmed Dangiwa, the overall objective is to provide cheap source of loanable funds to nurture and sustain the mortgage industry and eventually facilitate affordable home-ownership for the low and medium income group in the country. To increase more participation of Nigerians to theÂ  scheme, he noted that the bank has scrapped equity contribution for houses costing not more than N5m, while loan request above N5m but not more than N15m attracts 10percent equity. Also, to enhance operational processes, the bank, he said has gone digital with the launch of the USSD code *219# platform where contributors can access information to retrieve NHF account number, account balance, generate statement of account and check affordability using the Mortgage calculator among others.
