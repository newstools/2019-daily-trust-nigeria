The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Bankers’ Committee of Nigeria has commemorated the World Savings Day by educating over 80,809 students in 642 schools on savings culture. Themed “Savings Give Life a Lift”, the engagement events cut across 565 local governments with information on the importance of building a good savings culture, both for their financial future, as well as encouraging a sense of discipline and planning. Mr. Emeka Emuwa, Chairman, Financial Literacy and Public Enlightenment Sub-Committee (FLPE), said: “Many of these students are our future Bankers and as such we will continue to develop programmes and activities that will further empower them.” Financial inclusion is a constituent pillar of the Bankers’ Committee mandate, making initiatives like this critical to the goal of increasing the number of financially included citizens in the country. The World Savings Day is observed annually to raise awareness on the importance of building a good savings culture.
