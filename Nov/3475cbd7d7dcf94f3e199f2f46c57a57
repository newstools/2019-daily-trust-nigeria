A non-governmental organisation, Eziudo Forum, has urged the various tiers of government in the country to, as matter of urgency, begin the implementation of the Child Rights Act, in order to have positive impact on children. The CEO of Eziudo Forum, Barr. Leonard Onwuzurike, stated this while donating food items to Mother Theresa Children’s Home, located in Gwarinpa, Abuja at the weekend. He said the  visit was a demonstration of the group’s core values of showering love and empowering the less privileged. The group donated several bags of rice, beverages, wheat flour, cartons of noodles etc and undisclosed amount of cash to the children’s home in commemoration of the group’s fourth year anniversary. Onwuzurike, in company of the chairman of the committee, Mr. Lawrence Oji, said it was the desire of the group to take care of disadvantaged children, interact with them and feel their pain. “In line with its policy thrust on empowering the less privileged, the group sensitized the children on appropriate social values,” he said.
