Adah dismissed the appeal filed by the candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Mr. Charles Onyirimba and his counterparts in Action Alliance (AA) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Onyirimba, a US based attorney, had appealed the judgment of the Governorship and National Assembly Election Petition Tribunal, which earlier dismissed the petitions he filed against Uwajumogu’s election.
