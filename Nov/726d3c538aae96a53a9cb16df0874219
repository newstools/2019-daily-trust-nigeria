A 27-year-old man, identified only as Nurudeen was electrocuted while vandalizing a transformer at Anguwar Dawaki in Gwarimpa, Abuja. A witness, Samuel Moses, said the incident happened last Thursday at about 9:48 pm. He said the deceased mounted the transformer, which is opposite The City Polytechnic,Â  allegedly to vandalise some cables when he was electrocuted. He said some passersby who saw the body of the vandal dangling on the transformer on Friday morning alerted the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) who sent their officials to remove the corpse, he said. When contacted, the acting spokesman of the FCT police command, ASP Maryam Yusuf, confirmed the incident, saying that the police condemn such act where some people engage in vandalizing public utilities. She therefore warned those who engage in vandalizing public utility to stay away, saying the command will not rest on its oars in the protection of lives and property.
