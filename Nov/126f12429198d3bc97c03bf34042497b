A former leader of the House of Representatives, Alhassan Ado Doguwa has denied receiving three official cars from the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, after he was sacked from the green chamber by the appeal court. The Court of Appeal had on November 4 nullified Doguwa’s election and ordered for a rerun poll in his Tudunwada/Doguwa Federal Constituency.  An online news platform had quoted Doguwa to have told his constituents during a ‘sympathy visit’ that he had weeks ago received three official cars from the speaker. But in a statement by Hassan Inuwa, Doguwa said his remark during the visit was quoted out of context. “The story did not capture the true context of Hon. Doguwa’s remark. It is on record that no principal officer, serving or non-serving, was allocated any vehicle yet by the House. “Therefore, to say that the former member collected official vehicles during this transition period was out of place, derogatory, and wild machinations from political opponents to smear his name. As a law abiding citizen, Hon. Alhassan would never indulge himself in any action that could undermine the honour and esteem of the House as well as the sanctity of the rule of law,” the statement reads.
