President Muhammadu Buhari has enjoined governors-elect of Bayelsa and Kogi states, David Lyon and Yahaya Bello, respectively to extend hands of fellowship to their main challengers. In separate congratulatory messages to the governors-elect, the president urged them to imbibe the spirit of magnanimity in victory by extending hands of partnership to opposition candidates. He urged those dissatisfied with the outcome of the election to approach the courts. The president, in a statement issued yesterday by his Special Adviser on  Media and Publicity Femi Adesina on Kogi election, described the  election and emergence APC candidate as “a race well run and a victory well won.” The president urged Bello to see his renewed mandate as another opportunity to build on the foundations already laid towards improving the lives of the people. “All political actors and stakeholders must take deliberate steps to eschew electoral violence as a peaceful and orderly process is vital to our quest for enduring democracy,” he said.
