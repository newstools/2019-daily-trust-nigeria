The Director General of the National Metallurgical Development Centre (NMDC) in Jos, Plateau State, Engr. Linus Asuquo said at the centre Nigeria’s low- grade ores and minerals are upgraded to reduce the importation of available metals and minerals. Asuquo stated this when a team from National Space Research and Development Agency Abuja paid a visit to the center in Jos recently. In a statement, he said it will empower them to add value to the overall mineral and metal sector adding that the Centre is open to collaborations from institutions of learning, States’ institutions, corporate organisations interested in building manpower and technical know-how in mineral and metallurgical sector. The Director General of the National Space Research and Development Agency, Abuja, Prof. Spencer Onuh commended the Centre’s raise to a hub of Industrialisation for Africa. Onuh said most of the research and laboratory equipment seen during his facility tour at the Centre are capable of repositioning Nigeria in the global map of mineral and metallurgical recognition.
