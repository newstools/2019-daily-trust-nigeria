The body of civil society (CSO) in Nigeria is set to launch a mobile application to track the remediation of issues contained in the annual audit reports of the Nigeria Extractives Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI). The mobile app called RemTrack was designed and developed by Order Paper Advocacy Initiative in collaboration with the Civil Society Steering Committee (CSSC) of NEITI. It will be presented to the public on Tuesday, December 3, 2019 to mark the formal commencement of public engagement of the tool. The public presentation will be performed by the Executive Secretary of NEITI, Mr. Waziri Adio, and assisted by other dignitaries. Stakeholders from companies, civil society, the media and the development community are expected at the event. The app is designed for android and apple devices to be used in mobile phones and other hand-held devices. RemTrack has been made available for download from the Google Play and iOS App stores respectively and also has a web interface as well as purpose-built environment at the back-end for covered entities to interact on issues with NEITI per the audit reports. According to Oke Epia of Order Paper, the app will among several other benefits, stimulate informed and healthy public engagement in the extractives sector, enhance evidence-based advocacy by civil society, provide a window of automating the NEITI audit process among covered entities, aid legislative oversight, and foster investigative journalism.
