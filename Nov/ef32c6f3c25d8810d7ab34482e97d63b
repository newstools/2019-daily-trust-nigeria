The FCT Administration has commenced the enforcement of restriction of tricycle operations within the Federal Capital City (FCC).The enforcement started yesterday as security agents were stationed at strategic locations to enforce the restriction. Following the restriction, the Enforcement Committee has also issued a circular stating that “the FCTA wishes to inform the general public, particularly operators and riders of tricycles, popularly known as Keke, that under the road traffic regulations of the FCT, they are not permitted to ride in the Abuja City Centre expressways, particularly Ahmadu Bello Way, Nnamdi Azikiwe Expressway, Yakubu Gowon Crescent, Abdulsalami Abubakar Way, Obafemi Awolowo Way, Oladipo Diya Way and other major roads in the city.” According to the circular, the restriction of tricycle operations within the FCC is a component of the Safe, Functional and Efficient Traffic Management Policy of the FCTA which was launched recently by the FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello. It further stated that  the operators are allowed to operate in the Area Councils and Satellite Towns such as Nyanya, Kurudu, Orozo, Karshi, Bwari, Kubwa, Lugbe, Gwagwalada, Kwali, Abaji as well as inside the estates within the city. The Keke operators are therefore advised to limit their operations to areas where they are restricted to and avoid areas where they are not allowed to operate. Security agencies have been directed to arrest all violators of this restriction order.
