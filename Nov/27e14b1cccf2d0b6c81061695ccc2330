A man entered a bank in Nebraska and attempted to open an account with a fake $1million (about N361 million) bill. The man, whose identity is not known, entered a Pinnacle Bank branch in Havelock on Monday. He entered the branch at around 9.30am and asked to open a checking account with the fake bill. Staff at the branch found the man strange and informed him that the money he had could not be real. The largest ever bill printed by the U.S. mint totals $100,000. After persistently telling staff that the money was not fake, he gave up on trying to open an account. The unidentified man left the branch with the bill, according to the Lincoln Journal Star. Lincoln police are now reviewing CCTV footage in an attempt to identify and find him, Officer Angela Sands said. Authorities say they want to check on his welfare and make sure he was not the victim of a crime. Pinnacle Bank is headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee and operates in seven states in the US including Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia.
