The European Investment Bank (EIB) has announced a $1.1 billion lending programme to help women entrepreneurs in Africa. EIB Vice President, Ambroise Fayolle, who revealed this at ongoing Africa Investment Forum in Johannesburg, South Africa, also said the bank has signed three further agreements to boost sustainable development on the continent. The EIB expects the gender-lending initiative to allow women to play a more active role in the economies. “This initiative aims to promote female entrepreneurship,” said Fayolle, noting that female entrepreneurs will also gain business skills from the initiative. Patricia Hamisi, a Senior Manager at Malawi’s FDH Bank, said the money would help the bank enhance its long-term credit to small businesses owned by women. “The agreement comes with technical assistance which will help the bank enhance its trade financing,” said Hamisi.
