A civil rights group in Bayelsa State, the Bayelsa Rainbow Coalition for Good Governance, has advised the governor-elect of the state, Chief David Lyon, to be careful with the last minute decisions of the outgoing governor, Seriake Dickson, to avoid making early mistakes in government. Chairman of the group Barr Francis Wainwei while speaking with journalists in Yenagoa on Tuesday, explained that most of the people appointed by Dickson were not even qualified to be permanent secretaries according to the civil service rules. Governor Dickson last Friday appointed 35 new permanent secretaries into the state civil service and one commissioner into the state executive council amidst criticisms from the people of the state. The coalition chairman flanked by the Chairman of Civil Society Advance Forum for SDGs 2030, Chief Clifford Joseph Wilson, said the last minute appointments by Dickson were not in the best interest of Bayelsans but to place high wage bill on the incoming government.
