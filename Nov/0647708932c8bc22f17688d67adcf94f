A Federal High Court in Abuja has disqualified the deputy governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa State, Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo, over false information. Justice Inyang Ekwo yesterday barred Degi-Eremienyo from participating in the governorship election scheduled for Saturday, November 16, after it found him guilty of supplying false information about his education to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Justice Inyang found that the APC deputy governorship candidate gave false information in his form CF001, which contains his bio-data, as submitted to INEC for the election. The judge observed that the documents of his educational qualification carried different names. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Bayelsa had filed the action in a suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/1101/2019 challenging the documents submitted to INEC. The suit joined APC governorship candidate, David Lyon; the deputy governorship candidate, Degi-Eremienyo and INEC as respondents.
