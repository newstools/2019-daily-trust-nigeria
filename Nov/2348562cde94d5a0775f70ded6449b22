The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Zamfara State has rejected the suspension of two local council chairmen and alleged intimidation and harassment of its members by the PDP-led government in the state. At a press conference, the state chairman of the party, Alhaji Lawali M Liman, said APC in the state had rejected the new strategy of political witch-hunting against its members. “Even the so-called resolutions of the state House of Assembly clearly indicate that some of the petitioners were amorphous as they refused to appear before the house committee to defend or even affirm their signatures in the petitions as clearly mentioned in the resolutions. “In view of the above, all right thinking members in the society can clearly grasp that the house was in a hurry to suspend the duly elected local government chairmen based on unverified allegations and without regard to constitutional provisions,” he added. He said the PDP-led government which emerged not through peoples mandate but through court technicalities refused to obey court as the affected local government chairmen have filed petitions in the courts.
