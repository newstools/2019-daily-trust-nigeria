About 193 private guard personnel trained by the Rivers State command of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) completed their programme in Port Harcourt yesterday. Speaking at the passing out ceremony, the state Commandant of the NSCDC, Muktar Lawal, said they had undergone two months intensive training on security guard duties. He said the training was very important because it was a platform for those interested in the business of safeguarding lives and property to learn and improve in their corporate responsibility to the general public. He said the corps through its Private Guard Company, had put in much to tackle the challenges faced in the area of unregistered security outfits and checking quacks. “It’s indeed a thing of joy to behold these colourful guards who for the past weeks had been on intensive training. This has clearly demonstrated that we all agree that security is indeed the business of all.” He appealed to private guard organizations to take the welfare package of their guards serious by paying the minimum wage. He urged the trainees to be alert and prompt in their duties and also report unethical conducts around them to the appropriate quarters for prompt action.
