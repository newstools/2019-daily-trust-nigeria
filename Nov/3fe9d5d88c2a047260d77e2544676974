The president, Association of Northern Nigerian Students (Gamji), Haruna Yusuf Abba, has said competence and credibility will be their guiding principle in electing political leaders in 2023 and not any other consideration. Speaking with our correspondent, Abba said unfortunately, people were now counting colossal losses because their chosen leaders have failed because they were elected on the basis of affiliations, religion, ethnicity and region. Abba said they will always promote peace and unity among all students and as well as inculcate in them patriotism and love for one another irrespective of their differences. “As students we are keenly following the statements and activities of some elders from our region, This time around, we won’t allow candidates with questionable character and incompetence to lead us. Competency and credibility will guide us in 2023. “We don’t need leaders with well sewn kaftans and designers, but leaders that can address the challenges facing the northern region like, poverty, illiteracy, insecurity, banditry and kidnapping. “These among others are issues facing the region and we are tired of pretending that all is well,” he said. 2023: Power shift to South non-negotiable - APC chieftain 2023: PDP faces hurdles over ‘open ticket’ Quit notice: Northern group leaders evade arrest, go under
