Kogi Professionals in Kaduna State (KPKS) have queried the timing of the release of N10bn to the Kogi State government on the eve of an election. The group, in a statement signed by Isa Ainoko and Mrs. Mercy Ipinmisho, chairman and secretary respectively, said there seemed to be more to the issue of the release of N10bn to Kogi State beyond mere refund. The group expressed concern over what it called the hopelessness that has seized the state in recent years, noting that cultists, thugs and praise singers are now treated as royalty by politicians. “It is extremely reprehensible that a state that is completely lacking in all the indices of development and progress is also the state where extremely audacious thugs can attack a female governorship aspirant in the presence of both the Inspector-General of Police and the chairman of INEC. “It is troubling too that a government that has transparency and progressive ideals as the foundation of its populist campaign in 2015 now seems hell-bent on ensuring the exact opposite in the lives of Kogites,” the group stated.
