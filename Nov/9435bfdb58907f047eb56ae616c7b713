A former Deputy National Chairman of the PDP, Chief Olabode George, has said the management of all the political parties has become a “nuisance” and so poor. He said the current situation was not what the founding fathers of Nigeria bequeathed on the nation. George spoke at the weekend when the Northern Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) conferred him with the award of Garkuwan Matasan Najeriya. He also charged the younger generation to strive towards uniting the country. He said though the older generation tried to unite the country without succeeding, the youth should not relent. He said the older generation made the “small mistake” of trying to be honest with each other in a bid to unite the country. He said, “I plead with you, you can succeed. There are no differences. Yes, there are cultural differences but who chose where he is to be born? God decided where you would be born. You don’t know where you will go in the next round, you can’t determine that.” George said the nation, described as the giant of Africa, is yet to realize its potentials. He said the youths should not relent in their efforts at nation building and do things differently from the current way and manner political parties were being administered.
