The International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA), Abuja branch, has called on stakeholders in the capital city to assist in curbing the scourge of sexual and gender-based violence. The association made the call yesterday during its awareness walk to mark the beginning of the 16 Days Activism Against Gender-Based Violence, an international campaign to challenge violence against women and girls. The chairperson of the group, Barrister Rachael Adejo-Andrew, said the awareness walk and the entire programmes lined up for the 16 days activism became expedient because of the increasing effects of sexual and gender-based violence. She cited a recent case being handled by the association where a 70-year-old grandfather was alleged to have defiled a three-year-old girl in one of the communities. She identified culture of silence as one of the reasons for the increase in the scourge. Barrister Adejo-Andrew said activities lined up for the 16 days include a visit to the FCT Commissioner of Police to ensure that the police are on board in the investigation of gender-based violence. She added that traditional leaders and the council chairmen of all the six area councils would also be visited to engage with them. Selected places of worship, motor parks and market places are also some of the places she said the association would visit to create awareness on the effect of sexual and gender-based violence NGOs call for law enforcement commitment to end sexual, gender-based violence How violence against women can be addressed NGOs call for commitment to end sexual, gender-based violence
