The FCT police command has arrested four suspects who mugged a young woman and robbed her of her two  phones and an iPad all worth over N1 million. The robbery happened after the woman left a night club on Ademola Adetokunbo Crescent,  Wuse II, Abuja, last Saturday. City News gathered that the victim of the assault, Jombo Ibigoni, left the club at about 4:30am feeling ‘unwell’ when the suspects, pretending to be gentlemen, offered to escort her to her car but instead mugged her and stole her gadgets. The Police Area Commander, ACP Nuruddeen Sabo, who confirmed the incident to our reporters, said the woman reported the incident to the patrol team in the area which swung into action and arrested one Alex Asuquo some minutes later at the scene of the crime. He said Asuquo led the police to his accomplices, Michael Musa, Francis Ameh and Onyenka Oduagwu who were arrested in Mabushi and Jabi areas of the city. Sabo said the exhibits, an iPhone worth N560,000, a phone worth N77,000 and an iPad costing N430,000, were recovered from the suspects. He added that Asuquo was a known criminal in the area and had been arrested several times over phone theft and handbag snatching allegations. He, however, expressed concern that each time the suspect was arraigned in court, he just got a slap on the wrist hence he always return to the crime.
