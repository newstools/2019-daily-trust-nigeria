Worried by the utterances of politicians in Bayelsa State, an election monitoring group, SING Foundation, has urged all stakeholders in the state, especially those from PDP and APC, to join INEC in ensuring violence free poll in the state. The SING Nigeria team, led by the head of mobilization and coordinator of volunteers department, Mr Otobo Osborn, said having been on the ground for the past few weeks and carrying out series of engagements towards the forthcoming governorship election in the state, it observed that politicians are actually fanning the ember of violence in the state. He said: “It has to be stated that INEC alone cannot deliver a credible election in Bayelsa State if all other stakeholders in the system do not play their part in making the work of INEC less complicated. “We need to remind all and sundry about the imperatives of a free, fair, peaceful and credible election in the state. The major stakeholders already know that a credible election is a panacea to a developed society which we all publicly mouth our desire to have.” Similarly, the Movement for Sustainable Development of Igala/Bassa Nation (MOSUDIBN) has called on people of Kogi State to shun violence in all ramifications during the forthcoming gubernatorial election. This was contained in a communique issued yesterday at the end of its meeting and jointly signed by the National Chairman, Comrade Daniel Salifu and General Secretary, Comrade Ekele Okeme. The group warned that any use of thuggery and intimidation that would cause chaos and violence to disrupt the election should be avoided.
