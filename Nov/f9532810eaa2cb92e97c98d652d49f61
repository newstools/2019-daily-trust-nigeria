A 56-year-old man, Akpan Effiong, has been dragged before an Ogba, Lagos, chief magistrate court for allegedly defiling a seven-year-old girl. Effiong was charged with sexual abuse and having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor. If found guilty, he may be jailed for a minimum of 10 years. The police said that the incident happened at the defendant’s residence; No. Alafia Street, Iyana Ipaja, Lagos. The prosecutor, Mr Christopher John, urged the court to visit stiff punishment on the defendant to serve as deterrent to others who may be tempted to take advantage of the vulnerable state of under-aged female children. John said that though Effiong was married with children, he allegedly went ahead to lure the little girl into his apartment and molested her when his family members were not around. The magistrate, Mr P. E. Nwaka, granted Effiong bail in the sum of N200,000, with two sureties in like sum. Nwaka remanded him in prison custody, pending when he will perfect his bail conditions and adjourned the case till November 10, 2019.
