The Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, Amina Mohammed has said that the killing of the Kogi state women leader of PDP, Madam Achejuh Abuh in the just concluded gubernatorial election was raised at a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari. Mohammed stated this at State House after leading a delegation to pay a courtesy call on President Buhari. When asked about the discussion she had with the President on the killing in Kogi elections, she said, “Mine was to commend him for condemning the killing of the woman. We did not go into a discussion around it. But the fact that he has shown zero tolerance for it and insisted on an investigation. For us, it’s important, especially as we start this week on gender-based violence in all its ramifications.” On whether she subscribed to the idea of social media censorship as proposed by the Nigerian government, she commended the move to tackle hate speech but voiced opposition to death penalty.
