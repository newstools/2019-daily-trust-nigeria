A businessman, Ifeanyi Okoli, who allegedly imported 120,000 brands of sub-standard electric cables in 13 containers, was yesterday docked before a Federal High Court, Lagos. The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) took Okoli to court along with his co-defendant, Natures Breeze Ltd, on a three-count charge of conspiracy and importation of sub-standard goods. The SON alleged that Okoli, 34, of No 5, Igbeyin Adun Street, Shibiri, Lagos, and Natures Breeze Ltd of the same address committed the offence on or around October 31, 2019 at the latter’s warehouse. The prosecution counsel, Babatunde Alajogun, said that both defendants conspired to import the cables, “which did not comply with the Standards Organisation of Nigeria Mandatory Industrial Standard before importation.” The offences, Alajogun added, contravened Section 516 of the Criminal Code Act, 2004. Okoli, who pleaded not guilty, prayed the court to grant him a short adjournment to enable him bring his bail application. He also prayed the court to remand him in police custody, pending a date to hear his bail application. Alajogun did not oppose the defendant’s prayer. Justice Nicholas Oweibo granted the businessman’s prayer and ordered that he should be remanded in police custody. The judge also directed the suspect to bring his bail application before February 27, 2019. Oweibo then adjourned the case till February 28, 2019 for the hearing of the application.
