An Egyptian court on Monday convicted seven people to death on charges of killing a police officer and seven other policemen in an attack in southern Cairo. The Cairo Criminal Court also sentenced three co-defendants to 15 years and 15 others to 10 years in prison. It acquitted seven other defendants. All the verdicts can be appealed. The defendants were accused of attacking a police vehicle, killing an officer and seven policemen in Cairoâ€™s southern neighbourhood of Helwan in 2016. They were also accused of joining a terrorist group, possessing weapons and explosives as well as carrying out other deadly attacks on police. Egypt has seen a surge in militant attacks since the 2011 uprising that toppled long-time autocrat, Hosni Mubarak. The attacks have intensified after the military in 2013 deposed Mohammed Morsi, the first democratically elected president of Egypt. The case dated back to 2015 when the accused persons have formed a terrorist cell for assassinating police men in Helwan city, south of the capital.
