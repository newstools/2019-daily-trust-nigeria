The Chief Executive Officer, Save the Children, Kevin Watkins, who released the report at a news conference as part of activities marking the World Pneumonia Day, described pneumonia as the world’s leading infectious killer of children under the age five. He said yet, not so much attention was paid to the killer disease which he said could be prevented by vaccination. He said the data obtained from the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation 2019 and the Save the Children’s Child Inequality Tracker, indicated that the disease was a forgotten global health epidemic that demanded a greater international response as millions of children were dying for want of vaccines, affordable antibiotics and routine oxygen treatment.  162,000 Nigerian children died from pneumonia in 2018 – UNICEF Pneumonia prevention weak – Experts Pneumonia: killing more children than malaria, measles, diarrhea combined Kindly take one minute (1) of your time to fill out this short question.
