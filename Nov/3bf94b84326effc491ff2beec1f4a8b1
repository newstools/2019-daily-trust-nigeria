The Court of Appeal in Sokoto yesterday dismissed an appeal filed against the election of Senator representing Sokoto North Senatorial District, Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko. Senator Ahmed Mohammed Maccido of PDP had filed the appeal challenging the judgement of the Sokoto Election Petitions Tribunal that upheld the election of Wamakko. The tribunal had dismissed Maccidoâ€™s petition for being statute-barred, noting that it was filed out of time. Delivering Judgment in the case, Justice Hamman Akawu Barka, said the court found out that it is statute-barred. Justice Barka, therefore, dismissed the appeal.
