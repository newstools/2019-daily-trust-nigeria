The Federal High Court sitting in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State has fixed November 14, 2019 for judgement on the suit filed by the immediate past Minister of State for Agriculture and Rural Development, Senator Heineken Lokpobiri, challenging the victory of the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in the state, Chief David Lyon and the party for its disputed governorship primary held on September 4, 2019. The decision of the court, presided over by Justice Jane Inyang, to deliver its judgment on the suit filed by Lokpobiri, two days to the governorship election in the state is, however, creating tension within the fold of the APC in the state. Senator Lokpobiri had in the suit, FHC\YNG\C\100\19, applied for an order of perpetual injunction restraining APC, its officers, agents and privies from treating, presenting or holding out Lyon to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as the party’s candidate for the election. The plaintiff also sought an order of perpetual injunction stopping INEC, its officers, agents and privies from accepting or further accepting, publishing or further publishing David Lyon as the flag bearer and another order barring the electoral body from excluding him as the APC candidate. Lokpobiri wants the court to compel INEC to recognise him as the lawful candidate of APC and to accord him the rights, privileges and perquisites of a candidate of APC in the gubernatorial election. Speaking after the court session yesterday, Fitzgerald Olorogun, counsel to Lokpobiri, told newsmen that the plaintiff was done with its case and was hopeful of reclaiming his mandate. However, Barr. Sydney Ibanickuka, counsel to APC, said, “the court has been the last hope of the common man, and has always been a tool of social engineering. It should be known that the entire judiciary is on trial here, let us wait and see.”
