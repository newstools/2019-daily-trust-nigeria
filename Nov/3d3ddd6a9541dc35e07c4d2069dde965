The Court of Appeal in Abuja has dismissed the appeal filed by the APC and its governorship candidate in Benue State, Emmanuel Jime, challenging the victory of Governor Samuel Ortom at the polls. The appellate courtâ€™s panel, in a unanimous judgment delivered yesterday by Justice Fred Oho, resolved all the issues in the appeal against the appellants. Thereafter, the appeal was dismissed for lacking in merit. The appellate court also awarded a fine of N150,000 against the appellants. Meanwhile, Governor Ortom has dedicated his victory to the people of the state who, he said, gave him a second term mandate. Ortom who spoke through his Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, noted that the appellate court verdict has not only validated the earlier judgment of the Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal, but also confirmed the choice of Benue voters in the 2019 polls. Ortom however stressed that the task of building the state is the responsibility of all its people and therefore restated his call on the candidate of the APC for the 2019 governorship election, Barr Emmanuel Jime and other contestants in the election to join hands with him to develop the state. Also reacting, Jime said he had accepted the outcome of the appellate court in good faith in a statement issued by his spokesman, Kula Tersoo, in Makurdi yesterday.
