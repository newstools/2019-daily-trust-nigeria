The Court of Appeal in Abuja has upheld the re-election of Governor Darius Ishaku of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the March 9 governorship election in the state The All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidate, Abubakar Danladi had filed the appeal against the Taraba State Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal for dismissing their petition on the grounds that they failed to prove allegations of irregularities and substantial non-compliance with the Electoral Act, 2010. But a five-man panel of the appellate court led by Justice C. N. Uwa on Monday held that the APC had no candidate in the March 9 election in Taraba State by virtue of the disqualification of its candidate, Danladi by a Federal High Court in Jalingo on March 6. It also held that having failed to overturn the order of the Federal High Court that disqualified him at Court of Appeal and Supreme Court respectively, Danladi himself withdrew his participation at the tribunal.
