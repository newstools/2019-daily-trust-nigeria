The Speaker of the Bauchi State House of Assembly, Abubakar Y. Suleiman, has commended the Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) for providing safety net for bank depositors in Nigeria. The speaker who made the commendation during the 30th anniversary of the corporation in Bauchi, said, “At a point in history, Nigerians were in a state of fear as to the safety or the high level of risk associated with deposits in Nigerian banks, but thank God for NDIC, Nigerian depositors can now sleep with their two eyes closed.” The lawmaker expressed pleasure at the milestone achievements NDIC has recorded in its 30 years and therefore urged its management and staff to sustain the tempo by reminding them on the need to also focus on the shareholders because a lot of people at the grassroots were finding it difficult to access their dividends.
