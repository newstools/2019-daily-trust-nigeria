The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has vowed to go after dealers of adulterated lubricants which, it says, are causing serious economic and environmental hazards. Speaking at a workshop yesterday in Kaduna, the Acting Director, DPR, Ahmed Shakur said adulterated lubricants and base oil sold to consumers in place of lubricants have caused Nigerians billions of naira through damage to engines and machineries. Represented by the Assistant Director, Engineer Akenn Musa, the DPR director said, “I wish to reiterate here that at the end of this workshop we will come out with far-reaching resolutions and recommendations to sanitize the lubricant subsector, synergise with security agencies and major stakeholders to apprehend and prosecute anybody found storing and selling lubricants without DPR license and also adulterating it.” The North-West Zonal Operational Controller, DPR, Mallam Isah Tafida said Nigeria has 53 lube blending plants in Nigeria with a combined production capacity of 6,023,406 litres daily, noting that there was no need to import lubricants. “It is better we patronize our made in Nigeria lubricants which can compete favorably with the imported ones, considering the environmental conditions we have in Nigeria,” he stated.
