The Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria has embarked on awareness campaign to educate Nigerians on the need to pay their taxes as at when due to help government in its economic development. Chairman of the institute, Mr.Nwabuzo Emeke, said this during the opening ceremony of the tax week and awareness campaign in Abuja yesterday. He said  the importance of tax cannot be over emphasised in an emerging country like Nigeria. “Tax is key to economic growth and can’t be over emphasised. Taxes paid help government in generating revenue for a better nation. But most Nigerians are ignorant about their duty to pay tax. Sometimes their excuse is that they don’t see the value for the tax they pay and they have stopped paying. But the general truth is, government use this taxes we pay to provide adequate social amenities in the nation,” he said Also speaking, the financial secretary  of the institute Mr. Ben Enamudu, said the awareness is aimed at ensuring that Nigerians understand the importance of tax and tax related activities. “We have also organised quiz competition for three  higher institutions, Nasarawa State University, Abuja University and Veritas University to come and tell us the little they know about taxation. The winner of this competition will go home with prize worth 10,0000″. This is just a way of motivating people to come out for the awareness Program,” he added.
