A group under the aegis of Reformed Oghomwan Mandate in Edo State has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to intervene in the crisis rocking the state chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The group, in a letter to the president dated November 14 and made available to journalists in Benin, urged the president to call the national chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole, to order. According to the letter, signed by George Osagie Osaghae, the call became necessary in order “to preserve the fragile peace in Edo and save the polity from degenerating into a foreseeable crisis.” Osaghae, who also called for the sacking of the APC chairman, accused the police headquarters in Abuja of being a willing tool in the hands of the national chairman.
