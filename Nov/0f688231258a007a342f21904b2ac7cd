The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has trained visually impaired persons in Bayelsa State on the use of the ‘Braille Ballot Guide’, a new technology to aid them in voting in the  November 16, 2019 governorship poll. The Resident Electoral Commissioner of INEC in charge of the state, Pastor Monday Tom Udo, while declaring the training open in Yenagoa yesterday, explained that the initiative by the commission to introduce the device was to make persons with disabilities part of the election, saying it’s their constitutional right to do so. Udo also urged over 100 visually impaired persons who attended the training to endeavour to go out on election day and exercise their franchise, because INEC has made adequate arrangement to help them participate in the election. The Deputy Director, Civil Society Organizations Division, INEC headquarters, Mrs Lakunuya Dorothy, said the sensitization will help the visually impaired persons who are not versed in the ‘Braille’ to learn how to use it. The Chairman, Joint National Association of Persons with Disabilities, Bayelsa State chapter, Mr Ikilowei Eric, commended INEC for giving the physical challenged persons a sense of belonging through the training.
