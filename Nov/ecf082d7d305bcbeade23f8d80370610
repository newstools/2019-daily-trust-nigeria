Dana Air says it airlifted 5.4 million passengers in the last 11 years of its operations. The Media and Communications Manager of the airline, Mr. Kingsley Ezenwa, said the airline is determined to double the figure by sustaining its operational efficiency, increasing its fleet size, maintaining its record on-time performance, and raising the bar of its excellent service delivery in the coming years. Daily Trust reports that the airline recently acquired two Boeing 737 aircraft in a move to diversify its fleet base and open up more routes. Kingsley, in a statement said: “Having completed a commercial analysis of our loads in the last 11 years and confirmed it to stand at 5.4 million, we have set the ball rolling for the next nine years. “We have commenced reviewing plans and we intend to raise the bar of our operational efficiency, increase our fleet, and improve on our excellent service delivery to remain on top and keep the commitment and loyalty of our staff and guests.” With the addition of two recently acquired B737 aircraft, the airline plans to create more flights and provide massive capacity at underserved destinations within its route network this yuletide. “This is to ensure seamless travel experience for our guests to avoid the uncertainty of last year,” he added.
