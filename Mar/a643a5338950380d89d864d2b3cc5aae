The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, in Ekiti State, has warned all the regular and ad hoc staff of the commission taking part in the Saturday’s state assembly election to remain neutral and shun corrupt tendencies. The Acting Resident Electoral Commissioner in the state, Dr Muslim Omoleke, gave the warning on Thursday while interacting with journalists in Ado Ekiti ahead the Saturday election. He said the commission had distributed sensitive materials to the 16 local government areas of the state in the presence of security agencies and parties’ representatives. There will be no governorship election in the state as the present governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, was elected on July 14, 2018, leaving the state with only assembly election. Omoleke assured that the commission would not disappoint Ekiti voters with the conduct of the election. He added, “The sensitive and non-sensitive materials have been distributed to all the council areas under heavy security cover. “We are not taking anything for granted. We tracked all the vehicles to ensure that those materials were not diverted. “We did not only distribute the materials, but we partnered the security agencies to ensure that they are on ground in all the LGs to protect them till Saturday. “ INEC transfers Ekiti REC Ekiti poll: INEC says sensitive materials are intact Borno INEC reconfigures 5071 smartcard readers
