The Kano State Government has said that contrary to speculations, there was no crisis in the state, following announcement of results of the just concluded re-run election that saw Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje victorious. Addressing a press conference today, the state’s Commissioner of Information, Malam Muhammad Garba said the state was peaceful with people going about their businesses. Garba said the Ganduje-led administration was doing everything possible within its power to ensure safety of lives and property, saying government would continue to promote peace and harmony in the state. The commissioner also debunked allegation of loss of lives during the re-run election, noting that “when the PDP claimed that two lives were lost in Nassarawa local government during the poll, we went to the area and hospitals for the purpose of investigation, but believe me, we could not establish the claim. “So, I debunked this claim and challenge anybody with information of loss of lives during the rerun election to come forward. We need such information so that can investigate the case.” Garba also debunked the claim that there was a peaceful demonstration allegedly organised by some youth in order to show their annoyance over announcement of the re-run election’s results by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). He said there was nothing like demonstration conducted by youth in Kano after the announcement of the results.
