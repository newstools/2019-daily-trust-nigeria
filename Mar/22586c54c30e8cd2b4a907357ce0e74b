Yoruba community leaders in Plateau State have been cautioned against dragging the entire ethnic group into partisan politics, saying it was dangerous for community leaders to be seen to identify with a particular political party. Members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Concerned Yoruba Forum while sounding the word of caution in Jos stated that, “among the Yorubas people belong to different parties and community leaders are fathers to all. It is unfair for them to use the umbrella body of all Yoruba people in Plateau State to align with one political party against the other.” The group leader, Jacob Okunade, explained that, “we are politicians let us do the politics, we are mobilising our people to vote APC while Yoruba people in the PDP are doing the same but the community leaders are fathers to all, they should remain so.” He described as unfortunate that some community leaders had gone begging  politicians soon after the Oba of Yoruba in the state passed away early in January. On his part, the chairman of the group, Nathaniel Dare, who was born in Plateau State said there was need to caution community leaders to ensure certain persons do not plunge the entire ethnic group into bad repute. “You will find that somebody who came here about 10 years ago will go about discussing controversial issues that may incite a section of the community against another because the person doesn’t know the complexities of the state. We have lived here for years and we have mixed with the different ethnic groups so we don’t want problems. Politicians should be politicians and community leaders should be community leaders.”  2019: Can Obasanjo’s romance with Yoruba leaders stop Buhari?
