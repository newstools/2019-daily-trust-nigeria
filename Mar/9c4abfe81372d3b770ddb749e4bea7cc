The Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigerian (CBCN) has announced that Catholics in Nigeria would on Wednesday join their counterparts worldwide to mark the 2019 Ash Wednesday, and the beginning of the Lent Season of fasting. The President of CBCN, Bishop Augustine Akubeze, said on Tuesday in Abuja in a statement that the Lenten season was a period during which Christians were encouraged to intensify prayers, abstinence, fasting and alms giving for 40 days. Akubeze, who is also the Catholic Archbishop of Benin City, commended Nigerians who came out for the Presidential and National Assembly elections, and urged all registered voters to come out massively for the gubernatorial and state assembly elections scheduled for March 9. He urged all security agencies to remain non-partisan and to protect every Nigerian. “As we, Christians, begin the Lenten Season on Ash Wednesday, I call on all of us to be conscious of the three pillars of Lent; fasting, alms giving and prayers. Let us all be involved in these spiritual exercises. “Through fasting, we are able to conquer our concupiscence, and recognise that God has given us the power to overcome all temptations. Through alms-giving, we are able to share our resources with those who are in need. This act helps us to know that we belong to one family of God,” he said.
