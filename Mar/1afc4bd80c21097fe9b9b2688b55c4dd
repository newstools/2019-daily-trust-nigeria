The Conference of Nigerian Political Parties (CNPP) in Ekiti State has appealed to the presidential candidate of PDP, Atiku Abubakar, to drop his intention to challenge the victory of President Muhammadu Buhari. The group urged Atiku to put Nigeria above primordial sentiment by respecting the verdict of the citizens who demonstrated their love for Buhari through the ballots. CNPP insisted that Atiku resorting to court action despite the credibility of the poll as adjudged by local and international observers would be tantamount to pursuing personal agenda and taking actions that could immerse the nation into crisis. Speaking with journalists in Ado Ekiti, yesterday, CNPP chairman in Ekiti State, Deacon Olu Akomolafe, praised INEC for not reneging on the promise to launch Nigeria’s image on the global map of a country that has accepted democracy via a free and fair election. Akomolafe said the elections of February 23 attained international standard, stressing that no Nigerian with interest in the country’s unity would take legal action against the verdict of the masses.
