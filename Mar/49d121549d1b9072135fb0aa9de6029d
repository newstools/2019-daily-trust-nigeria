Speaker of Kogi State House of Assembly and member-elect representing Kabba/Bunu State Constituency,  Prince Matthew Kolawole, says Governor Yahaya Bello will have a landslide victory in the November 2019 governorship election in the state. Kolawole, who spoke in Lokoja, yesterday, said the outcome of the  just concluded presidential, national and state assembly elections in the state had “shown clearly” that the All Progressives Congress (APC) is “fully in charge of the state.” He said the “outstanding performance” of the party in the elections would not have been possible without the concerted efforts of Governor Bello whom he described as “the youngest Governor in Nigeria”. According to him, “the doggedness and determination” of Alhaji Yahaya Bello to right the wrongs of his predecessors in the state were yielding fruits, noting that another four years of the administration will consolidate on the “monumental achievements” recorded in the last three and half years. He said despite the party’s loss of one senatorial seat and two House of Representatives seats in Kogi West, “the people are more determined now to vote massively for Governor Yahaya Bello having realised his heart of love for them”. 2019: Kogi West endorses Buhari, adopts Bello Youth group seeks Oshiomhole's intervention over alleged imposition of Senator Adeyemi Kogi lawmakers approve 4 more special advisers for Governor Bello
