A three-storey building building located on Kakawa Street, Campos, Lagos Island, yesterday collapsed. A three-storey building had on March 13 collapsed in the Ita-Faaji area of Lagos Island, killing about 20 persons, including school children. Few days later, a similar incident occurred at Oke-Arin, Lagos Island. Reacting to the yesterday’s incident, the Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Prince Rotimi Ogunleye, in a statement by the ministry’s Assistant Director, Public Affairs, Olubukonla Nwonah, said no life was lost. “The building in question had been identified as distressed by the officers of the LASBCA and all the necessary statutory notices had been duly served. It was one of the defective structures marked for removal by the Agency. “Fortunately, occupants had been evacuated before the incidents occurred. Immediately, the Lagos State Rescue Team and LASBCA were alerted and they moved to site promptly to check all adjoining buildings so as to evacuate the occupants to avoid any further hazards. “Already 25 buildings have been removed by LASBCA as the Government has stepped up measures to rid the State of distressed buildings so as to prevent loss of lives and property due to sudden collapse in the State,” he. The commissioner disclosed that relief and resettlement centres had been opened to accommodate those affected. He asked occupants of marked distressed buildings across the state to immediately vacate them pending the arrival of the demolition team of the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA) so as to avoid loss of lives and property.
