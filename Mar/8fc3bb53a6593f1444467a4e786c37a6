An Akure High Court yesterday sentenced Seidu Adeyemi, the lover of the slain daughter of the former deputy governor of the state, Khadijat Oluboyo, to death by hanging for killing her. The Ondo State police had arraigned Adeyemi, a graduate of the Federal University of Technology, Akure, (FUTA) in court for killing Khadijat on July 2, 2018, after which he buried her in his room inside his father’s house at Oke Aro, Akure. In his judgment, Justice Samuel Bola said all the pieces of evidence before the court affirmed that Adeyemi killed Khadijat, and found him guilty of the crime. According to Justice Bola, evidences from the pathologist indicated that the convict strangulated Khadijat to death and buried her remains in his room after shaving her hair and removing two of her teeth. The judge noted that the defendant failed to establish his innocence in the crime as he failed to raise any alarm when the two men he claimed had invaded his room killed Khadijat and ordered him to bring a shovel to dig the ground in his room to bury her. The judge also pointed out Adeyemi kept the killing a secret for five days until his immediate junior brother disclosed to their father the convict’s plan to dispose of the decomposing body. He said the accused could not give satisfactory evidence to absolve himself from the death of the deceased, saying all evidences proved that the young lady was not killed by two unknown men but by the defendant himself.
