The Coalition of Southern Kaduna Nationalities (CSKN) has threatened to leave the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, if the party fails to explain why most of its leaders in Kaduna State lost their constituencies. Addressing a press conference in Kaduna, the leader of the CSKN Dr. Yusuf Gandu Magaji said it was worrisome that the PDP governorship candidate, Alhaji Isa Ashiru and other leaders of the party failed to deliver their constituencies at the just concluded National Assembly and Presidential elections. The Southern Kaduna political leaders said it was unacceptable for the PDP candidate and the other leaders to post the poor result the party returned for the February 23, elections in their various wards and local governments. He said “the Southern Kaduna Nationalities are disenchanted by the voting pattern as revealed by the results from the Zone”, saying they believed that there was a betrayal of confidence and trust on the part of the leaders of the party from the zone. The coalition threatened to switch support to another party if the PDP failed to explain what it called “woeful performance” of the Party in the Northern part of the state and gave the PDP 24 hours to respond. The xoalition said it will abandon the party if answers were not provided within the 24-hour ultimatum.
