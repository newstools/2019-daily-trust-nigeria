Algeria’s army chief of staff has demanded President Abdelaziz Bouteflika be declared unfit to rule after weeks of protests against him. Speaking on television, Lt Gen Ahmed Gaed Salah said: “We must find a way out of this crisis immediately, within the constitutional framework.” The president has already agreed not to stand for a fifth term in upcoming elections, which have been delayed. Demonstrators accuse the 82-year-old of a ploy to prolong his 20-year rule. Talks have been set up to oversee the country’s political transition, draft a new constitution and set the date for elections. But they do not yet have a date to start. Protests against Mr Bouteflika began last month after the president, who has rarely been seen in public since suffering a stroke in 2013, said he planned to stand for another term. But people have continued to march even after he agreed not to stand, instead demanding immediate change. Lt Gen Gaed Salah – who is also deputy defence minister and seen as loyal to Mr Bouteflika – has previously said the military and the people had a united vision of the future, hinting at the armed forces’ support for the demonstrators.
