A Kano renowned Qur’anic reciter, Sheikh Ahmad Sulaiman has been kidnapped by unknown gunmen along Sheme-Kankara road in Katsina state. The Chief Imam of Government House Juma’at mosque, Ustaz Mujtaba Ibrahim Abubakar, broke the news of the kidnapping shortly after the Juma’at congregational prayer at the Government House, Kano. He said the scholar was kidnapped alongside five other clerics who were on their way back to Kano from Kebbi state. “I am appealing to the kidnappers of these scholars to fear Allah and save the lives of these innocent people. For the Muslim ummah, I urged you to pray for these scholars and other people that were kidnapped,” he said. The Chief Imam called on security agencies to intensify search for the scholars with a view to rescuing them alive. He also appealed to government to improve security in the areas identified as worst hit by the activities of kidnappers.
