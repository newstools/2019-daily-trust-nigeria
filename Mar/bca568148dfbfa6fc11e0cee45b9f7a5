The management of the Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) yesterday issued a final warning against conducting activities under and within the perimeters of high tension (HT) power lines. The Disco also advised that such areas be vacated with immediate effect. The warning was issued in a statement signed by the EKEDC General Manager, Corporate Communications, Mr Godwin Idemudia, in Lagos. Idemudia said the decision was the Disco’s bid to remain committed to the safety of lives and properties. “Eko Disco has embarked on several safety enlightenment campaigns that emphasize the hazards involved in building, trading, loading vehicles, hoisting flags, installing antennas and planting trees around electricity installations. We place high premium on the lives and properties of people within our network,” he said. He reiterated the dangers of being within the safety clearance space advised by the company and other electricity bodies, and urged the people to stay away from HT power lines “as it is mandatory to keep the distance of 5.5 meters on both sides of 11kv and 33kv HT power lines, and 25 metres away from 330kv HT power lines.” He added that the EKEDC had been directed by the Nigerian Electricity Management Services Agency (NEMSA) to disconnect public power supply systems of any structures, buildings and premises built under HT power lines.
