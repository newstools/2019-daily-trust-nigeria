Some women groups in Bauchi state have appealed to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct a rerun election to counter rigging. The women who conducted a peaceful demonstration in Bauchi yesterday demanded the conduct of rerun election in all parts of the state affected including Tafawa Balewa local government. Speaking to journalists on their demands, Spokesperson of the group, Hajiya Fatima Umar and the state coordinator of the group, Salamatu Ladan, asked INEC to reconsider its decision to continue with the coalition of result in Tafawa Balewa. They opined that INEC should instead conduct rerun elections in the interest of justice and fairness. “We opposed the decision of the electoral body (INEC) to continue with the collation process of the governorship election results in the state which was earlier declared inconclusive by the state Returning Officer. According to her, the original result of Tafawa Balewa local government area was carted away by thugs at the collation centre and that the result which INEC intends to regenerate will not be accepted by the APC. It could be recalled that the PDP had 469,512 votes while the APC had 465,453 votes in the results announced so far. The results indicated that the PDP candidate is ahead with 4,059 votes in the results of 19 out of 20 local governments earlier announced by  INEC. The result of Tafawa Balewa local government was earlier rejected before INEC decided to re-collate which was halted by a Court Order on Tuesday.
