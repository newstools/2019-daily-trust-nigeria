A Yoruba socio-cultural group in Kwali area council has declared support for the APC chairmanship candidate,  Mr.  Danladi Bomboi Chiya,  in the Saturday rerun election in the area. Addressing newsmen in Kwali, yesterday, the group’s spokesman, Alhaji Ibrahim Olawale,  said  the group was supporting the APC candidate to ensure the party’s victory during the rerun election because of the performance of the outgoing incumbent chairman,  Joseph Shazin. He said the ruling APC would emerge victorious during the rerun election because of the massive support it has been enjoying, especially from the youth across the council. He said the Yoruba ethnic group in the area have felt the impact of the APC-led administration under the leadership of Joseph Shazin  hence,  their resolve to give full support to his successor, Danladi Bomboi Chiya. “And even as we speak, we  the Yoruba group have unanimously resolved to come out en masse to give our total support to the APC chairmanship candidate,  Danladi Bomboi Chiya, during Saturday’s  rerun election,” he said. He said the APC chairmanship candidate must be allowed to replicate a purposeful leadership that will enhance the lives of people of Kwali area council.
