The Managing Director of Ecobank Nigeria, Patrick Akinwuntan, has said the bank is supporting women to help them promote and grow their businesses and generally position them for increased participation, validation and contribution to the society. In a statement from the bank on Friday, he said that was the reason why the bank launched the “Ecobank Female Entrepreneurs Initiative.” According to him, the initiative is a platform designed to recognise women as special and unique customers who require tailor-made service offerings. He noted that the concept is designed to provide women with the necessary support to help them excel in their endeavours. “Increasingly, we are seeing the change in the attitudes of women, and their economic viability as individuals and leaders in their fields. Their banking and financial services as a whole therefore present vast opportunities, if properly understood and managed,” he said. Akinwuntan further said the launch is a charge to the society to challenge the status quo and strive for a balance in gender equality by empowering females in their immediate environments and subsequently, on a macro level. He added: “Our female customers will become our flagship ambassadors and we have created this platform for them in line with the sustainability requirements of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). “The Ecobank Female Entrepreneurs Initiative aims at empowering women by helping them build capacity to grow their businesses. “These women will be provided with free health checks, training and empowerment sessions and other support tools from Ecobank.” Ecobank celebrates Customer Service Week, pledges to meet customers’ aspirations Ecobank renews partnership with Alaba traders, launches EcobankPay Zone Ecobank to support MSMEs growth with its digital assets – MD
