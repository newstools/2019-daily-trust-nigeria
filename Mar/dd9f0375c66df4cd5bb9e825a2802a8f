A former commissioner for information in Kogi State and member of President Muhammadu Buhari’s re-election campaign council, Dr. Tom Ohikere, has said Mr President and the ruling APC are determined not to repeat the 2015 mistakes as the jostling for the leadership of the ninth National Assembly continues. Ohikere, who said this, yesterday in Abuja, stressed that any attempt by the main opposition, the PDP, to foist their own design on the National Assembly would not work. He said President Buhari and all structures within the APC were determined to see that all key and important positions in the legislative chambers were ceded to members of the party in a bid to ensure harmonious executive-legislative working relationship, as opposed to what transpired in the 8th National Assembly. Ohikere said: “We know about the scheming by the PDP to be a deciding voice in the distribution of important positions both in the Senate and the House of Representatives. But I must say, it won’t be possible because this time around our party has a clear majority and does not have the treacherous characters again. “There have been meetings between key organs of the party and elected representatives on the platform of the APC. President Muhammadu Buhari and the leadership of the party are determined not to repeat the mistakes of 2015 that lead to the emergence of Saraki, Ekweremadu, Dogara and co,” he said. 2019: APC will make strong show in PDP states-Ohikere predicts Buhari set for record breaking – Ohikere Customs CG, Hammed Ali, takes Buhari's re-election campaign to Karamajiji
