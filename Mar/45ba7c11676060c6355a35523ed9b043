The Minister of Water Resources, Engr. Suleman Adamu, has said that 52.7 million Nigerians have no access to water supply in the country. The Minister spoke at Iyamho, during the third founders’ day of the Edo University, Iyamho, Etsako West Local Government Area of Edo State. Delivering a lecture titled “Water, Sanitation and Hygiene”, Adamu said majority of the figure are concentrated in rural areas. He said in 2015, the National Water Supply Coverage (NWSC) was 69 per cent. “Inadequate water and sanitation infrastructure, population increase and rapid urbanization have created a serious deficiency in the quality of life of an average Nigerian with dire consequences on sanitation, food, security, health, employment and standard of living,” he said. Represented by the Managing Director of Benin-Owena River Basin Development Authority, Engr. Ahmed Saliu, Adamu, he said the ministry has developed immediate and long-term strategies for the water sector. He said Nigeria was not able to meet the Millennium Development Goals Target on access to water supply as a result of the decline in access to water in rural areas. Adamu noted that with the water sector road map, concerted efforts must be put in place towards achieving 100 per cent access to water supply by 2030. Earlier, Governor Godwin Obaseki said plans have been put in place to partner world class universities. “This was a goal we set out when we established this university. They’ve done well, but there’s still a lot to be done. Our goal is to make this university a global institution that can compare with anyone anywhere in the world’’, he said. On his part, the Vice Chancellor of the university, Prof. Emmanuel Aluyor, said the plan is to put the Edo University on the map of the world as a world-class institution. 52.7m Nigerians have no access to water supply Water Day: '52.7m Nigerians have no access to water supply' 100m Nigerians lack access to sanitation facilities - FG
