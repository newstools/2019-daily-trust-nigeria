Slovak prosecutors have charged a Slovak businessman with ordering the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak and his fiancée last year – a case that triggered mass protests. Kuciak and Martina Kusnirova, both aged 27, were shot dead in February 2018. Slovak police confirmed the charge on Facebook, without naming the suspect. The protests last year prompted Prime Minister Robert Fico to resign. Four others were charged by investigators last year.
