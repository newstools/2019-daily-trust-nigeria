The Police Command in Kebbi State on Friday advised politicians to desist from thuggery, hate speech, voter card buying, and other acts capable of breaching the peace in the state. The state’s Commissioner of Police, Mr Garba Danjuma, gave the advice at a news conference in Birnin Kebbi. “I want to use this medium to intimate politicians, contestants, party supporters and all stakeholders to desist from hate speech, thuggery, buying voters cards and eschew any form of violence,” he said. Danjuma further said that the command would not hesitate to deal decisively with any person or group under any guise that engaged in any act aimed at disrupting the peace being enjoyed in the state. He, therefore, warned persons harbouring such intentions to shelve such plans as the police and other security agencies would be on hand to arrest anybody found to have committed electoral offences and prosecute them. According to the CP, the command has deployed adequate security personnel such as conventional police mobile force, special prosecution unit, explosive ordinance device, and other security agencies to maintain security at polling units and ward collation centres. “I call on people of Kebbi State to please give the security maximum cooperation and support to make us serve you better because importance of security in our society cannot be over emphasised,” he said.
