The Federal Government has charged commercial banks in the country to support indigenous software developers in their banking operations. Director General of the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) Dr. Isa Pantami said given the massive deployment of technology in the banking sector, the commercial banks should help in grooming indigenous software developers. He spoke in Lagos during a two-day roundtable conference on the use of local software in the financial sector organized by the CWG Plc. He said the banks would save enormous resources by supporting indigenous developers. Pantami noted that the indigenous developers may not have the capabilities required by the banking industry but “We must create conditions and systems that will enable us successfully develop ours. Hopefully when we rise from these conversations, we would have identified a sustainable path and realistic timeline to reverse this trend and grow our local industry.” The Assistant General Manager, Access Bank, Mr. Toye Soladoye, urged Nigerian software developers to raise their bar to attract sufficient patronage from commercial banks. He said the banking sector operations require efficient and reliable software to run their businesses.
