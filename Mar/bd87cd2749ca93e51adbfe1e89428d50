A resident of Ungwan Barde in Kajuru Local Government of Kaduna State, identified as Danbuzu Nemi, has been reportedly killed while another has been declared missing in a fresh crisis in the community. Nemi was said to have left for his farm shortly after voting on Saturday and did not return by evening of that day. A source said when some members of the community noticed his absence, they decided to send a team of five persons to go and search for him. The source said the team, on their way, met some armed men by a small stream who asked them to go back leading to an exchange between the two groups. He said, “As the five persons, who were on bikes turned to go, they were given a hot chase by the armed men and in the process, four escaped but one of them fell and has not been seen since yesterday. Jonah Luka Sarki, village head of Doka, when contacted, confirmed the incident, saying while the remains of the first missing person had been found, there was no trace of the other person who he identified as Danlami. He said the area is however, calm as there were security agents in the area. The Kaduna State Government also confirmed the attack at Ungwan Barde community and extended its sympathy to the community and the families of the victims. The statement by Samuel Aruwan, media assistant to the Kaduna governor said the government was appealing for calm in the area and urging all communities to uphold peace.
