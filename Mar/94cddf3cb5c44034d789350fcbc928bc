Gunmen have attacked a convoy of trucks carrying uranium fuel to a nuclear power plant near the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, police say. The convoy came under attack as it drove past a community controlled by drug traffickers in Angra dos Reis, a tourist city 145km (90 miles) from Rio. Police escorting the convoy responded and a shootout followed. No-one was injured or detained. The convoy reached the Angra 2 plant safely 20 minutes after the attack. The attack in the Rio-Santos highway is the latest in a series of violent incidents in an area popular with visitors. In 2017, a British woman was shot and wounded after her family’s car drove by mistake into a community run by gangs.
