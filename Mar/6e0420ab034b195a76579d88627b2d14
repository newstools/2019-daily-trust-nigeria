Ahead of the March 9 Governorship and State House of Assembly election, some members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Esan South East local government area of Edo state have decamped to .the All Progressives Congress (APC). Receiving the defectors on Monday, the state chairman of APC, Barr. Anselm Ojezua, said the decision of the defectors was timely as the party was working at a decisive victory for its candidates at the state House of Assembly poll. He noted that the APC in the state needed formidable representations at the House of Assembly to support the strides being achieved by the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration. Ojezua said, “Illushi is very important in Esan South East local government because of its strong political base and agrarian nature. I believe that receiving leaders from that locality will make the March 9 election easy for us.” On their part, the State Commissioner for Women Affairs and Social Development, Magdalene Ohenhen, and Chairman, Esan South-East council,  Victor Emuakhagbon, assured  that APC will emerge victorious in the area. Ohenhen said, “For us in Esan South East local government, we are happy because we now have a stronger team that will work towards ensuring victory for APC in the March 9 election. “We had issues at Illushi during the Presidential and National Assembly elections, and we are happy they have come to join us today.” Speaking on behalf of the defectors, Chris Ojimar, said their decision to join the ruling APC is to strengthen the party in the area. “We will ensure that APC wins in our various communities in Esan South-East during the state assembly election,” he said. 2016 Governorship: Political activities resurrect in Edo Ceaseless defections rock Edo again as 2015 draws near Edo governorship tears power ‘blocs’ apart
