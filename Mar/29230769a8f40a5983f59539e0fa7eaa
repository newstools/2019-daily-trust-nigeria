Gabon’s President Ali Bongo does not have a body double, the AFP has quoted his spokesman as saying. There have been rumours that a lookalike has been standing in for the 60-year-old leader, who is convalescing in Morocco after suffering from a stroke while in Saudi Arabia in October. Ike Ngouoni said there was no need to be concerned about Mr Bongo’s health. “The president is indeed there [in Morocco]. He’s the one on the job.” Mr Bongo has returned to Gabon only twice for short trips since falling ill.
