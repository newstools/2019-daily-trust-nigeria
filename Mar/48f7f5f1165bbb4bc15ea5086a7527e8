During cross-examination by the State Counsel, Mrs E. O. Osula, Achugboe, alleged that purported statement was not written by him. ”The police locked me up in a cell and brought me out at midnight and asked me to corporate by signing a statement they had already written. “They beat me up with a gun butt and tear gassed the cell I was locked in and ordered me to sign it. I eventually did in order not to lose my life,” he said. Testifying, the Investigating Police Office, Mrs Joy Ojo, who is a Principal Witness, told the court that the accused willingly and without any form of intimidation or coercion, signed the statement. ”The suspect signed the statement I had prepared after I had read it out to him.
