The son of Liberia’s ex-President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has been charged with economic sabotage in connection with the unlawful printing of local currency worth millions of dollars. Charles Sirleaf is suspected of pocketing some of the proceeds in 2016-18. He was a deputy governor of Liberia’s Central Bank at the time. Four other ex-bank officials were also charged. Two of them are on the run. The accused have so far made no comments on the allegations. An independent report into the missing millions was released last week. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, president of the West African country from 2006 to 2018, was credited with bringing economic stability after years of conflict.
