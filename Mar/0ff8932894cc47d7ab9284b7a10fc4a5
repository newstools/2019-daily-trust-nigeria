A chieftain of All Progressives Congress (APC) and former deputy governorship candidate in Anambra State, under APC, Dozie Ikedife Jnr, has urged Atiku Abubakar in the February 23 poll to congratulate Muhammadu Buhari, rather than wasting resources in court. According to him, Atiku should join hands with the APC government to move Nigeria to the next level. Ikedife said President Muhammadu Buhari’s victory was expected as well as deserving “because of his track record in the concluding first tenure”, stressing that in every contest a winner must emerge. He asked Ndi Igbo to re-strategize now on how and who would be the Igbo presidential candidate in 2023. “If you look at the President’s acceptance across the nation, it has increased tremendously. So, that is something to celebrate. I’m very happy that Nigerians have given President Buhari new political capital to govern us for another four years. This is what we expected because we told our people to support APC so that in 2023 an Igbo man can lay claim to the presidency under the APC platform. And it has happened,” he said. He appealed to the Igbo to rally round the Buhari’s second tenure administration and expect more patronages from the Federal Government Ikedife said he expected more Ndi-Igbo to show presence in the APC because “they are the people at the gate now, hanging around the periphery waiting to take over from President Buhari in four years’ time.” “It is tough to lose an election. It is tough to lose in a very competitive race like this. I think with time the shock to the opposition will sink in and the emotion will die down and they will make that important phone call expected of them, that is, to congratulate President Buhari on his well-deserved victory,” he said.
