Zamfara state government has concluded plans to recruit more civilian JTF from across the 14 local government councils of the state, the state commissioner for local government and chieftaincy affairs, Alhaji Bello Dankande Gamji has disclosed. Speaking  shortly after a closed-door meeting with the Fulani traditional leaders in Gusau, Alhaji Dankande Gamji said the recruited CJTF would subsequently undergo training on counter terror fighting before being  deployed to  forests to fight armed bandits. He said the arrangement was  aimed at putting an end to all killings, abductions and cattle rustlings, armed banditry and other  related crimes adding that the government would not fold its arms just watching criminals terrorising  innocent people in the state. The commissioner lamented the incessant brutal attacks by bandits on innocent communities across the state. He said the state government in collaboration with the federal government needed to gear up to ensure that armed banditry is brought to a halt. “No stone will  be left unturned pertaining armed banditry in Zamfara state. Our gallant security personnel, in collaboration with vibrant civilian JTF, have embarked on intelligence gathering with a view to finally identify all dangerous camps and other hideouts operated by the bandits for destructions, arrest and prosecution”, Dankande has assured. He further appealed to the people to support the security agencies, especially in the rural areas, on how to identify, arrest and prosecute informants in the  communities who are feeding the bandits with information.
