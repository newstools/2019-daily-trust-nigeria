The North East Youth Buhari Support Group has endorsed the African Democratic Congress (ADC) candidate in Adamawa State, Abdulaziz Nyako, for the Saturday’s governorship election. Addressing journalists in Yola, yesterday, the Director General of the group, Aliyu Usman Waziri, said the group, which worked for the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, President Muhammadu Buhari in the last election, would support the ADC candidate at the governorship level in view of his competence. He noted that the group joined forces with Nyako because the APC candidate, Governor Muhammadu Jibrilla, failed to improve healthcare, education and other important sectors in the last four years. According to him, the group was only taking advantage of President Buhari’s suggestion in which he asked party members to vote for credible candidates across political parties. He said Senator Nyako had consistently demonstrated leadership ability and concern for the plight of his constituents through his representation of Adamawa Central at the Senate. “Abdul-Aziz of ADC has proven his worth based on his quality representation in the Senate and the fact that he played a vital role in the passage of the  Not Too Young to Run and North East Development Commission bills.” In Adamawa, Bindo to battle APC chieftains for re-election How presidential polls will affect gov’ship elections 2019:  Gov.
