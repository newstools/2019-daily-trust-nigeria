The Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari, on National Assembly Matters (Senate), Senator Ita Enang, has said that the results of the February 23 Presidential and National Assembly elections in the state were manipulated. Enang said yesterday in Uyo that the results of the election did not reflect the reality in the state, alleging that the results were manipulated by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in connivance with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Enang called on party supporters not to be discouraged by the results, adding that though the level of compromise during the last elections was complex it was being addressed.  …They’ll campaign for Buhari — Enang PDP accuses INEC of hoarding election result sheets More troubles for Enang, Buhari’s Senate aide
