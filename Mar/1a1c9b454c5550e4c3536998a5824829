Iraq’s parliament has sacked the governor of the northern province of Nineveh where more than 100 people died when a ferry capsized three days ago, triggering grief and anger among residents. Most of those who drowned in the Tigris River near Mosul were women and children celebrating the Nowruz holiday and Mother’s Day on Thursday. Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi on Saturday called on legislators to fire Nineveh Provincial Governor Nawfel Akoub, citing “negligence and concrete failings”. His two deputies were also fired during a vote in the national assembly. Parliament declared those killed in the tragedy “martyrs”, allowing their families to receive financial compensation and paving the way for court proceedings. At least 16 people have been arrested as part of an investigation into the sinking of the ferry, a security official said. Authorities said 63 people were still listed as missing. On Sunday, dozens of students held a silent protest on the campus of the University of Mosul, dressed in black to mourn the victims.
