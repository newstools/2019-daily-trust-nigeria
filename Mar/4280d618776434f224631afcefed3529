Police in Kano have urged supporters of political parties that participated in the state governorship and House of Assembly elections to desist from early celebration of victory ahead of INEC’s official announcement of the results of the polls. The spokesman of the state’s police command DSP Haruna Abdullahi gave the charge late Saturday in a statement issued to the media stressing that the celebration may result to violent reactions that may jeopardise the peace of the state. He asked them to patiently wait for the electoral umpire to announce the results before any celebration, vowing that the police would decisively deal with anyone caught fomenting troubles in the name of a bogus victory. According to the PPRO, “the Kano state policecommand has observed how some political gladiators in the state commenced celebrations of victory in some places. the command is categorically putting it clear to all and sundry that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) should be allowed to finish collating the results and declare the authentic winners before any celebration. This is to maintain peace and harmony and do away with any incident of accident and breach of peace. “Any person or persons that engage in such celebrations leading to breach of peace will be arrested and prosecuted as provided by the law” the statement added.
