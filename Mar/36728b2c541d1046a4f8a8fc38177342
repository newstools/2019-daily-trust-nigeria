A Nigerian Daniel Akpan, 29, and a Ghanaian Ishmael Akyene, 34, have been charged with a series of offences including rape after a group of British schoolgirls was attacked at gunpoint in Ghana. Armed men had entered accommodation where the pupils and their teachers were staying during a school trip to Ghana in December. Police said a Ghanaian security guard was shot and the female victims were “subjected to serious sexual assaults”. Some of their possessions were stolen. Police in the UK said Akyene and Akpan had been charged by Ghanaian police with robbery, rape, conspiracy to rape, possession of a firearm, possession of an instrument intended for unlawful entry and money laundering. Both men have been remanded in custody. A search is continuing to find a third suspect. Police say the victims are continuing to be supported by specially-trained police officers, their school and other agencies. ‘We Were Violated and Forced to Keep Quiet’ NSCDC busts trafficking syndicate, rescues victims in Bayelsa As Ghana mass deports Nigerians
