President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated the National Leader of All Progressives Congress (APC) Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu on his 67th birthday, coming up on Friday. Buhari, in a statement by his spokesperson, Femi Adesina, described Tinubu as one of the strong pillars of Nigeria’s democracy. He joined the APC family in celebrating the Asiwaju of Lagos, who is also the Jagaban of Borgu Kingdom in Niger state, for his selflessness in serving his country, and making life better for many. The president recalled some of the sacrifices of the party chieftain to include standing up against injustice in 1993 when the June 12 elections were annulled, which led to his going on political exile for many years, and a protracted legal battle with the Federal Government when funds for Lagos were withheld. “Asiwaju’s uncompromising posture in the face of injustice and refusal to follow the path of least resistance for personal gains stand him out today as a rare breed and one of the cornerstones of Nigeria’s democracy, especially with his track record of persistence, consistency and effective leadership. “As the father of modern Lagos state, the President commends the visionary and inclusive leadership style that the Asiwaju provided for the commercial nerve centre of Nigeria for eight years, laying the foundation for a modern and technologically-driven city, and ensuring that every successive leader in the state sticks with the masterplan of a greater Lagos,” he said. Buhari rejoiced with family members, friends, political and business associates of the Jagaban on the birthday, “which is further brightened with the many successes recorded at the recently concluded polls by his strong leadership. “The President believes the best years of the APC National Leader are still ahead, praying that the Almighty God will grant him longer life, good health and more wisdom to keep serving the country he loves so much.” Rift between Buhari, Tinubu over ministerial list Inside South-West’s big 2019 moves Atiku, Tinubu  consider plan ‘B’
