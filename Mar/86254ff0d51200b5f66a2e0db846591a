Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has denied wrongdoing after he tried to shield one of the country’s biggest firms from a graft trial. Mr Trudeau said any lobbying by him or his inner circle for engineering giant SNC-Lavalin was done to protect jobs. Ex-Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould testified she faced “sustained” pressure to abandon prosecution of the Quebec-based firm. Opposition Conservatives called on the PM to resign.  They are want a public inquiry following Ms Wilson-Raybould’s testimony on Wednesday before the Commons justice committee in Ottawa. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Mr Trudeau disagreed with his former justice minister’s “characterisation” of events and maintained his staff followed the rules. The prime minster said he had full confidence in an inquiry by a parliamentary justice committee into the affair and in an investigation by the federal ethics commissioner, and would “participate fully” in that process.
