The Bayelsa State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has warned the All Progressives Congress (APC) against disrespecting the Ijaw National Leader, Pa Edwin Clark and other leaders of South South and Middle Belt regions. The State secretary of PDP, Chief Godspower Keku, in a statement on Friday in Yenagoa, also condemned the “despicable display of disrespect” for the person of Ijaw National Leader, Pa Edwin Clark and other elder statesmen and leaders in the South South and Middle Belt regions by the leaders of APC in the state. Keku also berated a comment by the State Publicity Secretary of APC, Mr Diofie Buokoribo for casting aspersions on the integrity of Pa Clark and other leaders in the regions, regarding their views about the election-related violence in Rivers and Bayelsa states. He said that it was as immoral and sickening for a son of the South South to make such a disparaging remarks about the elders and leaders of his people for saying the truth about issues of grave concern to them. According to him, the statement attributed to Buokoribo, where he described Pa Clark and other leaders as a disgrace, fits perfectly into APC’s language of desperation and culture of violence in Bayelsa. He advised the state APC, led by Chief Timipre Sylva and Senator Heineken Lokpobiri to apologize to the people. He stressed that in spite of the massive deployment of soldiers to aid the evil plot of the APC to rig the election in Bayelsa, the people roundly rejected them with the PDP clinching 17 out of the 21 declared results of the 24 House of Assembly seats.
