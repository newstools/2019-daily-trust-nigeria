The APC governorship candidate in Enugu State, Senator Ayogu Eze, has said the man allegedly killed by police during last Saturday’s election was one of his supporters and not an election observer as being insinuated. Sen. Eze said the police officer who fired the tragic shot had also been arrested and handed over to law enforcement agents currently handling the matter in accordance with the service rules. The police in Enugu had confirmed that an unknown man believed to be a domestic observer was shot meters away from the home of Senator Eze on Saturday. But a statement issued by Sen. Ayogu Eze Governorship Campaign Organisation and signed by the APC governorship candidate’s media aide, Clinton Umeh, said its attention was drawn to false stories making the rounds that an observer was shot in its principal’s premises while he was in the village for the governorship and state assembly elections. The true story, according to the statement, is that “No observer was killed in our principal’s house or anywhere near it. What is circulating in the social media is pure fake news, obviously fabricated by those who sent the team to the house of the governorship candidate. “We see this fake story as part of the coordinated assault on the democratic rights of our principal, who has remained calm in the face of severe provocation. Meanwhile, Sen. Eze has pledged to take care of the four children of his young supporter killed while protesting the intrusion into his home by some people claiming to be observers for Saturday’s election. Sen. Eze, who made the promise when he paid a condolence visit to the family of the deceased, assured them that everything would be done to ensure that the four children left behind by the slain supporter would not suffer on account of their father’s untimely death.
