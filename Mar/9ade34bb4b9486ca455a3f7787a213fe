The governorship supplementary election scheduled for 23 March may not hold in Adamawa state as the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) awaits court decision expected on Thursday. The INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner in Adamawa,  Barrister Kassim Gaidam, told journalists that although all preparation for the election had been concluded, the ruling expected on Thursday would determine whether the election would hold or not. The commissioner had earlier indicated that court lacked the powers to stop the commission from conduction elections, citing relevant sections of the Electoral Act. Justice Abdul-Azeez Waziri of the state High Court in Yola had on March 14 issued an order asking INEC to suspend the election processes pending hearing of motion on notice. The request was made by the candidate of Movement for Restoration and Defence of Democracy (MRDD), Eric Theman, who alleged that the logo of his party was excluded on the ballot paper. “As a law abiding institution, we will respect the ruling of the court on the supplementary election,” the commissioner said in what looked like a shift from his earlier position. He noted that INEC headquarters had sent a team of senior lawyers to defend the commission at the court hearing billed for tomorrow.
