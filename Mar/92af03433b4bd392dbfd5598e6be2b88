The Chairman of Kuje area council, Alhaji Abdullahi D. Galadima, has said he does not have to rig to win the rerun chairmanship election slated for Saturday in the area. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had declared elections inconclusive in Rubochi, Kwaku and Kabi wards citing violence and non-use of card readers in the affected polling units. Galadima, while addressing newsmen in Kuje, yesterday, said modalities were put in place by the electoral umpire to make it difficult for any candidate  to rig election. According  to him,  the era of  thuggery in the country’s political process and other political manipulation was over, even as he also kicked against vote buying in an election. “It is on this note that I want to call on people of Kuje area council that they should remain calm and be law-abiding as rigging is not part of the rerun election because with the modalities put in place by INEC, I don’t think any politician will attempt to rig  the elections,” he said. The chairman, therefore, called on the entire residents of the council to conduct themselves peacefully. Galadima of the APC will slug it out with the PDP chairmanship candidate,  Abdullahi Sabo,  who is said to be ahead of  the incumbent chairman with 2, 702 votes.  18,893 PVCs yet to be collected in Kuje — INEC Rerun polls hold in Bwari, Kuje, Kwali March 23 …Bwari, Kuje, Kwali polls declared  inconclusive
