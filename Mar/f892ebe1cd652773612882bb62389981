The All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) has refuted a trending report in the social media that its Nasarawa State governorship candidate, Labaran Maku, had stepped down for the PDP candidate in the state. A release signed by the National Chairman of APGA, Victor Oye, said Maku had not stepped down for the PDP candidate in the state. Oye said the fake news was the handwork of desperate politicians meant to mislead people by blackmailing the APGA candidate in the state to gain advantage. He said there was never a time that Labaran Maku thought about stepping down for the PDP candidate in the state, saying his chances were brighter because he had been endorsed by many groups. He urged the people of Nasarawa State to ignore the report and rally round the APGA candidate at the election.
