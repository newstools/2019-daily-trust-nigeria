The Hausa-Fulani community in Ogun State has endorsed the Allied Peoples Movement (APM) gubernatorial candidate, Adekunle Akinlade ahead of Saturday’s election. It insisted that Akinlade is the most qualified candidate among those contesting the Gubernatorial seat. Speaking at a ceremony organised to endorse Akinlade, the Head of the Hausa-Fulani community in Abeokuta, Alhaji Ibrahim Hassan Hassan said that their decision was informed by the tremendous success recorded by the administration of Governor Ibikunle Amosun, especially in the area of infrastructural development. According to him, the eight years of Amosun’s administration must not be wasted, “we believe Amosun has built a solid foundation for the State and we have faith in Akinlade to carry on in his legacy.” Hassan said: “We know Akinlade is the most qualified candidate among all the candidates contesting for the Governorship seat. We have interacted with the other candidates and we found him (Akinlade) to be the most qualified among them.” “Secondly, all the projects embarked on by Amosun must not stop. We want Akinlade to continue with Amosun’s mission to rebuild Ogun State.” “Amosun’s administration has been generous to us. His government is a government that accommodate all, irrespective of your tribe or religious affiliation and we see Akinlade following his footsteps.” Akinlade in his response, urged the people to vote for him.
