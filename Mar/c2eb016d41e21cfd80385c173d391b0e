The Federal Government, on Monday, commenced training of stakeholders involved in the oil and gas sector on proper metering and measurement in the sector for enhanced national economic development. Director-General of the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON), Mr Osita Aboloma, disclosed this when he declared open a training in metrological measurement in the oil and gas sector at the National Metrology Institute (NMI), Enugu. Represented by Mr Bade Obayi, Director of NMI, Aboloma said the training and its stepping down was necessary given the huge expense of the oil and gas sector particularly in a developing economy like Nigeria. Aboloma said the country depended mainly on the oil and gas sector for a greater percentage of its national income. Earlier, Mrs Crescentia Erukpeme, Zonal Coordinator (South-East) Weights and Measures Department, said there was need for synergy among various agencies and bodies involved in standards in the oil and gas sector.
