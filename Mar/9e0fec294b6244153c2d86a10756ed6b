A Gombe State High Court has sentenced a councillor representing Bolari East in Gombe local government area of Gombe state, to three months imprisonment over vote-buying. The councillor, Ishiyaku Garba, was dragged to the court by Gombe Zonal office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over three-count charge bordering on bribery. The commission told the court that Ishiyaku was arrested by its operatives based on intelligence report and was arrested at Bolari Polling Unit 0077 in Gombe metropolis during the Presidential and National Assembly Elections, where he was arrested while sharing money. EFCC counsel, S.E Okemini said the offence was contrary to Section 124 (5) of Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended) and punishable under Section 124 (1) (c) of the same Act. When asked by the court, the councillor pleaded guilty to the three-count charges. Prosecuting counsel also presented a witness, Hillary Obetta who reviewed the facts and also tender evidence against him which the court admitted as Exhibits 1, 2, 3 and 4. The defence counsel, Barrister S.A. Mustapha, however, pleaded to the court for leniency.
