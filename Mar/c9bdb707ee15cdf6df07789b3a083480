A group under the auspices of  Edo PDP Parliament for Positive Change, has urged the Edo State chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Dan Orbih, to step aside, following the party’s abysmal performance in the state assembly election. A communique signed by its legal adviser, Barr. Davison Osas Davison, and made available to journalists, yesterday in Benin, said the group welcomed party members who were passionate about the PDP to reverse its electoral misfortune. The group voiced its readiness to rescue the PDP in the state from its ‘non-winning election syndrome’ and turn it into a vibrant, inclusive and transparent party capable of winning elections in the state all the times. They called on lovers of democracy and the PDP in Edo to advise Chief Orbih and his cohorts to resign before a vote of no confidence is passed on him soonest. Responding, Chief Orbih, who described the group as faceless, added that no group at the state or national level of the party existed with such name. “They are a faceless group sponsored by the state APC as a payback for the humiliating defeat it suffered in the presidential an National Assembly elections, considering the fact that APC national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, and the state governor, Godwin Obaseki are in the APC. “Party leaders from the 18 local governments of the state are with me because I continue to receive from them congratulatory messages over our performance in the last election. Our priority now is to put measures in place to take over the state government come next year,” Orbih said. 2019 elections: Group wants PDP chairman's resignation following poor outing Edo PDP group demands party chairman's resignation Edo guber challenge: The battles within PDP
