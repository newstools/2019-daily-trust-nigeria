Gov. Willie Obiano of Anambra on Saturday inaugurated a modern fish feed production plant valued at N1.2 billion in Onitsha to boost fish business in the state. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the private plant is owned by Grand Cereals Ltd., a Nigerian integrated foods company that produces and markets consumer food products. The firm, which is a subsidiary of Nigeria’s oldest and versatile conglomerate, UAC of Nigeria Plc., produces Vital Fish Feed brand. Obiano commended the firm, saying the project was an outcome of an earlier engagement between the government and the firm in 2015. The governor, who was represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Prof. Solo Chukwulobelu, said his administration was already partnering with the firm to integrate farmers into the project. “We expect the facility to expand to employ more people and to ensure that the state is self-sufficient in fish production,’’ he said. Obiano said his government would work closely with the company and other manufacturing firms within the Ogbaru Industrial Layout, where the firm is located to solve the problem of power supply. “We are ready for more investors; we will like your Gala factory to come to Anambra because we are looking for investors,’’ he said.
