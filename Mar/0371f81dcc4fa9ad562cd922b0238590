A member of the House of Representatives, Abdulmumin Jibrin (APC, Kano), has said he met with President Muhammadu Buhari over the leadership of the ninth Assembly. Jibrin, who represents Kiru/Bebeji Federal Constituency of Kano State, said he met with the president at the Presidential Villa, Abuja at the weekend. Lawmakers-elect had since begun intense politicking for the four presiding officer positions – Senate president, Speaker, deputy Senate president and deputy Speaker. Speaking to State House reporters after the meeting, Jibrin said: “Of course I met with the Mr President; first to greet him as usual, for all he has done and to congratulate him and to also offer a few advice. “We all know the political issues now as matters related to the election of the leadership of the national assembly.” On what is being done to avoid a repeat of the 2015 scenario, Jibrin said: “The position of our party and our leaders has always been that all elected members and of course, senators, should exercise patience; work is going on, consultations are being carried out and I believe that no any elected senator or members of APC would allow himself to be used by the opposition like in the case of 2015. “In the case of 2015, there weren’t consequences, but I am pretty sure that this time around, if anybody allowed himself to be used by the opposition party, there will certainly be consequences,” he said. On whether APC was considering zoning the position this time around, he said: “Yes, to make things much more easier and to narrow down the contest to a fewer people, the party is expected to bring out a zoning which of course we expect everybody should abide by.” Budget padding: House of Reps crisis deepens Jibrin appears before APC panel Budget Padding Latest: Dogara, Lasun, Doguwa, Jibrin, others in the eye of the storm
