The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) is presently recruiting and expectedly the employed, unemployed and underemployed average Nigerian youth, have filed in their applications. I have spoken to not a few Nigerian youths who have completed their applications on the rather herculean and clumsy (with utmost respect to the creators and managers of the site) application portal, and the general view seems to be the same.  Roughly translated, the average view of the average Nigerian youth about the recruitment process seems to go thus: ‘men, am just doing this for doing sake o. Do I have the connection to land an NNPC job? I mean the politicians; their families and friends have all allocated the jobs to themselves and children even before the advert was made’. While this might have been the case before the coming on board of Mr Buhari as President and substantive minister of the petroleum ministry, I dare say, that my confidence is rock-solid that the president’s integrity and cognate antecedent in the industry are enough to exterminate the nepotism and corruption that have hitherto characterised NNPC recruitments. Thus, I call on the president, who is also chairman of the NNPC board of which both the GMD and Minister of State are members, to ensure that the integrity, transparency and accountability of the process is held high up to the extent that all Nigerian youths, including  my humble self, who have faithfully filed in our applications to contributing our quota towards the realisation of the vision of the NNPC, will be given an equal playing field and have every reason to once again believe in this country and indeed re-consolidate our believe in the integrity and unimpeachable character of Mr President on whose table the buck stops in this regard. I believe I have spoken the mind of the average, hapless, qualified but unemployed average Nigerian youth on the street. It is up to you sir, Your Excellency, Mr President.
