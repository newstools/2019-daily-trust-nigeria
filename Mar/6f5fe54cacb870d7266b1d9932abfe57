A coalition of 33 political parties and as 20 governorship candidates in Bauchi State has vowed to support Senator Bala Mohammed of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) against Governor Mohammed Abubakar of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Saturday’s governorship election. Leader of the coalition and an elder statesman, Muhammadu Kirfi, disclosed this, yesterday, at a meeting held at Riveredge Hotel, Bauchi, saying the move was part of their renewed efforts to unseat Governor Abubakar. According to him, the parties decided to adopt the PDP candidate because “he has the courage and wherewithal to defeat Governor Abubakar.” “I urge the people of Bauchi State and the stakeholders to support Senator Bala Mohammed,” he said. Kirfi noted that although the people of Bauchi State had a lot of confidence and respect for President Muhammad Buhari, which was why they voted for him, they were not happy with happenings in the state under Governor Abubakar. In his reaction, the Press Secretary to Bauchi State governor, Abubakar Al-Sadiqque, urged the people to vote wisely in Saturday’s election as they did in 2015. “We are not afraid of any coalition because we believe in Allah who gives power to whom he wishes as He will give it again to Governor Abubakar,” he said. Some of the political parties in the coalition include Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the United Progressive Party (UPP), Green Party of Nigeria (GPN), Change Advocacy Party (CAP), All Peoples Movement (APM), Advance Peoples Democratic Alliance (APDA), Grassroots Development Party of Nigeria (GDPN), Accord Party (AP), among others.
