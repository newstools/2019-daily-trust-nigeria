Oil workers under the auspices of Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) and Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) have urged President Muhammadu Buhari not to renege on his determined efforts to diversify the nation’s economy and optimally rehabilitate the four refineries. In a congratulatory message to the president on his re-election jointly signed by the two unions and made available to Daily Trust in Lagos at the weekend, the workers also stressed that the two unions will not renege in continuing to cooperate and work assiduously with the administration of President Buhari’s government in his second term. The unions hope that the positive trends that were observed during the election would be sustained and further improved during future elections for an enduring political stability of the country.
