The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Kano has warned the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to declare its gubernatorial candidate winner of the Saturday’s election for peace to reign in the state. Chairman of the party in the state, Dr Rabi’u Sulaiman Bichi, sounded the warning on Monday at the INEC headquarters, Kano. Bichi said: “It is evident that after collating the results of 43 local governments, PDP is leading in the state but unfortunately, some thugs went to the Nassarawa local government collation center and disrupted the collation and tore the results sheet. “We are calling on the INEC to declare PDP winner for the results that have been collated and later the only one ward that remains will be collated. “Anything short of this may lead to something else in Kano. For peace to reign in Kano, INEC should simply declare PDP winner of the Kano state gubernatorial poll.” Winner of Kano State governorship election will be declared today - REC Abacha: A cat with nine lives?
