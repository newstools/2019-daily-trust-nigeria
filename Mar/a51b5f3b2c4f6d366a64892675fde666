The PDP factional executives in Kano State led by Sen. Mas’ud El-Jibril Doguwa have defected to the APC, hours after a Federal High Court in Kano nullified PDP’s primary elections. Addressing a press conference, yesterday, Sen. Doguwa said, “Our decision to leave PDP at this critical time is painful but necessary. “For over 40 years I spent in politics…I have never changed political party; but because of the lingering internal crisis, we find it very difficult to remain in PDP because there is no unity and harmonious working relationship in the party. “The national leadership of the PDP has destroyed the party in Kano. Under Secondus, PDP is in disaster and will remain in it inasmuch as he remains its national chairman. The party is in serious problem at all levels in Kano,” he said. Sen. Doguwa said the just concluded presidential election had vindicated former Kano State governor, Malam Ibrahim Shekarau, who had called for fairness and justice in the party’s activities before he defected to APC. “The national leadership of the party ignored Shekarau because it is the game plan of Secondus to chase away every popular politician from the party for his personal interest. With the popularity of Shekarau, the APC would have nowhere to go in Kano, the party frustrated him until he dumped it unceremoniously,” he lamented. The former PDP chairman said the defectors would work hand-in-hand with Governor Abdullahi Ganduje to ensure his success in the forthcoming gubernatorial election. “Engr. Abba Kabir Yusuf (embattled gubernatorial candidate) has never called to seek for my assistance. His boss, Sen. Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso did not also seek for my advice, but Ganduje has respect for every politician irrespective of party affiliation,” he said.
