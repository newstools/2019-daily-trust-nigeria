Meanwhile, Rivers women, yesterday in Port Harcourt, joined the ranks of civil society groups that are asking INEC to redeploy the state Resident Electoral Commissioner, Obo Effanga or risk a complete shut-down of the entire state. The women who marched through the streets of the capital to the INEC state office along the Port Harcourt-Aba Expressway identified the actions of the REC as the major source of tension in the elections in the state. Spokeswoman for the female protesters, Mrs. Ngozi Amadi said, “We have watched with dismay the unfolding drama in our dear state and have decided that as mothers we cannot afford to continue to watch and pray while things go wrong. “On behalf of Rivers women, we have marched out in our thousands to cry to God and man in protest over the obvious plan to force fabricated election results on us and precipitate crisis in our dear state,” she said.
