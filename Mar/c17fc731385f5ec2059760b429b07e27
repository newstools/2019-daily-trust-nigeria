The coalition of INEC-accredited observers for the 2019 governorship election in Bauchi State has faulted the electoral umpire over its decision not to conduct a rerun election in Tafawa Balewa local government area of Bauchi state. This was disclosed by the Secretary of the coalition, Comrade Peter Nwokolo at a press briefing in Bauchi. According to the coalition, conducting a rerun election would be more acceptable to all the parties and would prevent unnecessary legal tussles between the parties. The coalition lamented that many irregularities were recorded across the country during the 2019 general elections. It noted that the rampant irregularities gave rise to widespread discontentment in the country. “There is almost general disillusionment among the masses that, probably, INEC under Professor Mahmood Yakubu, could not very well handle the 2019 general elections. “As it stands now, there is fear that certain unscrupulous elements in Bauchi state and elsewhere could seize the opportunity of this seeming electoral lacuna to engage in hooliganism and wanton disorder in the state,” he feared. The coalition of election observers therefore advised INEC to maintain its earlier position of cancelling the elections in Tafawa Balewa local government area and go ahead to conclude plans on the rerun election scheduled for 23rd March 2019.
