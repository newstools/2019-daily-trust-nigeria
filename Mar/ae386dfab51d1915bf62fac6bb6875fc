A Kaduna State High Court has adjourned the trial of the leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), also known as Shiite, Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky and his wife, Zeenat, indefinitely following the appointment of the presiding judge, Justice Gideon Kurada to serve as judge in the Presidential and National Assembly Elections Petitions Tribunal in Yobe. Speaking to newsmen shortly after the adjournment, Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) and lead counsel to the defendants, Femi Falana said aside the absence of the trial Judge, his clients (El-Zakzaky and wife Zeenat), were in dire need of medical attention and that was why they could not appear in court. Falana said his clients have not been given adequate medical care since 14th December, 2015 when they were detained. According to him: “The court has adjourned ‘Sine die’, meaning indefinitely. My clients are yet to access any form of medical attention even after the court had ordered so. The case has to be adjourned as both my clients need time to attend to their health.” It would be recalled that Zakzaky and his wife are standing trial over allegations of culpable homicide, unlawful assembly, and disruption of public peace, among others.
