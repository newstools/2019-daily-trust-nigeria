The Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC) has said that the Financial Transparency Coalition’s report that developing countries lose a whopping $1trn to illicit financial flows, annually, through companies with hidden ownership, should not be taken for granted. The Executive Director of CISLAC, Auwal Musa Rafsanjani, said this yesterday in Abuja at the Anti-Money Laundry (AML) Tracker launch/Second AML stakeholders’ conference. The event was organised by the CISLAC, European Union (EU) and Transparency International (TI). This is as the centre also said Nigeria has become a synonym for ‘fantastic levels of corruption’ and monumental graft, despite that in 2018 it recorded 87 million of its citizens out of it 200 million strong population as living on a little more than $1 a day. Rafsanjani, who is also the Head of TI in Nigeria, and represented by the CISLAC Legal Adviser, Barrister Adeshina Oke, said that was the first time for such very high number of people living in extreme poverty to be recorded.
