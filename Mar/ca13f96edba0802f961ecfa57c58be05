Feedbackhall, a social media and consumer networking service based in Abuja, has called on regulatory agencies and online platforms to protect the consumer and enhance confidence in their products. This was stated on Friday at a press briefing to mark the 2019 World Consumer Rights Day with the theme-Trusted Smart Products, organised by the networking service, Feedbackhall. Director of the service, Mani Ibrahim Ahmad Ph.D said although the Consumer Protection Council (CPC) was doing a lot in ensuring that consumers’ rights were protected, consumers themselves must ensure they create the change they want to see in ensuring improved service from the service providers by creating a community and calling them out on Social Media. It said that consumers distrust of e-commerce platforms could be minimal if companies focus on their feedback mechanism and make targeted improvements not only for the satisfaction of customers but also for their own sustainable growth and over all benefit of society. Mani noted that a survey by his organisation showed that Nigerians have expressed their lack of trust in digital products while many indicated interest in buying physically than buying online. He further said many were unwilling to input their ATM card details into online payment platforms because a large number of them have confirmed to have been duped online.
