The Emir of Kano, Malam Muhammadu Sanusi II, yesterday organised special prayers for Governor Abdullahi Ganduje’s second term. The prayer session, held at the Kano Central Mosque, was attended by all the district heads, chief imam of Kano, Islamic scholars and top government officials. This was contained in a statement signed by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor on Media, Alhaji Abba Anwar. In his remarks, Emir Sanusi harped on forgiveness, saying, “misunderstanding is sometime caused by sycophants. It is therefore necessary for us to always pray for Allah’s protection from such elements. “It is not bad for anyone to hold on to his or her opinion about happenings in the society. But what is paramount is the fact that after election, all people should come together and see to the successful tenure of the government in power. “Ganduje’s administration deserves all necessary support and cooperation for the development of our dear state. We must all come together and make Kano greater. We must work hard and pray incessantly for the development of our state and the nation in general.” Shun vindictiveness — Ganduje urged The last hours of Emir of Kano Ado Bayero The siege on Kano must end
