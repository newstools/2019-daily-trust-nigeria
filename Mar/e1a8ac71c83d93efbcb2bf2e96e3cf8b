A Federal High Court in Abuja has vacated the order stopping the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC from collating Tafawa Balewa Local Government Area election results for the Bauchi Governorship election. The court also declined jurisdiction on the matter at the resumed hearing on Monday. Recall thatÂ Justice Inyang Ekwo made the order halting the collation on Tuesday following an ex parte application filed by the All Progressives Congress, APC and the incumbent governor of the state, Mohammed Abubakar. The judge granted an interim injunction restraining INEC from resuming, concluding and announcing the governorship election result in Bauchi State, pending the determination of all issues raised by the APC and Gov. Abubakar in their originating summons.
