Igbo traders in Edo State have pledged to give massive votes to the All Progressives Congress (APC)’s candidates in the March 9, State House of Assembly election. According to them, their support for APC candidates in the election will ensure continuity of ongoing economic reforms being implemented by Governor Godwin Obaseki. Leader of the Igbo traders, Chief Ejike Enemuo, gave the assurance in Benin during a meeting between the traders and Governor Obaseki at Government House, in Benin. He said Igbo traders were beneficiaries of several economic reforms initiated by the APC-led government in the state, particularly the ban on illegal tax collection across markets in the state as well as cut in revenue paid by them. “We are here to pledge our unflinching loyalty and support to you and your government. We have started sensitising and mobilising our co-traders and their families to come out en masse to vote for the continuity of your good policies,” he said. Responding, Obaseki commended the traders for supporting his administration, adding that he was committed to building on the business-friendly environment in the state so that traders will continue to do their business unhindered.
