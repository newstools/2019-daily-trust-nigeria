The Venezuelan Ambassador to Nigeria, His Excellency David Nieves Velásquez Caraballo, has promised to provide technical support to rice farmers across five states in the country. He made this known during a medical outreach programme organized by the embassy at the Hugo Chavez Primary School in Jankanwa, Nasarawa State yesterday. The outreach was organized alongside six medical doctors, who were among the 16 beneficiaries of the Venezuelan scholarship. “Three years ago, President Nicolas Maduro made a $5million donation to provide technical support to rice farmers in 10 African countries. The scholarship programmes, this school and the agricultural projects are all in solidarity with our relationship with Nigeria,” he said.
