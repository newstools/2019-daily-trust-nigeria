Thirty-one candidates are on the ballot contesting for the governorship seat  in the March 9 Governorship and State Assembly election in Niger state. Also 371 candidates would contest for the 27 seats in the State House of Assembly in the Saturday polls. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)’s Resident Electoral Commissioner for the state, Professor Sam Egwu disclosed this during a press briefing preparatory to the Saturday polls  in Minna. Professor Egwu said INEC in the state was ready for the elections, adding that all sensitive materials are with the Central Bank of Nigeria office in the state capital and ready to be deployed across all the 25 local government areas of the state. According to him, the governorship and state House of Assembly polls would be more competitive than the earlier one because it is a localized exercise. “There is the likelihood of high turnout of voters this time around because the electorate know the candidates and will come out to support them,” he explained. He said that the Commission anticipated this and has marshalled out plans on how to overcome any possible challenges that may arise during the exercise. He also said the Commission has also reviewed the conduct of the last Presidential and National Assembly election and hiccups experienced with a view to improving on the exercise. He warned communities which resisted the use of Card Readers during the last election to desist from repeating same, adding “where there is resistance, such elections will be cancel”. He said people resisted the use of Card Readers due to the myth that the machine works only where there is network, noting that such position is mere fallacy as the functionality of Card readers is not in anyway tied to network.  2015 Political Events in Retrospective 19 and 20 49 females to contest in Niger
