The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has released global passenger traffic results for January 2019 showing traffic (revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs) rose 6.5% compared to January 2018. This was the fastest growth in six months. January capacity (available seat kilometers or ASKs) rose 6.4%, and load factor inched up 0.1 percentage point to 79.6%. January 2019 was also positive for African carriers as traffic rose 5.1%, up from 3.8% in December. This is just as the NCAA figures of 2018 flight operations showed a growth of about five per cent compared to the 2017 chart. However, IATA noted that concerns continue about the region’s largest economies, South Africa and Nigeria. The region’s capacity rose 2.9%, and load factor jumped 1.5 percentage points to 70.9%. IATA’s Director General and CEO, Alexandre de Juniac, commenting on the result said, “2019 has started on a positive note, with healthy passenger demand in line with the 10-year trend line.” Meanwhile, the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has said that nine domestic airlines operated 59,818 flights while 34 airlines on the international routes operated 15,645 flights from January to December 2018.
