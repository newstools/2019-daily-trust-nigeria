Former fighters of the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) in Ethiopia have gone on a hunger strike at a military camp where they have been staying since laying down their arms following a peace deal with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s government. The fighters said they were subjected to “poor living conditions” at Tolay camp in south-western Ethiopia, and promises that they would be given to training to build a new life have failed to materialise. “We are being treated inhumanly and no one cares about us,” an ex-fighter said. “Most of our comrades are now ill due to lack of hygiene and absence of food,” he added.
