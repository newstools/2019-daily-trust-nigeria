The president of the Kaduna Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture, Dr. Muheeba F. Dankaba, has said that President Muhammadu Buhari is expected to declare open the 40th Kaduna International Trade Fair. Dankaba, who made this known when she led other members of the chamber on a courtesy call to the head office of Daily Trust newspapers in Abuja, said more than 70 local and international exhibits are expected at this year’s event. She said the 10-day event will start on Friday, March 29 but the official opening ceremony will be performed by President Muhammadu Buhari on Saturday, March 30 while the governor of Kaduna State, Malam Nasir el-Rufai, is expected as a special guest of honour. She said the fair’s theme, ‘Consolidating Interface Between Industry and Agriculture for Nigeria’s Sustainable Development’, was chosen to complement the effort of the government towards reviving the economy to attract investment in agriculture, manufacturing and other sectors. Dankaba said among the flagship events lined up to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the international trade fair is a quiz competition among senior secondary school students from the 19 northern states and a business roundtable. While calling for partnership with Daily Trust in ensuring the success of the fair, she said over 70 exhibitors including investors from India, Pakistan, Thailand, and other countries are expected at the international trade fair. Responding, Daily Trust’s General Manager, Business and Strategy, Ahmed Shekarau, assured the team of the support and contribution of the organisation to ensure proper coverage and success of the event. “We will try to do much more than the routine thing we used to do,” he said.
