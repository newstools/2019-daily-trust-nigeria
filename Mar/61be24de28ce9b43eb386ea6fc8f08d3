Youths of Niger Delta region have said that the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari during the February 23, 2019 presidential was divinely ordained by God for the total transformation of the country. The youths under the auspices of Niger Delta Youth Movement (NDDC), after its national executive council meeting in Yenagoa on Monday, told Journalists that the selling point for President Buhari was his uncompromising integrity. The spokesman for the group, Mr Gospel Werenepre, also urged the youths of the region to shun violence and thuggery during and after the election, but rather availed themselves of the opportunities provided by the acting Managing Director of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Professor Nelson Brambiafa in various sectors of empowerment and skill acquisition. He noted that with the vision of the NDDC boss to bring development to the Niger Delta, the youths of the region have resolved to work with the Federal Government to attract developmental programmes which will help sway youths away from sinister activities.
