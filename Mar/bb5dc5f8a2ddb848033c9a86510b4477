In the bid to boost Nigeria’s industrialization process, the Federal Government has inaugurated the National Steering Committee to implement Leather Products Policy in the country. Speaking at the inauguration ceremony on Tuesday  in Abuja, the Minister of Science and Technology, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, advised Nigerians to take advantage of the low cost of labour and invest in the leather industry. Dr Onu said all efforts would be deployed to ensure effective implementation of the policy, adding that past efforts at industrialization failed because “we didn’t do first thing first.” He added that the widely acclaimed Moroccan leather products were actually sourced from Nigeria Dr Onu said the leather industry is very critical to national growth and development because it will boost our Gross Development Product (GDP) and increase our foreign exchange earnings. He said the policy will solve most of the problems hindering the growth of the leather sector and will enable Nigeria to produce shoes, belts and other leather products similar to what is obtained in other developed countries of the world. The committee is expected to set up working plan and budget for the effective implementation of the policy within two months.
