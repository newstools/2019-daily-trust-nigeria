The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has rejected PDP’s accusation that it has denied its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, access to election materials as ordered by a court. The Chief Press Secretary to the chairman of the commission, Mr Rotimi Oyekanmi, told Daily Trust that INEC has a good record of obeying court orders. He said, if and when the commission receives the orders of the court, it will comply. “However, it is common knowledge that since the declaration of the results of the presidential election, the commission has been very busy with the multiple activities regarding the National Assembly, governorship, State Houses of Assembly and FCT elections. “Only last Thursday, the commission presented Certificates of Return to senators-elect and House of Representatives members-elect including PDP members,” Oyekanmi said. He said it is clear that the commission has been fully engaged with hardly any breathing space, adding that he was not sure INEC was in receipt of the letter the PDP claims it has sent. He said, “But let me also say this. The PDP needs to show some decorum in the way it composes its press statements. The INEC chairman and commission members deserve some respect. The PDP’s frequent use of offensive and abusive words, which secondary school students get to read very often is unhelpful.” He said it is advisable for every political party to show good examples and a deep sense of responsibility in the way it composes statements for public consumption.
