The acting Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mohammed Adamu has ordered a speedy investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of late Ogar Jumbo, an Assistant Superintendent of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC). A statement yesterday from police spokesman, ACP Frank Mba, said while condoling with the family, the Commandant General of the NSCDC, friends and professional colleagues of the deceased, the IGP reassured them that everything humanly possible will be done to ensure that justice prevails in the case. Mba said, “the IGP enjoins that the NSCDC along with the family of the deceased, may, for the purpose of transparency, nominate any medical doctor of their choice to witness the autopsy, at the appropriate time and venue.” He added that, “needless to state that an autopsy, which is a comprehensive forensic examination on the body of a dead person, will help the investigators to have a definitive understanding of the real cause of death of the deceased.” The IGP also called for calm from the family and friends of the deceased and the entire public, reiterating that the case will not be swept under the carpet.
