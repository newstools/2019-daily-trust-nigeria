Skyway Aviation Handling Company PLC (SAHCO) and ABX World and Agro-allied solutions have formed a strategic partnership to facilitate transportation of farm products in Nigeria to buyers across the world. SAHCO stated that it has invested heavily in storage facilities and logistic support such that Nigerian farmers would have a hitch-free export opportunity in the country. The Managing Director/CEO of SAHCO PLC, Mr. Basil Agboarumi, who stated this during a meeting with ABX World and Agro Allied solutions team, said “SAHCO PLC has one of the best warehouses in Africa and the best in West Africa.” “SAHCO has invested so much on equipment. In cargo, we have just commissioned the purchase of new scanning machines. Also, we just acquired state-of-the-art high loader (LAM35) which has the capacity to load and offload up to 40 tons at a go,’’ said Agboarumi. Head of Cargo Services, SAHCO PLC, Mr. Jide Kafidipe noted that 75% of agricultural produce goes to waste, noting that SAHCO storage  facility is capable of handling 16 to 35 aircraft pallets and SAHCO PLC is also planning to invest in packaging especially of perishable goods Earlier, the MD/CEO ABX World and Agro Allied Solutions, Captain John Okakpu, said Nigeria has over 12 products that are of export value and the meeting was to look for ways to move the country forward instead of relying on oil. “In US and Europe, the agencies are not as numerous, and the process is not as cumbersome. It takes an average of 72 hours to do documentations here in Nigeria after which the produce must have gone bad,’’ he stated.
