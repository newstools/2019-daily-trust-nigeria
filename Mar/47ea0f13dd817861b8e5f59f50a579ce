The Court of Appeal sitting in Jalingo has ordered a stay of execution on the disqualification of the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Taraba State,  Sani Danladi. Justice Chidi Uwa gave the order yesterday, a day after the Federal High Court in Jalingo disqualified Mr Danladi from participating in the coming governorship election in the state. He stayed the execution of the order of the lower court following a motion ex-parte filed by  Danladi and the APC. The judge asked  Usman Udi and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), as well as others listed as the respondents to maintain status quo, pending the determination of the motion on notice filed by the applicants yesterday. He also issued an interim injunction restraining the respondents from taking further steps towards the execution of the judgement of the lower court.
