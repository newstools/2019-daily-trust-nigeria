The All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker Committee in Ogun state has warned commercial banks and other financial institutions against granting loans to Governor Ibikunle Amosun barely two months to expiration of his term. A statement issued on Monday in Abeokuta by the spokesman of the committee, Tunde Oladunjoye, said  any institution that grants such requests “does so at its own risk”. The statement reads: “It has come to our notice that the outgoing governor has been exerting pressures on banks and financial institutions to grant frivolous loans, overdrafts and other instruments immediately Prince Dapo Abiodun was declared Governor-Elect. “We are equally aware that files and other sensitive government documents are being moved out of government offices on the order of the outgoing Governor, His Excellency, Senator Ibikunle Amosun. “It is therefore important to let it be known to the concerned public officers that it is part of their duties to protect public properties, including files, documents and information at their disposal, as anything contrary to this will be running foul of the laws and their oath of office. The allegiance of the civil servants is to Ogun state and not to any individual, no matter who. “As for the banks, we want to state categorically that the incoming administration believes so much in the rule of law and due process. Therefore, the administration will not honour any obligation that did not follow due process or any loans that did not receive the prior approval of the State House of Assembly.” Amosun seeks assembly’s approval to access N65.7bn loan Ogun APC slams Amosun, says he deserves sympathy We must rescue Ogun workers from Amosun — NLC President
