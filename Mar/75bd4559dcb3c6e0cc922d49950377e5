A right-wing party in Australia discussed softening the nation’s strict gun laws as it sought donations from a US lobby group in a bid for greater political power, video recordings show. Representatives from One Nation, an anti-Islam minor party, met with the National Rifle Association last year. Australian PM Scott Morrison says the videos, secretly filmed by Al Jazeera, showed “deeply concerning” discussions. The representatives say they had been drinking when they were recorded. On Tuesday Mr Morrison asserted that Australia’s gun laws were the “world’s best”, adding “we will not be changing them”. It comes in the aftermath of the killings of 50 Muslims in shooting attacks on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern referenced Australia’s gun law reforms – swiftly introduced after a 1996 massacre – before announcing her own crackdown last week.
