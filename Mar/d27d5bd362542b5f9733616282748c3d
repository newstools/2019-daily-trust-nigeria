President Muhammadu Buhari has said that his decision to observe Juma’at prayers at the Presidential Villa and not the National Mosque, Abuja, was to prevent the constraints and inconveniences presidential movements may cause to the people. Buhari was responding to a request by a delegation of Imams and Senior Islamic Scholars from all States of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory led by Prof. Shehu Ahmad Galadanci, the Murshid, National Mosque. “Regarding your request for me to be attending Juma’at prayers in the National Mosque, I implore you to note that I personally started observing Juma’at prayers in the State House in order to reduce hardships which people may pass through. “As you all know, Presidential movements require roadblocks and other attendant restrictions which could subject worshippers and other people to a lot of difficulties,” the President told the Islamic scholars who were at State House to congratulate him on his victory at the February 23 presidential election. President Buhari welcomed the counsel of the Islamic scholars on the teachings of the Prophet about the obligations of leaders towards their subjects, and vice-versa. The President thanked them for their prayers and support for his administration, assuring that the administration will leave no stone unturned in addressing the security challenges facing the country.
