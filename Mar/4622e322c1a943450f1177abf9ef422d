The ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, has accused the Kano State Police Commissioner, Muhammad Wakili of actively assisting the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to rig the governorship election in Kano state. The APC National Publicity Secretary, Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, said in a statement issued on Sunday in Abuja that the Police Commissioner withdrew Kano state commissioner’s orderlies.

He added that Kano remains an APC state and that the party is confident of winning the supplementary election in the state. “The APC’s visible achievements in Kano state under Governor Abdullahi Ganduje are enough to give the party an emphatic victory in the rerun election. Again, the rerun will be mostly in APC-controlled rural areas and Nasarawa local government area where our Deputy Governor, Nasiru Yusuf Gawuna is from. Undoubtedly, Kano state remains an APC stronghold and remains in our firm control,” Issa-Onilu added. ‘Singham’: The Story of Nigeria’s Super CP Wakili  has been described as the hero of 2019 general elections as policemen under his watch arrested the Deputy Governor of Kano State, Dr Nasiru Yusuf Gawuna, Commissioner for Local Government, Alhaji Murtala Sule Garo and chairman of Nassarawa Local Government, Alhaji Lamin Sani, for allegedly destroying result sheets during the collation of local government results for the governorship and state Assembly elections in Kano.
