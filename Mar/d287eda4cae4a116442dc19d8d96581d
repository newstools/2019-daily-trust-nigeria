The senator representing Borno South, Mohammed Ali Ndume, has formally declared his intention to contest for the office of Senate president in the incoming 9th National Assembly. Ndume, a former Senate leader, said in a letter addressed to the National Chairman of APC Adams Oshiomhole, yesterday, that his resolve to contest for the Number 3 citizen’s office was due to his zeal to contribute to Nigeria’s socioeconomic development. He said he believed that APC as a party would zone the position to the North East zone, considering the contributions of the region to the party’s electoral victory during the polls. “Following the successful conduct of the 2019 general elections and the overwhelming victory of our great party, the APC at all levels, I hereby forward my letter of intent to contest for the office of the President of the Senate in the 9th National Assembly,” the letter read in part. “I wish to emphasise that my decision to contest for the Senate presidency is informed by my conviction to contribute my quota to nation building,” Ndume also said in the letter. He said his “vast legislative experience and deep desire to take Nigeria to the next level of development” were some of the reasons for his decision to contest.”  Borno leaders want Ndume as Senate president Race for NASS Leadership Hots Up Senate presidency: How not to canvass for senators votes
