The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has been described as an institution that promotes thuggery in the name of democracy. A former Commissioner of Land under the regime of Senator Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso, Alhaji Yusuf Bello Dambatta, made the statement on Sunday while commenting on the outcome of the just concluded rerun in Kano state. Dambatta, who made the comment at INEC collation centre, alleged that there was no election in Gama and some other places slated for the rerun poll. “It is unfortunate that INEC in Kano is promoting thuggery in the state instead of democracy. “Voters were chased away from the polling units and denied rights to vote,” he said. Reacting to the allegation, the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Riskuwa Arabu Shehu, debunked the allegation, saying INEC was not established to promote violence. Shehu said the commission going by its guidelines had provisions in its Act that spelt out how the commission would manage violence. “So, it is not true that INEC is promoting violence. The commission is ready to accept correction. I am appealing to us to let us be as democratic as possible in expressing our views. “I am appealing with us to try to understand each other and make our comments with clear sincerity so that we can progress,” he said.
