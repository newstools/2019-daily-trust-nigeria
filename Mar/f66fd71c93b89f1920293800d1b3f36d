The Presidential Support Committee, PSC, South East Zone, has given the Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, 48 hours to lift the suspension of the Governor of Imo State, Owelle Rochas Okorocha, from the party. The committee also made a case for senate presidency from the South East in view of the enormous support and the votes garnered by President Muhammadu Buhari from the zone in the February 23 presidential election. At a press briefing in Owerri on their assessment of the presidential and National Assembly election, the committee noted that suspending a key stakeholder and major financier of the party, like Okorocha, did not speak well of the NWC and threatened to embark on legal and mass action if the suspension was not lifted. The conference was jointly addressed by the Director of Inter-Party Affairs, South East; Robert Ngwu, National Legal Adviser; Ejikeme Ugwu and Director, Political Matters; Comrade Maxwel Okoye. The committee said that the whole plan was an orchestrated agenda to deny the Igbo presidency in 2023, knowing that Okorocha is one of the major contenders. The committee said: “Okorocha’s suspension came to us as a rude shock. There is no way a cabal can suspend a major financier of the party. We give the NWC and the national chairman 48 hours to reverse the suspension without delay else, we will resort to legal and mass action against the leadership of APC. “The suspension is aimed at disorganising Igbo ahead of 2023. Oshiomhole cannot wake up and suspend a major financier of the party. We plead with Buhari not to allow some few individuals to rubbish his friends because we know that Okorocha is a good friend of the president.” APC suspends Okorocha, Amosun, others for ‘anti-party activities’ Apprehension as Buhari visits Imo Tuesday Senate: Okorocha, Izunaso, Uwajumogu  make INEC provisional list
