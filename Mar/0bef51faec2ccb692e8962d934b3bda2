Kano state governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, has said the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Abba Kabir Yusuf, and his supporters will receive the shocker of their lives in the scheduled rerun governorship election in the state. Ganduje said he was unperturbed by the wishful thinking and slapdash deportment of the PDP candidate considering what happened in the inconclusive election widely characterized by alleged vote buying and voter’s intimidation by the party. The chairman, Publicity committee of the APC for 2019 Election, Malam Muhammad Garba in a statement on Tuesday that the APC and its candidate remained upbeat and sure of victory as Kano remained an APC state. He said while Ganduje remain committed to the conduct of free and fair election, all loopholes that gave them chance of rigging, vote buying and intimidation of voters had been blocked. “APC as a party has also re-strategized and very confident of victory because the local government areas where the rerun will take place remain the APC stronghold  and the electorate in these areas have made up their mind to vote massively for the governor they trust,” he said. Garba, who is the state’s commissioner of Information, said APC do not believe in campaign of calumny but on issues that pertain to the development of Kano state which endeared him into the minds of the people. “The modest achievements recorded so far by the Ganduje Administration have touched the lives of the people in all sectors of development and also remain determined to continue if returned,’’ the commissioner added.
