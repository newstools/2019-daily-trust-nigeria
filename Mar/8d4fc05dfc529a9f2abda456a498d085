The State Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Alhaji Abdullahi Abbas has said there were no grounds for the cancellation of the rerun election currently going on in the state. The opposition party in Kano, Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, had earlier called for the immediate cancellation of the exercise as a result of some irregularities. But the APC in the state denied all the allegations raised by the PDP chairman, saying the allegations were unfounded. Abbas said: “The call by the PDP for cancellation of election was uncalled-for because the election is still ongoing. “INEC should ensure conclusion of the election. “PDP should wait for the final result of the poll and then take legal action if not satisfied with it. That is what the law provided. “I think PDP failed to mobilise its people that’s all.” The APC chairman in the state also urged security personnel to ensure safety of lives and property during and after the poll. On the allegation of deploying people from Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna and Kebbi states, Abbas expelled the allegation, saying the population was more than enough to partake in any election.
