Residents of Unguwar Sokodabo in Abaji metropolis were thrown into confusion after a strange animal killed six rams in the area. A resident of the area, Aliyu Usman, said the rams were in an enclosure  in a compound in the area, until last night when the owner woke up to discover all of them dead. He said the suspected wild animal attacked the rams and sucked their blood after inflicting injuries on them, saying the owner later came out to discover the sheep dead. Our reporter, who visited the scene, saw some of the rams with their intestine outside, as neighbours gathered to have a glimpse of the dead animals. It was learnt that the Ona of Abaji, Alhaji Adamu Baba, and some members of his traditional council who got wind of the incident visited the scene. Another resident of the area, Umar Ismaila, while expressing fear, said it was strange that such incident happened in the area. “Honestly, this is the first time I can say such thing is happening here in Abaji, and I think the traditional ruler needs to quickly find solution because we don’t know if such animal may come after human beings to eat them too,” he said.
