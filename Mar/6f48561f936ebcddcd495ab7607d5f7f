Two suicide bombers have blown themselves up during a failed attack on a church service in a Madagali village on Sunday. Witnesses said two suspected Boko Haram bombers had tried to gain access into a Catholic in Shuwa community when worshipers gathered for morning service, detonating explosives few meters to the building. A resident told our correspondent that only the attackers died in the incident after they attempted to enter the Church through the Clinic. The Police Public Relations Officer in Adamawa State, Othman Abubakar, confirmed the attack, saying two female suicide bombers had attempted to attack a church service in Shuwa, killing themselves in the process. Madagali had come under several insurgency attacks including suicide bombings since its liberation from Boko Haram by the Nigerian armed forces.
