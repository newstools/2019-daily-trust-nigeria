The Nigerian Shippers Council (NSC) has expressed concerns over the imposition of multiple charges by multi-national shipping lines. The ports economic regulator is particularly worried that most of the surcharges are imposed on Nigerian shippers contrary to the provisions of the   United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  (UNCTAD). The Executive Secretary, NSC, Mr.  Hassan Bello who described the multiple charges as unjustifiable said  the Council  will take the matter up with the Global Shippers Forum (GSF) to call the different shipping lines and their agents to order. Bello  explained that while some of the charges were  supposed to be temporary, reduced or cancelled as allowed by UNCTAD and as the situation in the ports changes, the shipping lines  have maintained a permanent imposition of the charges on helpless shippers. He said  what is worrisome  is that even  incidents of piracy  that have nothing to do with Nigeria  are  given  different colorations  in what is targeted at  placing a surcharge  on cargoes coming to Nigeria. He said, “Everything that happens, even if it is in Togo or Benin Republic, it is attributed to have taken place in Nigeria.  Even local infractions like   somebody  just enters  the ship illegally even without weapons, it is reported as incidence of piracy. But that is not piracy, it is probably robbery incident. Piracy is total command of the ship on the high sea.” Indigenous importers may abandon Nigerian ports over high charges FG working to drive down shipping cost by 35% – Shippers Council Kaduna dry port succeeding – NSC’s  Bello
