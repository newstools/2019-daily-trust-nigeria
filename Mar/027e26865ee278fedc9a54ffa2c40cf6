Wellbeing Foundation Africa and Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine yesterday trained 72 health workers in Erin-Ile, Oyun local government area of Kwara State. The Senior Technical Officer, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Dr Hauwa Mohammed, said at the opening ceremony of the event at the General Hospital, Erin-Ile, that the training was aimed at improving the skills of health workers in managing child and mother’s health. “We are training this set of beneficiaries for two weeks, just like we did in other local governments. We have trained people in 12 local government areas of the state. In June this year, we will train all our beneficiaries from all the six local government areas on quality improvement,” Mohammed said. Some of the beneficiaries said that they were attending such a programme for the first time in all the years they had been practising as health workers. A midwife at the Erin-Ile General Hospital, Mrs Omowum Yusuf, who had attended other seminars during her 10 years of practice, said, “The training has really exposed us to a lot. There are some things we don’t usually pay attention to but which this training had enabled us to know how important those little things are in saving the lives of a mother and a new-born baby,” she said. Another beneficiary, Dr Ajiboye Kehinde, who said he had been a health worker for three years, also said whatever training he had received earlier wasn’t as intense as this latest one. “It will go a long way to help in reducing maternal mortality. It extends our knowledge on how to manage mortality in new-born baby and prevention of complications,” he said.
