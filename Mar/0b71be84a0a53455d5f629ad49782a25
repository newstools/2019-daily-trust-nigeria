Justice Josephine Oyefeso at an Ikeja High Court in Lagos yesterday sentenced one Olalekan Shonde to death for killing his wife, Ronke Shonde. Olalekan was initially docked before an Ebute Meta Chief Magistrate’s Court, Yaba where he was ordered to be remanded in the Ikoyi prison for killing Ronke. The murder was committed on May 5, 2016 at about 8.30pm at 3, Tiemo Street, Egbeda, Lagos when the man struck his wife with a fist blow to the head. The judge said the state had proved their case beyond reasonable doubt, noting that the circumstantial evidence was clear. “I cannot but hold the sudden provocation, the heat of passion and the retaliation. The violence used by the defendant was in excess of a reasonable man,” he said. Justice Oyefeso held that Section 223 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015 stipulates that a person who commits murder shall be sentenced to death. Ronke’s body was discovered in their apartment on May 6, 2016 and Shonde was charged for alleged murder.  He was arraigned on October 24, 2017 by the Lagos State government.
