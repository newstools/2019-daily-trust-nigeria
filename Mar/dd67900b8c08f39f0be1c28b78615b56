A baby was yesterday found dumped at a corner behind the office of the Civilian Joint Task Force (JTF) and Badarawa Primary Healthcare Centre in Badarawa in Kaduna North Local Government Area wrapped in a nylon bag. The mother left the child with a note written in Hausa. In the letter, the mother wrote that she did not do it deliberately but was scared of her parents’ reaction because of the kind of upbringing she had.  She begged for forgiveness and urged anyone who read the letter to include her in their prayers. A member of the civilian JTF who picked the baby,  Malam Yusuf Abubakar, said the child was discovered around 10pm on Thursday. “Some good Samaritans noticed something moving in a black nylon bag.  They reported their findings to us and we quickly went to scene to inspect. “Upon inspection,  we saw a baby girl wrapped in a nylon bag with her head outside.  There were some clothes in the bag and a note written in Hausa we presumed was written by the mother. “We notified the immediate traditional ruler which is the Sarkin of the area who immediately sent the child to the Hakimi of Kawo who in turn handed over the child to the Kaduna State Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development.” “We saw some people, a man and a woman looking out for the child but they ran away when they saw us coming, leaving their shoes behind,  I believe they know something about the people that abandoned the child,” he said. He noted that people have been coming to adopt the child but they refer them to the ministry where the child is being kept. The Commissioner,  Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development, Hajiya Hafsat Baba, confirmed receiving the child. “The next thing now is that we shall document the child and take her to the hospital for check up and immunization,” she said.
