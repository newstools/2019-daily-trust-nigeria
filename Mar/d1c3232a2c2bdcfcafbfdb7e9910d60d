Muktar Betara, the lawmaker representing Biu/Bayo/Shani Federal Constituency of Borno State in the House of Representatives says he is “under pressure to contest for speaker in the 9th Assembly”. Betara, a fourth-term lawmaker, first elected into the House in 2007, was recently re-elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The Chairman, House Committee on Defence, said there had been “enormous pressure” on him from incumbent and incoming lawmakers, to vie for the position on account of his “tested credibility and experience as a ranking lawmaker.” “Those rooting for me to join the race include incumbent and incoming lawmakers. They point to my experience as a ranking member and my achievements in the defence committee,” he told Daily Trust.
