Nigeria’s ex-minister of Aviation and spokesman for Atiku Abubakar’s Presidential campaign organisation, Chief Osita Chidoka, over the weekend, was stripped of his chieftaincy title, “Ike Obosi” and suspended indefinitely from the royal council by HRM Igwe Chidubeml Iweka 11. He was suspended alongside others for their sacrilegious actions of bringing dead bodies of two people killed during the Idemili North and south federal constituency supplementary election, to the palace of the Traditional Ruler of Obosi kingdom. The election was between Hon Ibezi and Chidoka’s younger brother, Hon. Obinna Chidoka. Those suspended alongside Chidoka; are Chief Linus Mgbakogu (Atta Obosi) and Chief Hyman Udemba (Aka Mposi Obosi). A source in the palace said in line with the tradition of Obosi people, the Igwe cannot set his eyes on a corpse. The source further said Chidoka, being a titled chief in Obosi community, knew that bringing dead bodies to Igwe’s palace is a taboo in the land. According to a statement signed by Dr Benneth Mozie, on behalf of the monarch and his chiefs in council, the act was a sacrilege in the tradition of Obosi kingdom which forbids the king and his council from seeing human corpse. The statement reads: “On arriving at the palace, these chiefs in council instructed that the corpse be off loaded and dumped in the palace, an insulting and dishonouring act, an abomination of the gravest magnitude. “After due consultations and deliberations with all relevant ancient traditional bodies of Obosi, the Igwe Iweka II in council, hereby announces the indefinite suspension from his cabinet of the above mentioned three chiefs. “This suspension is for their acts of sacrilege against the revered age-old customs of the people and Obosi ancient kingdom”.
