The electoral umpire had fixed Thursday as the day for the collection of certificates of return by all elected senators and members of the House of Reps during the February 23 presidential and national assembly elections. There are 45 serving senators that won re-election to represent various Senatorial Districts in the country, who will be at the International Conference Centre (ICC), Abuja, to collect the certificates of return.
