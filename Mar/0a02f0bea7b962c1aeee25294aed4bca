Eight days to the governorship and House of Assembly elections, one of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)’s candidates in Ekiti State, Sunday Omosilade, on Friday, withdrew from the race. He explained that he was withdrawing because “I can’t be part of an already determined process.” Omosilade, who is the PDP candidate for Irepodun/Ifelodun Local Government Constituency two in Ekiti State, said the neutrality and independence of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had been called to question with the conduct of previous elections, especially the last Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections. The letter dated March 1, 2019 and addressed to the state chapter of the PDP and copied to INEC read; “Please be informed of my withdrawal from the Ekiti State House of Assembly Irepodun/Ifelodun Constituency ll coming up on the 9th of March, 2019. “I have personally lost confidence in the electoral process, most especially, with the last Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections that were brazenly manipulated in favour of the APC coupled with the unchecked harassment/intimidation by security agencies before, during and after the elections. “The neutrality/independent of INEC has been called to question in previous and the just concluded elections in Nigeria, hence my lack of confidence in the process. “I have copied INEC this letter to intimate the commission of this development. “While thanking the party and its members for the opportunity given me to represent them, I feel I can’t operate under an already determined end of a process.” 2019: Ekiti PDP members  defy  Fayose, picks Aluko  as national delegate Tribunal begins hearing on petition against Saraki today Ekiti Poll: Fayemi wins, returns to government house
