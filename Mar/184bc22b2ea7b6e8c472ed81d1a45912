The Young Progressives Party (YPP) on Sunday said it has sued the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) demanding cancellation of elections in two federal constituencies of Bayelsa state, on grounds of exclusion of its party’s symbol on the ballot papers. The YPP National Publicity Secretary, Egbeola Martins said in a statement that the two constituencies are Yenagoa/Polokuma Opokuma and Ekeremor/Sagbama. The party said it is also asking the court to prevail on the INEC to withdraw the Certificate of Return already issued to the declared winners of the elections in those areas and conduct fresh elections that would include the YPP. Mr. Martins explained that it was necessary to cancel the elections due to what it described as breach of the mandatory provisions of the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended). “The wrongful exclusion of our party’s symbol by INEC after clearance by same to contest in the House of Representatives election in the aforementioned constituencies made it impracticable for our candidates and massive supporters to cast their votes in clear violation of section 44 of the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended). “It is upon the strength of this brazen act of illegality that we call on INEC to immediately recall the certificate of return issued erroneously to Mr Stephen Sinikiem Azaiki of the PDP representing Yenagoa/Polokuma Opokuma federal constituency. “We also call for the withdrawal of Certificate of Return issued to Mr Agbedi Frederick Yeitiemone also PDP representing the good people of Yenagoa/Polokuma Opokuma of Federal Constituency,” the party said.
