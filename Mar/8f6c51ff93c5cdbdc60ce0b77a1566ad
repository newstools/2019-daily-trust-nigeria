The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Niger State has protested the poll outcome declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The party’s chairman, Barrister Tanko Beji, who is its agent at the collation, refused to endorsed the final result. Beji walked out of the Collation Center few minutes after the women wing of the party staged a protest against poll outcome from the various local government areas. There was a drama when the PDP was called to endorse the result sheet and the Chairman was nowhere to be seen. The apparently confused Resident Electoral Commissioner, Sam Egwu said, “I saw him here not long ago. Where would he have gone? Can we get any PDP leader or agent to endorse this? ” But no agent of the party stepped forward to do so, while the APC agent endorsed the sheet.
