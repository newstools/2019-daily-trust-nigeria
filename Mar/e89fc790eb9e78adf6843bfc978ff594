The governorship candidate of the Action Alliance (AA), Ugwumba Uche Nwosu, has rejected the outcome of the election in Imo state. Nwosu, who reacted to the results of the election so far announced, which put the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Emeka Ihedioha, ahead said that the candidate did not meet the constitutional requirements to be returned as elected. Speaking to our correspondent immediately after the announcement of the results, Nwosu said, “The constitution is clear that for a candidate to be declared a winner he must have the mandatory 25 percent spread in at least two-thirds of the number of local government areas in the state. “In this instance, the candidate of PDP did not meet this requirement as he scored the mandatory spread in only 12 whereas it should be 18. I scored in at least 18 and if he did not meet the requirements, there should be a re-run as required by law.” Nwosu also alleged widespread irregularity in the three local government areas of Aboh Mbaise, Ahiazu and Ezinihitte. He wondered why the three local government areas could return such huge numbers in an election that was marred by voter’s apathy. The AA candidate said, “This result is totally unacceptable and I am calling on INEC to declare the election inconclusive and arrange a fresh election within seven days as stipulated by the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.” He also frowned at the conduct of INEC officials, who he alleged colluded with the PDP candidate to inflate the figures in the three contentious local government areas. He asked the electoral body not to allow officials who have been compromised to be involved in future elections.
