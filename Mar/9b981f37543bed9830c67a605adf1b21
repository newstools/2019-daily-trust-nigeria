The Adara ethnic group in Kajuru local government area of Kaduna state on Tuesday said they have lost 118 persons since February when 11 of their kindred were killed by gunmen. The Adara Development Association, in a statement by its assistant National Secretary, Barrister Luke Waziri, said Kajuru land has been gripped by a fully funded and supported group of terrorists that have been wreaking havoc in its lands. The Adara group said “when Ungwan Barde was attacked on February 10th, and another community, Karamai, was attacked on February 26th with 38 persons killed while Ungwan Barde village was attacked again on Sunday 10th March, and 17 persons killed and dozens of houses burnt, ‘nobody said anything.’” It said they recall that “while we were still searching for more dead bodies, Inkirimi and Dogonnoma villages in Maro were attacked.  52 people were killed and dozens injured.” It noted that the smoke had barely settled when an attack was launched in the evening at Ungwan Gora (Labi Village) with dozens injured and 43 houses burnt down. They said, “In all these, not a single person has been arrested, none was even questioned. This is despite the fact that all the attacks took place either in the morning or in the evening – in full glare of everyone. “The terrorist come in their hundreds, take time to kill and then leave without anyone being caught or apprehended by the security.” The Adara community said in a strange twist, nine Adara elders and village chiefs were arrested and thrown into the Kaduna prison on allegations of complicity. They called for unconditional release of those arrested saying their continued incarceration is a travesty of justice.
