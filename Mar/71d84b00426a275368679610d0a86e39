The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has said severe penalty awaits anyone who defaults in the procurement process in project execution in the corporation. NNPC Managing Director, Dr Maikanti Baru, also warned management and staff of the corporation against any action that contravenes the provisions of the Public Procurement Act in the award of contracts. He gave the warning on Wednesdsy in Abuja at a Supply Chain Management workshop for NNPC Procurement Managers. Baru cautioned staff against contract splitting and accumulation, which he described as a deliberate act by procurement managers to subvert due process. He noted that the corporation is committed to transparency in every aspect of its operations, adding that all procurement and contract awards in the corporation under his watch so far had been carried out in conformity with the Public Procurement Act. The NNPC boss directed the Supply Chain Management Division to step up its level of monitoring of the various tender boards for full compliance. He commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the early approval of the NNPC budget, assuring that as the chief revenue earner for the nation, NNPC is committed to the economic policies of the Federal Government. “The whole essence of the next level is to ensure that things are done correctly and speedily for the benefit of the people”, the NNPC boss said in a statement.
