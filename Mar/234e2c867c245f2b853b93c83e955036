The 4 Brigade Nigerian Army has said the military personnel arrested for cultism in Edo is not from the Brigade. A statement signed by the Assistant Director, Army Public Relations, Capt. Muhammed Maidawa, said preliminary investigation showed that the arrested suspect is not from the 4 Brigade. “The attention of Headquarters 4 Brigade Nigerian Army has been drawn to a media publication dated 23 March, 2019. “In the said publication, it was   alleged that Private Igbavbou Lucky and not Private Opiri Stephen as erroneously published was alleged to have been arrested and paraded by the State Police Command for cultist activities. He said the Nigerian Army (NA) is a professional organization with extant policies that regulates the conduct of its personnel and does not allow any of its personnel to belong to any confraternity such as cult groups and related associations, adding that any of its personnel who crosses the red line in this regard will face the full rigours of military discipline. “The alleged case of Private Igbavbou Lucky who was arrested is an isolated case. It is germane to state that preliminary investigation revealed that the said suspect is not a personnel of 4 Brigade Nigerian Army as erroneously stated in the said publication but a deserter from 101 SF Battalion in the North East of the country since January 2019. “Thus, his conduct is a complete negation of the minimum behavioural conduct expected from a personnel of the Nigerian Army,” he said. He appealed to the media to verify information before publication in order to avoid negative reportage capable of bringing the image of the Brigade or the Nigeria Army into disrepute. Maidawa assured that the case will be thoroughly investigated adding that the military justice system will take its course.
