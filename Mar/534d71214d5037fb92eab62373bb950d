Hundreds of Zambians have so far applied to be employed as maids and drivers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Kuwait, reports the state owned Zambia Daily Mail. Last month, UAE and Kuwait requested the southern African nation to provide 1,000 citizens to work as drivers and maids in the two countries. Minister of Finance Margaret Mwanakatwe told Zambia Daily Mail that medical and police screening processes have already started. She said government had engaged a recruitment agency to receive applications for the UAE and Kuwait jobs. “We have received an overwhelming response from Zambians who are interested in working in the two countries. The recruitment agency we have engaged has received about a thousand applications,” she said.
