The National Export Promotion Council (NEPC) has said the CBI programme connected Nigerian exporters to the European market with a potential to export over N8.52 billion (€21 million) in the next two years. The CBI (Centre for the Promotion of Imports from Developing Countries) contributes to sustainable and inclusive economic development in developing countries and this is supported in Nigeria through the Export Competency Development of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Addressing a focus group meeting on non-oil export, the Executive Director of the Nigeria Export Promotion Council, Olusegun Awolowo, said the SIAL food fair, held by the council, led to 36 MoUs being signed, as well as significant orders particularly for sesame seeds with an order for 19 containers being placed. The focus group meeting was held with relevant stakeholders to discuss the activities of the NEPC and ways of strengthening them for better services in future. Represented by NEPC’s Director of Policy and Strategy, Mr. Abdullahi Sidi-Aliyu, the NEPC boss said the NEPC-CBI Export Competency Development Programme strengthened the capacity of 12 SME exporters to export to the European Union (EU) market and trained 48 NEPC officials as export coaches.
