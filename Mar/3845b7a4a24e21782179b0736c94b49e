Edo State Commissioner for Finance, John Inegbedion and five other candidates who lost the National Assembly election have filed petitions at the State Election Petitions Tribunal. They are asking the tribunal to declare them winners of their various elections, saying they scored  majority of lawful votes cast. The candidates are John Inegbedion of APC, Abubakar Momoh of PDP, Hon Ehiozuwa Agbonyinma of APC, Hon. Omosede Igbinedion of PDP, Hon. Idiake Patrick of APC and Chief Blessing Agbomhere of PDP. The senatorial candidates that filed petitions at the tribunal are John Inegbedion for Edo Central and Engr. Abubakar Momoh for Edo North Senatorial District. Inegbedion, who is challenging the election of Senator Clifford Ordia of PDP in Edo Central, said he would prove allegations of malpractices and thump printing of ballot papers during the election. Engr. Momoh, who contested against incumbent Senator Francis Alimikhena, said  he won the election because he scored over 80,000 votes which had been the required number to win election in Edo North since 1999. The House of Representatives  candidates that filed the petitions included Jude Ise-Idehen,  Ehiozuwa Agbonyinma, Omosede Igbinedion, Idiake Patrick and Chief Blessing Agbomhere. Agbonyinma, representing Ikpoba-Okha/Egor federal constituency is contesting the victory of Jude Ise-Idehen, asking the tribunal to declare him winner of the election instead. On his part, Agbomhere who filed a petition against Hon Johnson Oghuma, winner of  Etsako Federal Constituency said nobody in the constituency voted for the APC in the February 23rd elections and that  he scored the highest votes cast. Igbinedion is challenging the election of Denise Idahosa of the APC, saying she scored majority of lawful votes and should be declared winner.
