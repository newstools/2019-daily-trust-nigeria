The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), yesterday, set a 15-point agenda for recently re-elected President Muhammadu Buhari, with strong emphasis on the Federal Government not to over burden the oil sector with taxation. Speaking in Lagos on agenda setting for the re-elected president, LCCI President Babatunde Ruwase, called for the intervention of the presidency to reduce the burden of excessive taxation on oil and gas investors in the country. He called for improvement of the regulatory environment to unlock huge foreign direct investment in the sector, especially in gas and deep-water exploration. He emphasised that there is currently a proposal by the Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA) to impose $1 levy on every barrel of oil export as well as new levies under the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA) amendment bill and the Maritime University amendment bill. He noted that too much levies will further discourage investment in the sector. The chamber also wants government to protect manufacturers of gas cylinders to promote industrialisation, self-reliance and conservation of foreign exchange, adding that the nation already has huge capacity to meet local cylinder demands. On the power sector, Ruwase noted that due to unstable power supply, many businesses spend as much as 20-30% of their total operating cost on generating power, hence proposed that policies and incentives be put in place to encourage decentralisation and more off grid solutions.
