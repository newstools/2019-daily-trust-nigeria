Another building collapsed yesterday on Lagos Island but without any casualty, just as the Lagos State government urged occupants of marked distressed buildings across the state to immediately vacate them pending the arrival of the demolition team of the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA). The Lagos State Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Prince Rotimi Ogunleye, said the collapsed building, located on 50, Kakawa Street, Campos, Lagos Island, had actually been identified as distressed by officers of the LASBCA and all the necessary statutory notices had been duly served. “It was one of the defective structures marked for removal by the agency. Fortunately, occupants had been evacuated before the incidents occurred. Immediately, the Lagos State Rescue Team and LASBCA were alerted and they moved to site promptly to check all adjoining buildings so as to evacuate the occupants to avoid any further hazards,” Ogunleye said. He added that 25 buildings had already been removed by LASBCA as the government stepped up measures to rid the state of distressed buildings to prevent loss of lives and property.
