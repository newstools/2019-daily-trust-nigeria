Justice Watilat Ibrahim of the Federal High Court, Abeokuta, Ogun State, has convicted and sentenced one Agboola Taiwo, alias Mary Caesar, to four months imprisonment for impersonation. The convict was arraigned in court on December 10, 2018. Taiwo was accused of fraudulently presenting himself via his mail as Katherine Bishop, a white female, to one James, a United States of America citizen in November 2018. The accused pleaded guilty and opted for a plea bargain, prompting the prosecuting counsel, Mabas Mabur, to pray the court to convict him accordingly. Justice Ibrahim consequently convicted and sentenced him to four months imprisonment with effect from the date of his arrest. The convict also forfeited his two phones to the Federal Government of Nigeria, being part of the proceeds of his fraudulent act.
