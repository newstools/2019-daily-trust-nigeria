The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Zubairu Muazu, has assured voters that armed policemen will be stationed close to each polling unit across the metropolis to prevent the destruction of ballot boxes during Saturday’s governorship and House of Assembly elections. Muazu explained the move was to forestall a repeat of the upheaval at Ago Palace Way, Okota, during the February 23, 2019 Presidential and National Assembly elections where hoodlums destroyed ballot boxes and papers. Telling journalists on Tuesday that the Lagos police command was fully prepared for the elections, Muazu said the police and other sister agencies had met and discussed the security lapses during the last elections, and had mapped out strategies on how to tackle the challenges in the next ones. He said, “We have identified the flash points where adequate patrol and security should be provided. The Electoral Law does not permit armed policemen in polling booths and does not also allow the military to stay near the booths. But with our experience in the last presidential election, we will keep them close to the polling booths for quick response to distress calls. “Truly, we witnessed disruption of the electoral process in some polling stations, notably, Ago Palace Way, Okota and some few others, but some media platforms, especially the social media, reported half-truths, and in some instances, outright fabrications on what actually transpired. “I reemphasize that Lagos is safe and peaceful. There is no ethnic group or community under threat in any part of the state. We have reviewed and redoubled our strategies to ensure a peaceful conduct of gubernatorial and House of Assembly elections. Our surveillance and patrols are intensified.”   We’ll keep armed policemen near polling units – Lagos CP #NigeriaDecides: Police arrest 4 in Lagos over alleged burning of ballot boxes INEC confirms death of one staff
