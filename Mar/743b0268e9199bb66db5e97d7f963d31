Candidate of the Progressive Peoples Alliance (PPA) in the March 9, 2019 Governorship election, Dr. Oghenejodiakpo Obire has congratulated Senator Ifeanyi Okowa on his resounding victory at the polls, saying building a collective stronger Delta State supersedes his personal political ambition. Dr Obire, who visited the governor in Government House, Asaba, stated that “after elections, governance and peace are essential for development.” “I came here to congratulate the governor personally because the election was a tedious process and it is only good that we congratulate him for emerging victorious. If you contest in an election, you either win or you lose. “But, as it concerns the governorship elections, we are all winners. We are ready to partner with the governor in whichever way he believes we should assist him. I, as an individual, will gladly assist him and I urge other gubernatorial candidates of other political parties to come out and congratulate Governor Okowa for us to move on as a state because no individual interest or political affiliation should be bigger than our collective interests as Deltans”, Obire, a former APC governorship aspirant before defecting to the PPA echoed. Responding, Dr Okowa thanked Dr. Obire for the courtesy call and said: “We are all Deltans and as brothers, I am ready to partner with all Deltans as much as possible for us to build a stronger Delta State. “It is important that we run a state that will be in the best interest of our people. That is why we consult our people, we engage in town hall meetings, because the overriding objective of governance is meeting the yearnings and aspirations of our people.” Defection deepens Uduaghan, Okowa rivalry 2019 Election: Nobody can intimidate us — Okowa ACPN to Deltans: Reject Okowa, PDP cabals in March 9 elections
