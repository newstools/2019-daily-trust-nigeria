Donald Trump claims he has been completely exonerated by an inquiry into allegations Russia conspired to help him win the 2016 election. A summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s long-awaited report released on Sunday found the Trump campaign had not conspired with Russia. However it was inconclusive on whether Mr Trump had obstructed justice. The Russia allegations had cast a shadow over Mr Trump’s presidency and his chances of re-election in 2020. Opposition Democrats are demanding full access to Mr Mueller’s report, which was summarised for Congress by Attorney General William Barr. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Mr Trump would let Mr Barr decide what to release but the president himself was “more than happy for any of this stuff to come out”.
