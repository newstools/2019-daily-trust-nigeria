That should tell you that people are more informed and enlightened about the political process,” Ayoola Olaniyi, a resident said. Another resident, Uche Daniel, attributed the high number of candidates to the increase in registered political parties in the country. “There are 91 registered political parties in the country. This doubles the number registered in 2016. So these parties would surely field candidates,” he said.  FCT poll holds tomorrow FCT poll holds tomorrow APC, PDP, APGA  lead FCT  council polls
