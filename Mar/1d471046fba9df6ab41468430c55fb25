Kaduna state governor, Nasir El-Rufai, on Tuesday inaugurated members of the state’s Transition Committee ahead of May 29. He said the committee will appraise his administrations’ work in the last four years to enable him put workable plans together for the next four years – in his second tenure in office. El-Rufai, who was represented by the secretary to the State Government and Vice Chairman of the Committee, Balarabe Abbas, said the committee will lay emphasis on the concept of ‘Putting people first’, which is the fulcrum of his administrations’ agenda. He said the choice of “Putting people first” as the thrust for his second term bid is not only apt, but demonstrates that his administration exerted deliberate efforts to feel the pulse of the people and their perceptions of governance. “Four years ago, we were all party to this administration’s promise to ‘Make Kaduna State Great Again’. Over these years, a lot of work has gone into fulfilling the promises made, and despite numerous challenges faced, we endured. “What this period means therefore is the fact that it is crucial and vital that a smooth, successful and seamless transition into the next phase of governance is assured.” He noted that the committee’s Terms of Reference as propounded are to:  My re-election a done deal — El-Rufai We’re implementing transition c’ttee report-El-Rufai El-Rufai and Atiku:  Reigniting 13-year-old feud
