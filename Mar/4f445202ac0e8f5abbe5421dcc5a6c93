Former Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Olabode George has hailed the victory of the party in Osun Governorship Election Petition Tribunal, saying the will of the people has prevailed. Chief George while reacting to the declaration of the party’s candidate, Senator Ademola Adeleke as the winner of the September 2018 governorship election said the judiciary has proven to be above the whims and caprices of any individual. According to him, the Tribunal Justices by their decision had restored hope to Nigerians who were initially despondent about the outcome of Osun Governorship Elections. “This is a new beginning. The rule of law has come to stay in Nigeria. I commend the people of Osun State for their patience”, he said. He added, “Nigeria that we thought people were despondent, people were angry but were quiet and I said this is like a graveyard silence. Don’t relent. This has confirmed that prayer is much stronger than physical power. It is going to be well with this nation. “This result has opened the journey now to promised land. You cannot do anything that is hidden. I thank God Almighty that truth has prevailed and those justices have shown that no matter how long truth will prevail and they have allowed the will of the people to prevail. “It’s a lesson to this country. I remember the day they were messing up the election there I kept talking to the people of Osun. Justice has prevailed.” Atiku hails Osun election tribunal’s verdict, says judiciary truly defender of democracy Osun Guber Poll: Tribunal upholds PDP's claims of alteration of results Osun Governorship: Adeleke, PDP urge tribunal to uphold their petition
