The governorship candidate of PDP in Yobe State, Amb. Umar Iliya Damagum, has congratulated the governor-elect, Hon. Mai Mala Buni of the APC, over his victory in the election. Damagum, who spoke shortly after a PDP stakeholders meeting that reviewed the outcome of the general elections, said they had no option but to accept the will of God. “Even though there are so many things that bedevilled the elections, but a winner has been announced; we have no option but accept the will of God and move forward to do what is important for me and my supporters,” he noted. Damagum explained also that the issue he had with the election would not stop him from congratulating the winner, and urged the governor-elect to use his mandate for the good of those who elected them. “I congratulate him (Mai Mala) and call on him to look at Yobe as his entire constituency, knowing that God has given him this opportunity that every other person living in Yobe is his responsibility. He should be just, and I wish him all the best,” he added. On whether he would go to the election tribunal, Damagum said he cannot go into what he was uncertain about. “I had a good running battle but with what is happening in the country and the judiciary itself, I don’t think I would go into an uncertain venture.” He used the opportunity to thank his supporters and expressed optimism that a bright and better future awaited the party.
