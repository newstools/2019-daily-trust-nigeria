President Muhammadu Buhari has declined assent to two bills passed by the National Assembly, citing discrepancies with global best practices and duplication of duties of already existing agencies. The bills are the Chartered Institute of Training and Development of Nigeria Bill and the Nigerian Aeronautic Research Rescue Bill. The president conveyed his decision to decline his assents to the bills yesterday, via a letter transmitted to the House of Representatives, and read on the floor of the House during plenary by Speaker Yakubu Dogara. According to the letter, Buhari’s decision to decline assent to the Chartered Institute of Training and Development of Nigeria Bill was because of “concerns that the Institute does not possess the capacity of the requirements that might be imposed on it if the bill is assented to.” On the Nigerian Aeronautic Research Rescue Bill, recently passed by the National Assembly, the President said there were numerous discrepancies in the bill, which would make it not to be in tandem global best practices in the aviation industry worldwide. He further pointed out that certain sections of the bill constituted a duplication of the functions of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), as well as other sister agencies. Meanwhile, the House yesterday adjourned plenary till Tuesday, April 2, 2019, to enable the various standing Committees to work on their respective 2019 budget defence.
