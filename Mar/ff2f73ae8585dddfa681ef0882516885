A chieftain of All Progressives Congress (APC) jn Sokoto state, Engineer Abdulkadir Waziri, has called for the deployment of more security agents at polling units during the supplementary election scheduled for March 23. The election will be conducted at 136 polling units scattered across the state. According to him, the call  became necessary in view of the massive rigging, vote buying and ballot box stuffing witnessed at the last Saturday’s Governorship and State House of Assembly elections in the state. He alleged that there were no security personnel at some polling units, especially in the rural areas which paved way for massive rigging in favour of the ruling party in the state. “Thugs should not be allowed at the polling units so also vote buying,” he said He urged INEC staff to be responsible during the rerun election and not to compromise. Meanwhile, the Nigerian Youth Coalition Against Electoral Violence, has called on INEC to rescind its decision and immediately declare Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal as winner of the governorship election in the state. The group also supported the Governor’s resolve to challenge the decision of the electoral body in the court.
