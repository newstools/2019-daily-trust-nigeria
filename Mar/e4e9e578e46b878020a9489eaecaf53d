Algeria’s ruling party, the FLN, has backed calls to declare the ailing president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, unfit to rule. The FLN’s intervention – which is expected to be decisive – comes a day after the head of the army Lt Gen Ahmed Gaed Salah said a constitutional rule should be invoked to remove the president. Protests against Mr Bouteflika began after he said he planned to stand for another term. Under pressure, Mr Bouteflika then agreed to stand down after constitutional reforms had been passed.
