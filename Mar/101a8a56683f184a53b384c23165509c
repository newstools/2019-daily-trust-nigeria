As global reactions rage over the Boeing 737 Max plane which has been involved in accidents twice, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Air Peace, Mr. Allen Onyema has said the airline would await the outcome of investigations before making a decision on whether or not to cancel the order made by the airline. The airline had made order for the delivery of the 10 B737 Max planes prior to the crashes of Lion Air flight 610 in October 2018 in Indonesia and Ethiopian Airline flight 302. Speaking on the development yesterday, Onyema reiterated that it was true the airline made the order prior to the crashes but the planes have not been delivered. He spoke just as the airline took delivery of its third Boeing 777 aircraft which touched down at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) Lagos at about 3:20pm on Wednesday to a water salute staged by airport fire-fighters. Onyema however lamented that the airline was being unnecessarily attacked for ordering for the planes even though the order has not been received. He said, “We have 400 of these planes in active service, none of these countries where these plane are operating had ever risen up against their airlines for buying these planes. Not even Ethiopia and Indonesia that had accidents with these planes, their citizens never attacked them. However, Air Peace that does not have the aircraft has been taken to the cleaners by Nigerians for what didn’t even concern us.” Onyema noted that all the airlines that ordered for the aircraft, none has cancelled its order as they are all waiting for the investigation and action that would be taken by Boeing.
