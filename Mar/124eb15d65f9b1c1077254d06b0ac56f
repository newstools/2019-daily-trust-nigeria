New Algerian prime minister, Noueddine Bedoui, has been setting out his objectives in response to protests that forced President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to withdraw from seeking a fifth term. In his first news conference, Mr Bedoui said he would form a technocratic government that would include young Algerians who led the demonstrations. He said the government would only be in charge for a short time and he urged the opposition to engage in a positive dialogue.
