The presidency yesterday said it was not jittery by the presidential candidate of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar’s rejection of the last Saturday’s presidential election. President Muhammadu Buhari was declared the winner of the presidential poll by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), after polling 15,191,847, against Atiku’s 11,262,978 votes Atiku rejected the poll, describing the outcome of the poll as a “grand theft of the people’s will” and vowed that he would reclaim what he tagged as his “stolen mandate.” Speaking to the State House reporters, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, said they are not jittery. Mustapha said: “We are not jittery at all because the process was open and transparent. It was a credible election and we will continue to savour in the victory but in the process too, we will extend the hand of friendship for the purpose of nation-building and reconciliation. “Our electoral Act and the constitution have both provided a window for whoever is dissatisfied with the process of election to seek redress. That is the path and we will encourage them to go along that path,” he said.
