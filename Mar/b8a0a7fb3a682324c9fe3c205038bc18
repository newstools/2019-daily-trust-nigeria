The Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Dr. Maikanti Baru, has warned management and staff of the corporation against any action that contravenes the provisions of the Public Procurement Act in the award of contracts, saying severe penalties await any defaulter. The NNPC helmsman gave the warning at a Supply Chain Management workshop for NNPC Procurement Managers which held yesterday at the NNPC Towers, Abuja. A statement by the corporation’s spokesman Mr. Ndu Ughamadu, stated that Dr. Baru cautioned staff against contract splitting and accumulation, which he described as a deliberate act by procurement managers to subvert due process in the procurement process. He restated the corporation’s commitment to transparency in every aspect of its operations, stressing that all procurements and contract awards in the corporation under his watch so far had been carried out in conformity with the Public Procurement Act.
