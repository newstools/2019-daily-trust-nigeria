Many people are trapped, while many were injured in a collapsed three-storey building on Friday night at Shogoye Bus Stop area, Bode, Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. Eyewitnesses told reporters that the building was under construction when the incident occurred, at about 5:45pm when masons and other artisans on the site were rounding up for the day. At press time, no one was confirmed dead, as efforts were ongoing to rescue victims from the wreckage.  However, four of those who were trapped in the rubble were rescued an hour after. As at 8pm, rescue operations were ongoing with men of the state Fire Service leading the exercise. Eyewitnesses said some of those under the rubble were making calls to attract help. One of the survivors, Toheeb Gbadamosi, 19, said “Today is my first time working here. I just came around in order to raise some money for my upkeep because things are difficult. I thank God that I came out alive.” The incident led to traffic gridlock in the area.
