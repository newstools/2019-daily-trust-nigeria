Nigeria and India are working on ways to enhance the N4.31 trillion ($12 billion) annual bilateral trade between them in a way that would focus on investment. This was disclosed by the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Dr. Okechukwu Enelamah, when he received the new Indian High Commissioner to Nigeria, Mr. Shri Abhav Thakur, in Abuja recently. The minister said it has become necessary to expand economic relations between both countries beyond trade for increased investment. He welcomed the envoy’s interest in Project Mine, a new initiative by Nigeria to develop world-class special economic zones to position the country as the manufacturing hub in sub-Saharan Africa, and a major exporter of goods and services globally.
