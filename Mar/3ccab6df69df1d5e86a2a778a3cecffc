President Vladimir Putin has accused foreign intelligence services of beefing up activities in Russia, saying hundreds of spies were stopped in 2018 alone. Without going into details, he said “129 staff members and 465 agents of foreign special services were foiled”. Russian spies have themselves been accused of several plots, including the poisoning of ex-agent Sergei Skripal. Dutch, Czech and Swedish intelligence all say they have foiled attacks. Russia has also been accused by the West of trying to interfere in elections.
