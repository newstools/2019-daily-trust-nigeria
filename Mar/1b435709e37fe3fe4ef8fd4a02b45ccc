Accreditation and voting are going on smoothly at Ardo Maguwa/Kofar Ardo PU 001, Girei LGA of Adamawa State, amidst low voter turn-out and tight security. The Presiding Officer of the PU, who spoke to Daily Trust on condition of anonymity said there are a total of 770 registered voters in the unit. But Hussaini Yusuf, former Chairman of Girei LGA, said he was confident the All Progressives Congress (APC) would win the election despite a deficit of over 32, 000 votes. “I’m very confident we would win despite the 32, 000 votes deficit. Remember what happened in Kano, where our party came from behind to snatch a win. So, I know we will carry the day,” Yusuf said amid cheers from supporters.
