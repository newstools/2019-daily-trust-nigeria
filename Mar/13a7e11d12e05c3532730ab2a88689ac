The governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Yobe State, Amb. Umar Iliya Damagum, has congratulated the governor elect, Hon Mai Mala Buni of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on his victory. Damagum, who spoke shortly after a PDP stakeholders meeting that reviewed the outcome of the general elections, said they have no option but to accept the will of God. “Even though, there are so many things that have bedevilled the elections but winner has been announced. We have no option but accept the will of God and move forward to do what is important for me and my supporters,” he noted. Damagum explained that his issue with the election would not stop him from congratulating the winner, and urged the governor-elect to use his mandate for the good of those who elected them. “I congratulated him (Mai Mala) and call on him to look at Yobe as his entire constituency, knowing that God has given him this opportunity that every other person living in Yobe is his responsibility. So, he should be just and I wish him all the best,” he added. On whether he would go to election tribunal, Damagum said he can not go into what he is uncertain about, “I had a good running battle but with what is happening in the country and the judiciary itself, I don’t think I would go into an uncertain venture.” Mass defections brighten APC’s chances in Yobe INEC releases particulars of 2 guber candidates in Yobe Why Yobe recorded rancour-free polls – Gov elect Buni
