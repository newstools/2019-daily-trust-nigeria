A national commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Dr. Adekunle Ogunmola, said yesterday that he foresaw a situation where political parties would be allowed to print ballot papers to be used for elections. He said this is the practice in Argentina where he had visited to monitor the electoral process. Ogunmola stated this in Lagos when INEC presented certificates of return to the governor-elect, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu and his deputy, Obafemi Hamza, at the INEC headquarters in Yaba. The commissioner in charge of Lagos, Ondo and Ogun states said it was possible for Nigeria to attain that level with the cooperation of all, especially politicians. “In Argentina, political parties print their ballot papers. We can also get to that level. We need the cooperation of all and sundry,” he said. According to him, elections are costly in Nigeria because of the quality of ballot papers produced by INEC. He said in some countries, they use ordinary sheets of papers for elections. He said at a higher level, politicians display some level of camaraderie, but fail to call their members and supporters to order when the need arises. The governor-elect, in his response, promised to run an all-inclusive government to take Lagos to greater heights, saying his victory was for all Lagosians. “No victor, no vanquished,” he declared.
