The Coalition Against Terrorism and Extremism (CATE) says Timi Frank, ex-deputy national publicity secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC),  is suffering from “ tell-tale signs of induced hallucination”. CATE said this in reaction to Frank’s allegation that Tukur Buratai, chief of army staff (COAS), and the military high command of a plot to kill him. This was in reaction to an online message designed by the military in which they accused the activist of being a “Protagonist of Fake News”. In a statement by CATE’s national coordinator, Gabriel Onoja, the group said there’s a “fresh risks to Nigeria from people like Timi Frank and his paymasters who want to use the elections as basis to trigger fresh crisis that will snowball into major security concerns for the country.” “CATE will continue to prefer the outcome whereby the Nigerian Army deals decisive blows to terrorists and prevents them from achieving their goals. Where these goals happen to be in the interest of an opposition party then the party would have to bear the loss of the funds it paid to the terrorists to plan attacks,” it said.
