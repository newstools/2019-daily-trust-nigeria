The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has cautioned the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, against cancelling the already declared results of the March 9, governorship election in 14 more local government areas of Bauchi State. Addressing a press conference on Friday in Abuja, the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan said any attempt by anybody to tamper with the already announced results would attract serious consequences. The PDP said such a “wicked plot cannot stand”, adding that the people of Bauchi State were ready for a firm resistance. “Our party already have full information of plots by certain known top ranking officials of INEC, who have been bribed with huge sums of money by the All Progressives Congress (APC), to widen the scope of result cancellation beyond Tafawa Balewa to 14 more Local Government Areas and hike the number of cancelled votes from 70,000 to 184, 555. “To achieve this, INEC has been instructed by the APC to cancel already declared results in 230 polling units in 15 LGAs, in the state, cause confusion and pave the way for the APC to manipulate the March 23 Supplementary elections. “Seeing that our party, the PDP, and our candidate, Senator Bala Mohammed, are inevitably coasting to victory, being that Tafawa Balewa is home to the PDP, the APC is instructing INEC to cancel elections in more local governments where it plans to manipulate the processes and allocate fictitious results for the APC at the March 23 polls. “Our party is already in possession of a leaked document from the Bauchi INEC office, which exposed details of this wicked plot against the people of Bauchi State. “With Tafawa Balewa LGA, where the PDP scored 40,000 valid votes against the APC’s 29,000, it is clear that our party won the election with about 15,000 votes, only for the results of the Tafawa Balewa LGA to be cancelled for no just cause by INEC,” the PDP said.
