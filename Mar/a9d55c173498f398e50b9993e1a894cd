Africa’s largest cement producer, Dangote Cement, has maintained its dominance of the Nigerian market, accounting for 65 per cent of the total volume sold in the domestic cement sector in 2018. The company also exported 800,000 metric tonnes (MT) of cement to West African countries in 2018, strengthening Nigeria’s position as a cement exporting country, creating jobs in the economy, and earning foreign exchange.

Nigerian operations accounted for 14.18 MT representing an increase of 11.4 per cent over the volume of 12.72 metric tonnes sold during the preceding year.
