Daily Trust reports that the vice president met behind closed doors with Jibrilla Bindow of Adamawa and Mohammed Abubakar of Bauchi State in his office, on what may not be unconnected with the extra polls they would face next week.

Also, Bindow didnâ€™t speak to the press at the end of his meeting with the vice president which ended by 2:35pm.
