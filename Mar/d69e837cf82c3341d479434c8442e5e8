Hillary Clinton has ruled out a third US presidential run in 2020. “I’m not running, but I’m going to keep on working and speaking and standing up for what I believe,” Mrs Clinton told New York’s News 12 TV channel. As the Democratic candidate in 2016, Mrs Clinton was widely expected to become the first female US president, before a shock defeat by Mr Trump. Asked if she would run again for public office, she said: “I don’t think so.” The interview is the first time Mrs Clinton has definitively rebutted speculation that she might take on Mr Trump again in 2020. She said she had spoken to some of the declared 2020 Democratic candidates. “I’ve told every one of them, don’t take anything for granted,” she said.
