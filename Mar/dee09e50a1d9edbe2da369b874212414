The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has reiterated that the Value Added Tax (VAT) is a consumption tax primarily designed to support the poor people, and not to create hardship for them. Fowler stated this in Lagos recently at the maiden edition of the Nigeria Tax Outlook (NTO) Stakeholders Roundtable Series organised by the Nigeria Taxpayer Hub, a statement by the service said yesterday. He allayed fears that the increase in VAT may cause hardship for the poor, stressing that VAT is charged on consumption and capacity to consume. Fowler, who noted that the revenue generated from VAT is channeled towards assisting the poor by providing basic amenities that are needed in the society, said one is not liable to pay VAT on goods and services he does not consume. He said VAT is not charged on all medical and pharmaceutical products, including basic food items. “It is not charged on books and educational materials. It is not charged on baby products, fertilizers, locally produced agricultural and veterinary medicines. VAT is not charged on farming machinery and farming transportation equipment. “VAT is not charged on all exports, plant machinery and goods imported for use in Export Processing Zones and free trade zone, provided that 100 percent production of such company is for export,” he said.
