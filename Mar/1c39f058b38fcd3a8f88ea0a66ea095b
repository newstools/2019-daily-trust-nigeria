A House of Representatives member-elect for Shagari-Yabo federal constituency, Abubakar Umar, on Sundaysaid the people of Sokoto would not re-elect Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal because he has done nothing for them. According to him, the governor performed woefully in all ramifications adding that it was a payback time for the people of the state. “He has done nothing to the people and even to civil servants whom he starved of cash allocation for over a year now,” he said. He added: “This is why we left him and joined APC because of his abysmal performance.” Umar who was speaking to newsmen noted that “When Bafarawa was the governor of Sokoto, he constructed 500 housing estate with a flyover bridge and the immediate past Governor of the state, Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko had constructed 2,000 houses, flyover and tertiary institutions across the state. “But what did Tambuwal do for the people of the state? Virtually nothing.” He averred that the recently conducted Presidential and National Assembly elections in the state was a litmus test that confirmed that the entire people of the state were fed up with PDP’s bad governance in the state and thus voted for APC. He, however, promised to bring more constituency projects to his constituency and also sustain his scholarship scheme through which he had already sponsored over 200 students. In his swift reaction, the Publicity Secretary of PDP in the state, Abdullahi Hausawa said they were optimistic of winning next Saturday’s governorship election in the state. He said Governor Tambuwal had achieved a lot in the area of education, agricultural, health and security which would earn him another term. “The people of the state are satisfied with his performance in these areas and are willing to vote for him en mass in appreciation,” he said Tambuwal’s political godfather, 10,000 others dump PDP for APC Whither Tambuwal Re: Sokoto PDP flag off: Gainers and losers
