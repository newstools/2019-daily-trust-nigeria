The APC In Plateau State said, yesterday, it is ready to meet its opponent, the PDP, for a supplementary election as soon as INEC fixes a new date. Daily Trust reports that 49,377 votes which were cancelled following Saturday’s gubernatorial polls in the state had led to the declaration of the election as inconclusive. The cancelled votes were more than the 44,929 margins of victory as scored by the ruling APC. However, the APC chairman, Leteb Dabang, stated at a press conference in Jos, that the process of conducting a supplementary election had only delayed the party’s victory celebration. He said they were fully prepared and confident of winning the exercise. Dabang who expressed disappointment as to how the State Collation Officer, Prof. Richard Anande, handled the issues of over voting which contributed to the election being declared inconclusive, stated that INEC Chairman Prof. Mahmood Yakubu had already set a precedence on the issue of over voting.
