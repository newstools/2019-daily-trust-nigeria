The wife of the Ekiti State governor, Erelu Bisi Fayemi, yesterday assured women in the state of government’s readiness to protect them from any kind of molestation by the opposite sex. Mrs Fayemi said the era when women were maltreated was over, saying all the laws protecting their rights were now being implemented by Dr Kayode Fayemi. At the commemoration yesterday in Ado-Ekiti of the 2019 International Women’s Day, the Erelu said Gov Fayemi had been complying with the 1993 Beijing Declaration to inject the culture of gender equality into the state’s body polity in the area of political appointments. She said Ekiti had been recognised as a state with the political will to safeguard women’s rights due to the laws enacted by government to give them leverage in the society. Mrs Fayemi said the government was more committed to the implementation of the gender-based Violence Prohibition Law, Equal Opportunities Law, Child Rights Law and other safety policies that protect the rights of the womenfolk. She advised women not to feel intimidated or shy to cry out while in distress, saying laws were there to fight for them whenever they were oppressed. “How can a girl-child be gang-raped by a group of boys or a woman, be beaten up, or be victimised by seizing her property after losing her husband? All these can’t be tolerated under this government. Our government will continue to rally round you for Ekiti to be safe for our women and girls,” she said. The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Women Affairs, Mrs Foluke Adeyemo, disclosed that apart from empowerment, Fayemi’s government had also initiated policies and laws like the Multiple Births Trust Fund to protect women and make them relevant in the state.
