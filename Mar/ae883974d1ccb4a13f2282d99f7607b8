The Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Yekini Nabena, has accused the outgoing Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki and the minority Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus of planning to decide the leadership of the Senate and House of Representatives in the 9th National Assembly. Nabena, in an interview with journalists in Abuja on Tuesday, said Senate President and the PDP had devised plans to ensure that their loyalists took control of the legislative arm of government. The party’s national officer, who called for urgent intervention by the APC leadership, advised the ruling party to urgently roll out the zoning arrangements to avoid the repeat of what happened in 2015. Nabena said, “The outgoing Senate President and the PDP caucus have begun surreptitious move to lure some new APC lawmakers with juicy committee positions in return for their support for the PDP choice for the leadership of the Senate and House of Representatives. “Already, Saraki’s henchman, Dino Melaye and some other returning PDP federal lawmakers have scheduled meetings with some APC lawmakers from Wednesday to Sunday in a yet-to-be announced venue. “It is important that the APC leadership meet and urgently roll out a fair zoning arrangement to ensure that we produce our preferred candidates for all leadership positions in the incoming National Assembly. “Since Saraki lost his bid to return to the Senate and control of his home state, Kwara, he has devised a plan to ensure that he influences the choice of the incoming National Assembly Leadership. This is Saraki’s last-ditch effort to remain politically relevant.” Nabena urges Buhari to play role in NASS leadership election Saraki should tell where he belongs — APC Why Saraki can’t lead senate again — APC
