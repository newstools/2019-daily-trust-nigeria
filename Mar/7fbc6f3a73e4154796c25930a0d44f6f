A middle aged man simply identified as Yahaya has allegedly slaughtered his wife, Hindatu Manager, over “marriage issues and misunderstandings.” Our reporter gathered that the incident, which happened on Tuesday night at Unguwar Babba in Jibia LGA of Katsina, has left many in confusion. Hindatu was reportedly found dead in the morning with deep knife cut on her throat and in pool of blood. Her mother, Fatima Yar Maaiki, was said to have raised the alarm which led to influx of people and the invitation of the police. She said Hindatu and Yahaya had been at loggerheads for some time which was mostly occasioned by his inability to fend for the family, saying that this misunderstanding between couples was natural but not to the extent of killing. When contacted, the spokesman of the state police command, SP Gambo Isah,  promised to make enquiries and get back to this reporter but as at the time of filing this report, he had not.
