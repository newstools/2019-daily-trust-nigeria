The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Akwa Ibom State has claimed victory in all 26 local government areas of the state in the gubernatorial and State House of Assembly elections. The party said results from the field proved that the APC won overwhelmingly but the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Mr Mike Igini connived with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) against them. Speaking today in Uyo during a press conference, State Chairman of the party, Ini Okopido, alongside other political bigwigs of the party like Atuekong Don Etiebet, Senator Ita Enang and Mr Samuel Akpan said INEC committed the most embarrassing electoral fraud ever witnessed in the state. He alleged that the commission, in collusion with the PDP, published and announced results that were different from the ones announced at the various units. “Our party rejects the sham and fictitious result as announced by INEC in Akwa Ibom State, as it was contrived, manipulated and concocted to suit the unholy alliance between the commission and the PDP. We rather insist on the result of the elections from the field, which gave our party an overwhelming victory in 26 local government areas. “The All Progressive Congress in Akwa Ibom State hereby vehemently rejects the purported results as released by INEC in the state. We call on INEC to recourse to the part of honour to cancel the election results forthwith to avoid any breakdown of law and order,” he stated. The Resident Electoral Commissioner, Mr Mike Igini has however, denied the allegations, saying he was not at any collation centre during the elections but in his office in Uyo. He said the results that were brought in by the collation and electoral officers from the different LGAs was what was declared, adding that he had said that the votes of the people would count in the elections.
