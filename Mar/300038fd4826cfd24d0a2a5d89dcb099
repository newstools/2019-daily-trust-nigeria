Razaq Atunwa, significantly helped to douse tensions and ensured sustainability of peace and security, which are the major precursors for development. “We must salute the courage and maturity of others who lost in the various elections. Their astonishing emotional composure despite suffering electoral misfortunes ensured that calm, peace and orderliness prevailed across the entire state, after INEC declared the various elections’ results. “We must also remind elected officers that the tasks ahead are enormous. Hence, they must be prepared to hit the ground running after assuming office, come May 29. Their campaign promises are articles of faith that should not be jettisoned. They must be implemented to the letter,” the statement said.
