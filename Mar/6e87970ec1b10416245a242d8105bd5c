Members of Kano State House of Assembly have begun search for a new Speaker that will lead the affairs of the legislative arm of government for four years. Daily Trust reliably gathered that some potential candidates for the job have started making underground moves to secure the seat. A member of the house, who does not want to be named, confided in Daily Trust that the seat was for the Kano South, adding that already some lawmakers from the zone had started making frantic efforts to have it. “But one thing that is obvious, this time around we want a fresh hand to be the next Speaker and unfortunately majority of those that have already indicated interest in the job served as principal officers in the past. “Very few of them have not served in that capacity and I can assure you we will choose the next Speaker among them,” he said. Asked for the names of the contenders, the lawmaker said “I think it is not yet time to expose them because we have not reach that stage now but when it is time, I will mention their names.” The lawmaker pointed out that choosing the next Speaker would be easy because some of the lawmakers that were perceived to be the most influential did not return to the house this time around. He said, “Had it been lawmakers like Baffa Babba Dan-Agundi and Yusuf Abdullahi Ata have returned to the house, that would have been a serious challenge for those interested in the seat.” He expressed optimism that the lawmakers would use their wisdom and experience in choosing a competent hand that will make the house vibrant. 9th National Assembly: Dogara moves to retain speaker’s seat Why leadership tussle in Kano Assembly persists Uneasy calm in Benue Assembly
