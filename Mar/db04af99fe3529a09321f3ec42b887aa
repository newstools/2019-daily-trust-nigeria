Majority of senators-elect of the All Progressives Congress (APC) are in support of the recommendation of Ahmad Lawan as the 9th Senate President, Sen Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi had said. Sabi, who represents Niger North Senatorial District on the platform of the APC, said it was not true that majority of the APC senators were “shocked” at the selection of Lawan by the APC. The APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, had during a dinner with President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday night said the party was recommending Lawan for the position. However, one of the contenders for the seat, Mohammed Ali Ndume, from Borno state told journalists in Abuja on Tuesday that most of the APC senators at the dinner were shocked and that the position did not represent what Buhari wants. However, reacting to Ndume’s claim, Sabi, who is Senate spokesman, said there was nothing like “shock,” rather, he said, majority of the APC senators applauded the party’s decision. “When our National Chairman made the announcement during the meeting, majority, if not all, the senators present applauded him. Everybody was comfortable with the position of the party. So, there wasn’t anything like shock,” he said. Sabi also said that the APC senators supporting Lawan were in talks with senators-elect of the PDP to gain their support for a smooth running of the Senate to deliver good legislations for Nigerians. He said he believed Lawan is the best man for the job at this time given his wealth of experience and track records.
