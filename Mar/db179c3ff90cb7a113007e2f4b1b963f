The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has explained that the court order issued by a state High Court in Yola, restraining the commission from conducting the governorship supplementary election was ineffective. Justice Abdulazeez Waziri had on Thursday granted an order stoping INEC from conducting the election in 44 polling units where election was cancelled during the governorship election held on 9th March. Fielding questions from newsmen, the Resident Electoral Commissioner in the state, Barrister Kassim Gaidam said the law did not empower courts to stop the election slated for 23rd March. “Though we are not aware of any court restricting INEC, however let me tell you that court order will not stop any election,” he said. Gaidam cited Section 87 sub (10), of the Electoral Act, thus:“nothing in this section shall empower the courts to stop the holding of primaries or general election or the processes thereof under this Act pending the determination of a suit”. Daily Trust recalls that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Ahmadu Fintiri, was leading his All Progressives Congress (APC) counterpart, Governor Muhammadu Jibrilla with 32,476 votes margin when the election was declared inconclusive on grounds that the margin of lead was lower that the total number of registered voters in polling units where election was cancelled.
