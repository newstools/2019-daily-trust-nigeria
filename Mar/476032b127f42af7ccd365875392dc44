President Muhammadu Buhari, nine governors, the national chairman of the  All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and senators-elect, who are of the APC, are meeting at the State House Villa, Abuja. The meeting, our correspondent gathered, may not be unconnected with the constitution of leadership for the ninth assembly. There have been agitations between senators-elect from the North East and North Central over the Senate presidency for the ninth assembly. The ninth assembly is expected to be inaugurated in June. The governors in attendance include that of Kebbi, Zamfara, Plateau, Jigawa, Kaduna, Lagos, Osun, Oyo and Kogi states. The four key contenders for the Senate Presidency, Senator Ali Ndume, Senator Danjuma Goje,  Senator Ahmad Lawan and Senator Abdullahi Adamu are also in attendance.
