The Kolmani River-II Well which drilling was flagged off last month by President Muhammadu Buhari is progressing satisfactorily, with drilling of 6,700 feet so far, the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Dr. Maikanti Baru, has said. Dr. Baru stated this while receiving an award presented to him by the Petroleum Technology Association of Nigeria (PETAN) Executive in Abuja on Tuesday. According to a statement by NNPC spokesman, Ndu Ughamadu, Baru explained that the target was 14,200 feet, although the depth could be longer depending on findings. Daily Trust reports that it is the drilling operations that will confirm the presence and volumes of oil and gas at the Kolmani River-II Well. Prospecting for oil and gas in Kolmani River-II Well is one of the recent forays of the government into inland exploration in parts of the country. Dr. Baru commended PETAN for its contribution to the development of the Nigerian Petroleum Industry and pledged support for the association. He said: “My pride in PETAN is that, today, we have the capacity and expertise as Nigerians to carry out any job in the industry that was hitherto done by foreigners. As a champion of Nigerian content, we will continue to support you in whatever way we can.” Speaking earlier, Chairman of PETAN, Mazi Bank Anthony Okoroafor, commended Dr. Baru for engineering transformation in every aspect of the petroleum industry since his assumption of office. He cited the resumption of exploration in the inland basins and the flag-off of Bonga South–West project which has been in the shelf for more than 10 years as fruits of the GMD’s visionary leadership and doggedness.
