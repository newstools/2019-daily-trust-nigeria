The Kano State Government says there is no crisis in the state over the announcement of results of the just concluded re-run election that saw Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje victorious. Addressing a press conference yesterday, the state’s Commissioner for Information, Muhammad Garba, said the state was peaceful with people going about their businesses. Garba said the Ganduje-led administration was doing everything possible to ensure safety of lives and property, saying government would continue to promote peace and harmony in the state. He debunked allegations of loss of lives during the re-run election, stating that “when the PDP claimed that two lives were lost in Nassarawa local government during the poll, we went to the area and hospitals for the purpose of investigation, but believe me, we could not establish the claim. “So, I debunked this claim and challenged anybody with information of loss of lives during the rerun election to come forward. We need such information so that can investigate the case.” He said there was no demonstration by youths against the announcement of the re-run election’s results.
