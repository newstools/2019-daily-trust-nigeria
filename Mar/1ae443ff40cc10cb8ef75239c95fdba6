Ekiti Deputy Governor, Otunba Bisi Egbeyemi, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to allocate oil wells to states of the federation to make them more buoyant and less dependent on the Federal Government for survival. He stated this on Sunday during an interview on Ekiti State Television (EKTV) monitored in Ado Ekiti. Egbeyemi assured Nigerians that they would enjoy more dividends of
democracy during Buhari’s second term saying the President was more determined to make a difference in their lives. He said: “The victory achieved by the President was a victory for Nigeria indeed and the masses who reposed confidence in him and voted him back to office. “This is the time for him to take some bold and radical decisions to make life better for the citizenry and ensure economic recovery. “President Buhari, during his second term, must make the states buoyant. He must take oil wells from individuals and allocate them to the states so that they can pay their workers, build more infrastructure and establish industries. “We have some individuals holding oil wells having billions of Naira coming to them every day while majority of Nigerians are living in poverty.” Egbeyemi also advised Buhari to remove People’s Democratic Party (PDP) members who are still on boards of federal commissions, boards and agencies despite the expiry of their tenure. Describing the situation as “annoying,” Egbeyemi warned that PDP members still hibernating in the APC-led administration may sabotage
efforts of the President to sanitize the polity. Egbeyemi also enjoined the President to constitute a think tank that will assist his administration to immediately hit the ground running after taking the oath of office for the second time on May 29.
