The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) has deployed three reactors to be installed at the Ikot Ekpene, Jos and Apir transmission substations to stabilise voltage along the 330kV Ikot Ekpene- Ugwuaji-Makurdi-Jos transmission line axis. In a statement signed by the General Manager (Public Affairs) Ndidi Mbah, TCN said the 330kV line had been exposed to constant voltage instability up to 360kV due to lack of reactors. TCN said once the reactors are commissioned, they would serve to substantially stabilize high voltage along that transmission line. Two of the new reactors are already in Jos and Apir (Makurdi) substations, while the third was taken to Ikot-Ekpene. Last year, TCN engaged a contractor to produce a holistic mapping of its Supervisory and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system requirements nationwide, and the report was subjected to an international workshop. TCN deploys 3 reactors to stabilise voltage at 330KV Jos substation, 2 others How NDPHC delivered 112 projects in 13yrs to raise electricity transmission TCN energises 330kv line, Damaturu substation in 90 days of takeover
