A Kuje Upper Area Court, Abuja, on Monday sentenced a 24-year-old labourer, Musa Haruna, to four months’ imprisonment for stealing aluminium zinc from a building site valued at N80,000. Haruna, a resident of Shadadi area of Kuje, was jailed on a two-count charge of criminal trespass and theft. Justice Abdullahi Abdulkareem, however, gave the convict an option to pay N20, 000 fine. Earlier, the prosecutor, Samuel Ocheche, told the court that one Michael Sylvester, a resident of Sauka Area, Airport Road, Abuja, lodged the complaint at the Kuje Police Station on March 12. Ocheche said Haruna criminally entered Sylvester’s building site and made away with his aluminium zinc, valued at N80, 000. He said that during police investigation, Haruna admitted to have committed the offence, and the aluminum zinc was recovered from him. The prosecutor added that the offence contravened sections 348 and 288 of the Penal Code.
