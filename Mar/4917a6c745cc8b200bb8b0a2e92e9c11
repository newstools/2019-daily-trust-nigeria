Sudan’s embattled President Omar al-Bashir on Wednesday appointed a new government, after months of protests. Bashir, whom demonstrators have been calling on to resign, in February, declared a one-year state of emergency and dissolved the federal and states governments. The long-ruling leader promised to form a new government of technocrats to address the economic crisis that led to the protests, which have seen demonstrators killed by security forces. “I announce the forming of the new government which consists of 21 federal ministers, and 18 state ministers to address the economic crisis,’’ newly appointed Prime Minister Mohamed Taher Eila told a news conference.
