A Federal High Court in Abuja has struck out a case against Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe and former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode over the disappearance of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu. Justice John Tsoho dismissed the suit on grounds of lack of diligent prosecution following the absence of the lawyer who filed the matter. A lawyer, Isaiah Agidi Ayugu had brought the application before the court seeking for an order compelling the Nigerian Police, and the Department of State Services (DSS) to prosecute Abaribe and Fani Kayode over the escape of Kanu from Nigeria. But the applicant failed to respond to the preliminary objection contending that the suit is an abuse of court process by both Abaribe and Fani-Kayode, who were joined as parties in the suit. Ayugu had through his lawyer, Oghenevo Otemu also sought the prosecution of Kanu’s lawyer, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, and his siblings Emmanuel Kanu, Uchechi Kanu; and sureties, Tochukwu Uchendu, Emmanuel Shallom-Ben. He had alleged that they had a hand in the escape of Kanu following the September 2017 military operation in his family compound in Afara-Ukwu, Umuahia, Abia State. He was eventually sighted in Israel.
