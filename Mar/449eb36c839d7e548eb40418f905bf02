Impart Africa, a civil society organisation (CSO), has thrown its weight behind the deployment of army personnel for electioneering activities, saying this has helped in ensuring the success of this year’s general elections. The country director of the organisation, Dr. Adams Otakwu, in company of other leaders of the group told newsmen, yesterday in Abuja, that despite some hitches, the success of the 2019 elections could not be completed without mentioning the positive role of the Nigerian Army. According to him, the Army provided a secure atmosphere for conducive, free, fair and transparent conduct of the polls, with election materials and personnel arriving promptly in 90 per cent of polling units. Otakwu said this was in sharp contrast with experiences of previous elections in Nigeria’s democratic history where late opening of polls was widespread. “The secured voting atmosphere provided by the Nigerian Army in most of the volatile voting areas enhanced the use of Smart Card Readers (SCRs) which was efficient and successful in 92 per cent in most parts of Nigeria. Voters complied with the order and standard as laid down by INEC. “INEC was comfortable with the secured atmosphere provided by the Nigerian Army and hence adequately deployed permanent and ad hoc staff members to respective states and polling centres across the country, with their welfare packages,” he said. He added that the presence of officers and men of the Nigerian Army in some parts of the country halted the incidence of compromising and inducing INEC staff during the elections. According to him, there were cases in which politicians offered ad hoc officials money, but the offers were turned down, citing examples in parts of Lagos State, where politicians offered presiding officers huge sums of money, but which they refused to accept. 21,084 police officers, 3 helicopters for Anambra governorship election Ondo Poll peaceful; Election situation room CSOs urge voters to shun violence, apathy
