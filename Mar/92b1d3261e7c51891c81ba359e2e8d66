The member representing Birnin-Kudu/Buji Federal Constituency of Jigawa State, Magaji Da’u Aliyu, has joined the race for deputy speaker of the House of Representatives. Da’u, who was first elected to the house in 2015 on the platform of APC, made his intention known to Daily Trust in Abuja yesterday. The lawmaker said he believed he had all it took to head the office of deputy speaker as someone who had the required legislative experience. Da’u, who was re-elected for a second term in the February 23 presidential and National Assembly elections, said he would add legislative value to the APC-led government. The lawmaker has now joined the likes of Abdulrahman Kawu Sumaila and Abubakar Lado Suleja from Kano and Niger states among those vying for the deputy speaker’s seat.
