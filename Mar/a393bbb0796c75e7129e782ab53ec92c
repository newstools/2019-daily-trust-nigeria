Governor Ibrahim Gaidam of Yobe State yesterday described President Muhammadu Buhari’s re-election as a reflection of people’s appreciation to his administration’s role in restoring peace and security in the state. The governor said this in a statement by his spokesman, Abdullahi Bego, to congratulate Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and the All Progressives Congress on the victory in last Saturdays elections. “President Buhari’s victory and re-election as president is a clear statement that Nigerians are on board with the policies and direction of the APC-led administration over the last four years and are confident that the president will take the country to the Next Level through policies and programmes that will make the economy stronger and the nation more peaceful. “H.E Governor Ibrahim Gaidam believes that the massive votes that the president and other APC candidates received in Yobe State last week speak to the relative peace that has returned to the state from years of Boko Haram violence and the hard work of the Buhari administration in making that happen. “There is no doubt that Yobe people’s votes reflect their appreciation of the Buhari administration’s role in restoring peace and security in the state and the role of the Yobe State Government in improving their living conditions. “Mr President can rest assured that, as last week’s election showed, Yobe is – and will always remain – a true and solid home of the APC and the people will continue to support his administration every step of the way.
