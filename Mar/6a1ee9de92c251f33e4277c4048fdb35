The Inter-party Advisory Council (PAC), Coalition of Political Parties (CUPP), and Coalition of Governorship Candidates in Rivers State have called on INEC to as a matter of urgency re-start the process of collating the governorship election results based on official results declared at all polling units where elections were successfully conducted. The groups at a press briefing addressed by their spokesman, Precious Baridoo, in Port Harcourt, yesterday, said the collation should be based on the figures brought by INEC officials and ad hoc staff detailed to conduct the elections. Baridoo who is the governorship candidate of Accord Party, said their call was based on the fact that INECâ€™s State Constituency Collation Officers across Rivers State had declared 23 PDP candidates as duly elected for their respective constituencies for the State Assembly elections. He said the elections ran simultaneously with the governorship election. He called on the National Chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, not to heed to the call by APC to transfer the Rivers State Residents Electoral Commissioner, saying the call was aimed at creating an atmosphere for the concoction of results and rigging of the governorship election.
