Chancellor Philip Hammond has signalled his backing for a cross-party consensus over Brexit, despite the PM still appearing to support her own deal. He told MPs they had “a solemn duty in the days ahead to put aside our differences and seek a compromise”. It came after Theresa May said the UK could still leave the EU with a “good deal”, despite MPs rejecting her plan. Battling a sore throat, she said: “I may not have my own voice but I understand the voice of the country.” Jeremy Corbyn has called on the PM to change course after her deal was “decisively rejected” by 149 votes on Tuesday. The Labour leader repeated his calls for Mrs May to “move on from her red lines” and suggested his alternative plan to remain in a customs union was “the only show in town”.
