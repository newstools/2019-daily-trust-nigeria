The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) has deployed three reactors to be installed at  Ikot Ekpene, Jos and Apir Transmission Substations to stabilize voltage along the 330kV Ikot Ekpene-Ugwuaji-Makurdi-Jos Transmission Line axis. In a statement signed by the General Manager, (Public Affairs) Ndidi Mbah on Thursday, TCN said the 330kV line had been exposed to constant voltage instability up to 360kV due to the lack of reactors. TCN said once the reactors are commissioned, they would serve to substantially stabilize high voltage along that transmission line route. Two of new reactors are already in Jos and Apir (Makurdi) substations, while the third one is being taken to Ikot-Ekpene. Last year, TCN engaged a contractor to produce a holistic mapping of its Supervisory and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system requirements nationwide; the report was subjected to an international workshop. TCN had since then progressed on its SCADA processes which when completed and implemented, would solve the fibre optic problem on the Ugwuaji – Makurdi axis of the 330kV Ikot Ekpene – Jos Transmission line. The transposition problem on the other hand is also being addressed. The company traced the loss of a 150MVA transformer in a fire incident in its Jos Transmission Substation in September 2017 to high voltage. TCN said the voltage fluctuation was caused by design problems on the 330kV Ikot Ekpene – Jos transmission line constructed over 15 years ago. It therefore reiterated its commitment to expanding the nation’s grid and noted that having delivered the reactors to the three substations, it would ensure that the contractor commences installation immediately.
