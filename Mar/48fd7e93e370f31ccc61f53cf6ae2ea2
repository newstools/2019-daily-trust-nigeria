The Kano State Governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, has called on supporters of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to be calm while collation of results of the gubernatorial and state Assembly elections are still ongoing. Governor Ganduje assured that there was no cause for alarm as reports were very positive and encouraging, adding that APC will emerge winner of the poll. This was contained in a statement signed by the state Commissioner of Information, Malam Muhammad Garba. The governor, however, reminded supporters and all political parties and the entire people of the state that it was only the Independent National Electoral Commission, (INEC) that has the mandate to announce results of elections and declare winners. Governor Ganduje therefore, urged people to always be law abiding and desist from taking law into their hands and any act capable of breaching peace in the state. As he expressed optimism of APC’s victory, Ganduje advised people to wait for the announcement of the final official result by the INEC before embarking on celebrations, based on wrong assumptions and falsehood.
