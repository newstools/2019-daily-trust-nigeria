The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal by a former presidential aspirant of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Jerry Gana, challenging the nullification of his nomination as candidate of the party. A five-member panel of justices presided by Justice Kudirat Kekere-Ekun yesterday held that the appeal lacked merit and upheld the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which in 2018 nullified Ganaâ€™s candidacy. In the lead judgment by Justice Ejembi Eko, the apex court increased the N500, 000 earlier awarded against Gana by the Court of Appeal to N3m in favour of the SDP, the chairman of the SDP, Olu Falae, the national secretary of the SDP, Shehu Musa Gabam, the chairman of the screening panel, Prof Tunde Adeniran and presidential candidate of SDP, Donald Duke.
