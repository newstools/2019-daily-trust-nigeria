A 26-year-old man, simply identified as Victor, has been arrested for allegedly inserting his fingers in the anus of a two-year-old girl. The suspect was arrested at the Ejigbo area of Lagos based on a complaint by the girl’s parents. The police at the Ejigbo Division told our correspondent that Victor allegedly lured the girl into his room and put on a pornographic film. He was said to have then inserted his finger into the girl’s anus and injured her. It was learnt that the suspect was trying to control the injury when the girl’s mother began looking for her daughter and traced her to the suspect’s room, where she observed the child was bleeding. She then raised an alarm which attracted other neighbours. The police said when the suspect was interrogated, he admitted sexually assaulting the girl but said he didn’t intend to injure her. The case was later transferred to the Gender section of the Lagos police command at the instance of the Divisional Police Officer, Chief Superintendent Olabisi Okuwobi.
