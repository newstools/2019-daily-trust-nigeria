The deadly fire at Cairo’s main railway station on Wednesday happened because the train driver left the cabin without putting the brakes on, Egypt’s public prosecutors believe. They say a preliminary investigation indicates the driver stepped off the train to argue with a colleague. But the driver, who has been arrested, blames corroded brakes, reports say. The train hit a buffer stop at Ramses Station, sparking a huge fire. At least 20 people were killed and 40 injured.
