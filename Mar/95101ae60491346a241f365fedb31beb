Students in Algeria have been holding fresh protests against President Abdelaziz Bouteflikaâ€™s plans to run for a fifth term in office. The 82-year-old president has until midnight on Sunday local time to register for the elections in April. Police have been guarding the offices of the Constitutional Council, in the capital Algiers, where candidates submit their files. Mr Bouteflika said last month that he would run, sparking rare protests. He has rarely been seen in public since suffering a stroke in 2013 and is currently in Switzerland for medical checks. He does not have to be physically present to register his candidacy. Bouteflika and a legacy for Africa ALGERIA: Ailing president seeks fifth term Gunfire, tear gas rock Congo anti-third term protests
