All campaign promises made by President Muhammadu Buhari will be collated in a specific implementation document, the Presidency has said. Laolu Akande, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Office of the Vice President, made this known on Monday when he briefed State House correspondents at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Akande said that the Presidential Committee on Policies, Programmes and Projects Audit which was set up by Buhari and chaired by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo had resumed work. Osinbajo, had on March 15 in Abuja inaugurated the committee. The vice president had said at the inaugural ceremony that the committee was set up to take stock of the administration’s efforts so far and to make concrete preparations for the President’s second term in office which would begin on May 29. Akande added that shortly after the inauguration, the committee held its first meeting and would continue to have regular meetings until its work was completed. “Its next meeting will be probably by the end of next week. “Even between now and then, the work of the committee continues because there are other background compilations and consultations that are going on. “The importance is to assure the nation that the Buhari’s administration’s second term is going to take off with detailed programmes; detailed policies after the work of this committee has been done. “It is to assure the people that everything that was promised by the President during the campaign – all of these are going to come together in a very specific implementation document that will be produced by the committee which has started its work,’’ he said.
