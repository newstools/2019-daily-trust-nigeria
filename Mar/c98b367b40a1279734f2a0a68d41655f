Men of the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) on Tuesday arrested two suspected car thieves at the PDP National Secretariat, Abuja. The suspected criminals who identified themselves as James Ayuba from Nasarawa state and Abdul Bello from Kwara state  were arrested along Michael Okpara Street, Wuse Zone 6, adjacent the Wadata Plaza. While Ayuba claimed he is an electrician and lives around the Sharp Corner area of Mararaba, Bello said he is an auto mechanic and has no business with car snatching. Luck ran out for the suspects when a street photographer noticed an unholy movement around a Honda car popularly called ‘Baby Boy’ with the registration number; Abuja BF 438 KWL, parked along the road and alerted the police stationed at the PDP headquarters. However, Ayuba who claimed innocent of the allegation also denied knowledge of his accomplice, claiming that he was passing by to submit his Curriculum Vitae (CV) at the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), an argument that was punctured when the Police dialled the number of his colleague with his phone and ‘Acid’ appeared as caller name. As the interrogation was going on, staff of FIRS and several others who had lost their cars to street criminals arrived the PDP secretariat, demanding that the criminals should face the full wrath of the law and expressed hope that their cars would be recovered. One of the Police officers who spoke with our correspondent on condition of anonymity, however, said the suspected criminals confessed to the crime. He added that they were taking them to the police station in Wuse. Items recovered from them were scissors, spanners, car keys and other tools.
