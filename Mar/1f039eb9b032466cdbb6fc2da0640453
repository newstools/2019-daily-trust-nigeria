An FCT High Court has ordered INEC to include the names of candidates of the Peoples Progressive Party (PPP) for today’s governorship elections in Kano and Rivers states. The governorship candidate of the PPP in Kano State, Hadiza Lawan Saba and her counterpart in Rivers State, Hon. Clifford Edanuko and their running mates were allegedly rejected by INEC when they were brought 60 days to the election. In an originating summon brought by the legal adviser of the party on January 21, Chibuzor Ezike, the party contended that INEC lacked the power to reject any candidate brought to it 60 days to an election under the provisions of Section 31(1) of the Electoral Act, 2010 as amended. Delivering judgment, Justice Binta Muhammed held that the rejection of the PPP candidates in Kano and Rivers states respectively was null and void. The court however refused the application for the payment of N2bn damages over to the PPP over the unlawful rejection and or exclusion of the candidates.
