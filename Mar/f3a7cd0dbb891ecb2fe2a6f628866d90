The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), yesterday, shelved the planned presentation of Certificate of Return to Zamfara State governor-elect, Alhaji Mukhtar Shehu Idris and all those that won seats into the state House of Assembly under the platform of All Progressives Congress (APC). This may not be unconnected with the Monday’s judgment of the Court of Appeal in Sokoto State which declared that the APC did not have candidates for all the elections in the state. The Zamfara APC and Gov. Abdul’aziz who had won  a Senate seat on the platform of the party said they had mobilized their lawyers to study the situation ahead of appealing the decision at the Supreme Court. The Zamfara APC had won the governorship, national and state assembly seats in the state. INEC said yesterday in a statement on its verified twitter handle, that  it had been served with the judgement and was studying it. “Consequently, the presentation of certificates of return for the Zamfara governorship and State House of Assembly scheduled for Wednesday 27 March has been suspended,” the statement said. None of the commission’s officials were available for comment on the fate of the three senators and seven House of Representatives members who were earlier presented with their certificates of return by the Chairman of the commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, in Abuja.
