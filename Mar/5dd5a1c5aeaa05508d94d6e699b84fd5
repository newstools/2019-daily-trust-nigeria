The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) said the power sector achieved a new record after it wheeled grid energy peak of 110,724.93 megawatts hour (MWH) to the 11 Distribution Companies (DisCos) last Wednesday. In a statement by the Public Affairs Manager, Mrs Ndidi Mbah, TCN said it was an improvement on the previous maximum daily grid energy peak of 109,372.01MWH attained on February 2, 2016. The new figure is 1,352.92MWH higher than the previous daily grid energy peak attained over three years ago. TCN also recalled on February 7, 2019, the national grid reached 5,375 megawatts (MW) of generated power. It explained that the maximum daily grid energy was the quantum of energy that is wheeled from generators to distribution load centres nationwide daily and is measured in Mega Watts Hour (MWH) while the peak grid generation is a singular high point measured in Megawatts (MW). TCN said the new maximum daily energy and the peak generation (power) show that TCN now has enhanced capacity and capability to wheel and transmit more power, provided the DisCos are ready to serve the load to electricity consumers. “It is also evidence that the ongoing Transmission Rehabilitation and Expansion Program (TREP) being executed by TCN is paying off,” it added. Electricity generation hits 5074mw Electricity generation reaches 4,883mw – TCN Power generation peaks at 4,987MW as capacity constraints persist
