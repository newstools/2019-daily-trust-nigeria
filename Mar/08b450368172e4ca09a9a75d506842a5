As voting commences at the various polling units at Kofar Hausa Primary School, Keffi in Nasarawa state, our reporter observed there was low turnout of voters in the area. He also observed that there are 10 voting centres in the primary school. However, only about 20 voters were seen on queues in most of the units, while others have less than 20 voters on queue as at 8:20am. A voter, Chukwudi Chinedu told Daily Trust that the turnout was low compared to two weeks ago when hundreds of voters turned out early morning to cast their votes during the Presidential and National Assembly elections. Speaking on the low turnout, Chinedu said: “People are not ready to come out now because they rigged last election. A lot of people came out to vote, only for the results to be changed. Even me, I just managed to come.” Another voter, John Bako, said people were disenchanted with the results of the last election, hence their decision to stay at home. “The whole thing lost steam because some of the people I spoke with before today said they won’t come out to vote as their candidates didn’t emerge during last election,” Bako said.
