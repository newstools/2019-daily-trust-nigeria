An Igbosere magistrate court in Lagos yesterday fixed March 27, 2019 for the trial of a 36-year-old businessman, Sikiru Olawale Olayinka, who allegedly stole $123,000 (equivalent of about N45 million), property of Zenith Bank plc. According to the police prosecutor, Inspector Nwosu John, Olayinka and his company, Excampo Nig. Ltd and others now on the run conspired to commit the offence sometime in September 2018 at Zenith Bank plc, Pen Cinema branch, Agege, Lagos. It was alleged that the accused person and his company stole the money, which was mistakenly credited into his Zenith Bank account No. 5070637886. Olayinka pleaded not guilty. The court, however, mentioned a related case in which the surety to the accused person was charged to court because after the accused person was granted administrative bail by the Special Fraud Unit, Ikoyi, he absconded, hence the police charged the surety to court. The trial date was fixed to dovetail with the adjournment date fixed for the related case.
