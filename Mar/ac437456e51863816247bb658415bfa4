The Commandant General of Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC, Abdullahi Gana Muhammadu has ordered the deployment of Deputy Commandant Generals, Assistant Commandant Generals and Commandants at the headquarters to different Zones and States for effective monitoring of the gubernatorial election. Emmanuel Okeh, the NSCDC spokesperson disclosed in a statement on Monday that the Commandant General made this known at the Corps Headquarters, Abuja while addressing the management team. He pointed out that the deployment was very imperative for effective coordination of the personnel before, during and after the elections in the six geopolitical zones. According to Okeh, Gana seized the opportunity to appreciate the efforts of the Corps personnel during the Presidential and National Assembly elections and urged them to keep the flag flying by remaining good ambassadors of the Corps anywhere they are posted to. In the statement, Gana maintained that his administration was committed to the welfare of personnel, adding that he ensured prompt payment of the sum of N15,000 made available by government to all personnel across board for the Presidential and National Assembly Elections. He said plans were underway for a follow up arrangement of another N15,000 to all personnel for the Gubernatorial and State Houses of Assembly Elections slated for Saturday, 9th of March, 2019. He urged personnel to classify the news making rounds about the short payment of allowance as an attempt by some individuals with sinister motives to discredit the good works of the organisation. “The CG explained further that some of those affected by the short payment were on ‘pay-day loan’ with Access Bank and other commercial banks which could not be deducted over a long period of time due to the introduction of IPPIS for payment of staff salary. “It therefore becomes apparent that personnel with such loan facilities were affected as the Banks deducted their monies at source,” he quoted the Commandant General as saying.
