The Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) Kano branch has asked the state Commissioner of Police, Muhammed Wakili, to immediately tender a public apology to the association within 48 hours for an alleged maltreatment and attack on its members while conducting their lawful duties. This was contained in a press statement signed on Wednesday by the association’s branch secretary, Barrister Mujtaba Adamu Amin, and issued to newsmen at a press briefing at the state chapter secretariat in Kano. “We demand an immediate public apology to the NBA for the attack on our members while on lawful duties within 48 hours of this press briefing,” it says. According to the NBA scribe, members of the association were attacked on the 19th March 2019 while working in preparation of election petition by heavily armed police men numbering about 30. “Heavily armed policemen numbering up to 30 molested and arrest our colleague while working on an election petition; the policemen were accompanied by a political party member wearing a red cap. “Therefore, we condemned the unprofessional act of the police for molesting and arresting our colleagues. “We call on the Commissioner of Police to be non-partisan and professional in the discharge of his official duties as it is becoming apparent that his action and that of his men is going contrary to the rule of law and their oath of office,” the statement said.
