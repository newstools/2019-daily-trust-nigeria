New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has vowed never to say the name of the Christchurch mosque gunman. “He sought many things from his act of terror, but one was notoriety – that is why you will never hear me mention his name,” Ms Ardern said in an emotional address at New Zealand’s parliament. Last Friday’s shootings at two mosques left 50 dead and dozens wounded. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a self-described white supremacist, has been charged with murder. The PM addressed a special meeting on Tuesday, opening her speech with “As-Salaam Alaikum”, which in English means “peace be upon you”. She said: “I implore you, speak the names of those who were lost rather than the name of the man who took them. He is a terrorist. He is a criminal. He is an extremist. But he will, when I speak, be nameless.” New Zealand to unveil gun laws after mosque shootings, says PM Ardern UPDATED: 49 dead in New Zealand mosques shooting NEW ZEALAND: Cabinet backs tighter gun laws after mosque attack
