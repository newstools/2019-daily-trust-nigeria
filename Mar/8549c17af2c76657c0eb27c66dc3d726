The Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) has inaugurated four different committees to come up with a mechanism for addressing the complexities and challenges hindering the growth and development of some privatised enterprises in the country which were handed over to core investors over 10 years ago. This is in a determined effort to ensure that privatised enterprises in the country provide dividends to the citizenry in line with the privatisation policy of the Federal Government. The committees, according to Amina Tukur Othman, Head, Public Communications, are also to provide policymakers with further insight into the practical realities facing the sectors in which the enterprises were privatised and proffer credible solutions to addressing the problems. The committees are on Housing Sector (the Bricks and Clay), Mines and Steel Development, Oil Palm and Automobiles as well as that on Paper Mills which had earlier been inaugurated. Speaking during the inauguration, BPE Director General, Mr. Alex Okoh, recalled that the National Council on Privatisation (NCP) at its meeting of April 12, 2018 reviewed the performances of some privatised enterprises in the past 10 years and observed that they occupied a strategic place in the nation’s economy but have remained suboptimal since privatisation. Okoh said the NCP also took into cognizance, the need to resuscitate and reposition the enterprises in order to enhance their market value and their overall contribution to the economy.
