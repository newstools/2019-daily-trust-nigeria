Former President Goodluck Jonathan says for now, he has no reason to quit the People’s Democratic Party. He was yesterday reacting to online publication that he had resigned from the PDP and quit politics, His spokesman, Ikechukwu Eze, yesterday described the news as fake and a calculated attempt  to rubbish Jonathan. He said: “For the  avoidance of doubt,  Dr. Jonathan has no reason, at this time, to resign his membership of PDP,  the party under which platform he became Deputy Governor,  Governor,  Vice President and President. “Those who derive pleasure in spreading fake information had better occupy themselves with more productive endeavours that are obviously more  relevant to nation building. “Obviously,  this is a fabrication borne out of mischief as the publishers of the fake story claimed that the former president  made the statement while being  interviewed by Nigeria News Agency, (NNA).  There is absolutely no way the former president could have spoken to a non-existent news agency, as none in the country goes by that name.” Forget the fake news.
