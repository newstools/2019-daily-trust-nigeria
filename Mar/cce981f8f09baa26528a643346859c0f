Four persons were wounded yesterday when a tanker laden with petrol had an accident at Ido-Ekiti, in Ido/Osi Local government area of the state. Many motorcycles parked around the area were burnt in the inferno caused by the spilled fuel from the truck. The incident, which occurred about 9.30am, caused panic in the town as residents in the area were said to be evacuating their property as they envisaged a major explosion from the scene. A witness of the accident told journalists that the driver of the truck lost control of the vehicle when its brakes failed, swerved off the road as he approached a sharp bend and the vehicle somersaulted. The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Public Relations Officer, Ekiti Command, Mr Mohammed Olowo, said four persons were rescued at the scene and taken to the hospital. “The prompt action we took helped in reducing the severity of this fire. Though people were wounded, no death was recorded. “We worked with men of the Fire Service and were able to restore normalcy in terms of rescuing the victims and in ensuring free flow of vehicles along that route,” Olowo stated.
