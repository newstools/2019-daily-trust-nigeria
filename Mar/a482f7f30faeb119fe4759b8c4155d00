The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has won the Tafawa Balewa constituency in the Bauchi State House of Assembly. PDP won with 29,933 votes against the APC that scored 25,210 votes. The PDP emerged winner in the election after the resumption of collation by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The result for the governorship election was, however, halted because of a court order given by an Abuja High Court following a suit filed by Governor Mohammed Abubakar and the APC. It could be recalled that the Tafawa Balewa local government results were rejected by the state INEC Returning Officer, Professor Mohammed Kyari, after alleged reported violence and intimidation at the local government collation centre. The local government collation officer, Dominion Anosike, disclosed during her submission that thugs stormed the collation centre and carted away the results compilation forms. Although she confirmed that the results she brought were genuine,  she alleged that  she was made to announce the results under duress. A committee sent by INEC to Bauchi headed by Festus Okoye had recommended that the results from Tafawa Balewa be re-generated and declared. The move was, however, halted after the court injunction after which INEC suspended the recollation of the governorship election results and went ahead with that of the House of Assembly which the PDP won.
