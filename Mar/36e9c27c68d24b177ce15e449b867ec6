The Accountant General of the Federation, Mr. Ahmed Idris, has warned Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) that have not moved their payroll to the Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System (IPPIS) to do so immediately or face the consequences. A statement by Mr. Oise D. Johnson, Head, Press and Public Relations (OAGF), said the AGF gave the order when he received in audience the acting Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mr. Abubakar Adamu, who was at the Treasury House on a courtesy visit. He said: “MDAs yet to comply with Mr. President’s directive to move their payroll to the Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System (IPPIS), should do so or be ready for the consequences of their action, as the Treasury House will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that Mr President’s directive is fully complied with.” He asked other MDAs to toe the line of the police who have joined the league of compliant MDAs. “I want to place on record that the Nigeria Police have fully been integrated into the IPPIS platform and their successful enrollment has paved way for the enrollment of the Nigerian military, which has further demonstrated the robustness of the platform and our avowed commitment to a transparent, accountable and efficient management of the nation’s funds in line with global best practices.” Earlier in his remarks, the Ag Inspector-General of  Police, Mr. Abubakar Adamu,  extolled the cordial relationship between the Nigeria Police and the OAGF, describing it as “a very  strategic  partnership  in the business of policing the nation.”  AGF to MDAs: Enrol on IPPIS or face consequences FG to centralise MDAs’ payroll, integrates paramilitaries Oil shock: AGF office alerts on job losses, financial crises
