The PDP has won 17 out of 30 seats in the Benue State House of Assembly, leaving the APC with four seats going by the results so far declared by INEC. Our correspondent obtained the record, yesterday, from the state INEC office in Makurdi. The record, however, indicated that the results of nine seats were inconclusive following cancellations or inability to hold elections in affected areas. It was gathered that supplementary elections would hold in the remaining nine constituencies on March 23 alongside the governorship rerun exercise of the state. At least 432 candidates participated in the Assembly polls across the state for the 30 available slots. The nine constituencies where winners are expected to emerge during the supplementary exercise include Ado, Gwer East, Gboko East, Kastina-Ala West, Konshisha (Gaav), Obi, Okpokwu, Otukpo/Akpa and Ukum.
