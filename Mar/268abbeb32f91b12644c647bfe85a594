The Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) and key players in the sector have asked the Federal Government to end its waiver cessation plans which it accords non-indigenous shippers in the next five years. This it said is part of efforts to actualise the full implementation of the Cabotage Act, 2003, which aims to promote indigenous participation in shipping in Nigeria. NIMASA and key industry players in the sector mapped out the plan to end Cabotage waivers given to non-indigenous ship owners, within the next five years. The proposal emerged during a meeting in Lagos between NIMASA and the stakeholders centring on the need for collaboration to facilitate optimal implementation of the Cabotage law. Speaking during the meeting held at the NIMASA headquarters, the Director General of NIMASA, Dr. Dakuku Peterside, said the agency was determined to ensure that Cabotage waivers were stopped in the next five years. The DG, who was represented by the Executive Director, Maritime Labour and Cabotage Services, Mr. Gambo Ahmed, told the stakeholders that part of the strategy to bring an end to the issuance of waivers was to develop infrastructural capacity and human capital with respect to training of seafarers to attain global standards.
