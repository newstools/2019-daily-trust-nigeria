The Benin Division of the Court of Appeal, Friday, dismissed an exparte motion filed by Ovie Omo- Agege, the All Progressives Congress (APC), senator representing Delta Central senatorial district, seeking to be joined as party to the suit challenging the sacking of Jones Erue-led faction of the party in the state. Justice Philomena Mbua Ekpe, in her ruling, also dismissed the application filed by Francis Ejiroghene Waive, lawmaker-elect for Ughelli North/South/Udu federal constituency to be joined as a party to the suit. Ekpe said the applications lacked merit as the appellants could not claim to be unaware of the case and could not seek to be joined or challenged the judgement at this moment. The judge awarded N300,000 fine against each of the plaintiff. Omo-Agege and Francis had filed applications seeking the Court leave to be joined as parties to the suit in which the Federal High Court, in Asaba sacked the Jones Erue -led APC state executive committee which conducted primary elections that produced the duo candidates of the party for the 2019 national assembly election. The Asaba Federal High Court had, on March 18, 2019, presided over by Justice Toyin Adegoke, sacked Jones Erue-led factional State Executive Committee of the party, and upheld the Cyril Ogodo-led faction as the authentic partyâ€™s State Executive Committee. The court also annuled all actions taken by the sacked Jones Erue-led executive committee, including party primaries and the list of candidates that emerged from the factional primary elections.
