Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State has said he will soon reshuffle his cabinet, assuring that there would be more opportunities for women. Ayade, while answering questions from a local radio station, said he needed to ensure gender balance in his administration. He, however, said more opportunities for women would not mean weeding out those already in his government. The governor used the opportunity to stress that he would not renege on his earlier promise to have someone from the southern senatorial district of the state to succeed him in 2023. Ayade, who was re-elected 10 days ago for his second term,  said  it was because of the need for equity and fairness that he will hand over power to someone from the southern senatorial district.
