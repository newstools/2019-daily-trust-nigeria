Kwara governor-elect, Alhaji AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, yesterday, said he will run a government that will embrace everybody in the state, including members of the opposition. AbdulRazaq said this in Ilorin, the state capital, while receiving his certificate of return as governor-elect. “This state belongs to all. We don’t see anybody as opposition. It is Kwara for all. All hands must be on deck to rebuild the state.  This is a poor state and a lot of work must be done. We will embrace everybody,” he said. He said the new administration has a lot of work to do to get the state back on its feet, and called on all Kwarans to support his government which will be inaugurated in May. “When you record a winning margin of 75 per cent as we did, it means that even those on the side of PDP voted for us. So, we are going to ensure that we all work together. We are not going to label anybody. There are good people on the other side too,” he said.
