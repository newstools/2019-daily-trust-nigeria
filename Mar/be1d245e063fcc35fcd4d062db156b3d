The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) yesterday called on the governments of Lagos and Oyo States to immediately address the impacts of the building collapse in their respective states, including taking steps to avoid further damage to the human rights of the people affected. It asked both states’ governors to give the victims and their families access to effective remedies in a transparent manner, especially in the areas of justice, adequate compensation and reparation. SERAP Deputy Director Kolawole Oluwadare, in a statement, said the tragedies indicated weak enforcement of building regulations and oversight by both states. He said SERAP was concerned that the responses so far by both state governments had been insufficient to deal with “the massive extent of the human costs of the incidents.” SERAP tackles Ajimobi over demolition of Ayefele’s radio station $322m Abacha loot: SERAP faults FG’s spending plans Missing N30tn: We have cases against APC too, SERAP replies Okonjo-Iweala
