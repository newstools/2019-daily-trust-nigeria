The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) has urged phone and smart products traders to shun fake products. As part of events lined up to commemorate 2019 World Consumer Rights Day, the FCCPC, formerly the Consumer Protection Council (CPC), embarked on a sensitization outreach to traders in Banex Plaza, largely believed to be Abujaâ€™s smart products hub, during the weekend. The Director General of the FCCPC, Barrister Babatunde Irukera, told the traders that they have an obligation to meet the rights of consumers by selling the right products. He said most legislation in the world do not recognize consumerism as human right but the case is different in Nigeria with the recent Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Act. Barrister Irukera told the traders that consumers are now more aware of their rights and enforcement mechanisms and there is need for traders to understand their obligations to consumers. He said though companies involved in providing services and manufacturing products are concerned with profit making, they must not do so in expense of consumer rights. He said the Commission will intensify consumer rights education across the country as well as strengthening enforcement mechanisms.
