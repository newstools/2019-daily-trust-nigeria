The President of the Church of Christ in Nation (COCIN) Rev. Dacholom Datri has been accused of dabbling into politics and inciting the congregation of the church against the Plateau State government with the aim to destabilize the state. The allegation was made by a prominent member of the church, Dr Simon Dalyop Pam, in a letter made available to journalists in Lagos, expressing dismay with the way Datri was bringing politics into the church and dividing the people of the state. But the Church has dismissed the allegation, saying it remained non-partisan even as it said the writer was not a member of the Church. Pam, in the letter, said, as a devoted member of COCIN, he had to pick courage to write to the President because of the interest he had to ensure peace and unity in Plateau State by advising him to stay away from partisan politics, which is divisive and breeds acrimony among the people. He said: “It is no longer a secret in Plateau State, Nigeria and the world over that you are taking undue advantage of your position to embark upon large scale partisan politics by sponsoring and driving a campaign against the All Progressive Party (APC) in favour of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). “Without having to make an effort, it is easily discernable that in the history of COCIN presidency, no one has ever let loose his partisanship as you.” But the Church, in a reaction made available to Daily Trust through the Public Relations Officer (PRO), Rev. Justin Ahmadu, said the claims by Pam were empty and showed that the writer is not a member of the church because COCIN had never taken such a decision to endorse any political party.
