The striking Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria yesterday locked up the office of the Chief Judge of the state, Justice Suleiman Umar Dikko, in a protest against alleged deductions of their emoluments and five-year arrears. The chief judge was later rescued by the state’s Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of Operations, Monday Ordiah. The state’s chairman of the union, Jimoh Musa, said the union, in collaboration with its national body and chapters from 18 states, joined in the action. According to him, JUSUN is alleging that the Chief Judge is alleged to have been making illegal deductions of staff yearly emoluments and five year arrears. Our salary has been paid by the state government, but the Chief Judge has refused to pay us for four months now, claiming ‘No work, no pay’. The state’s Commissioner for Justice, Abdulkareem Kana, told Daily Trust that the allegations against the CJ were false and unfounded, saying “There is also a court order against JUSUN from carrying out such lockouts and harassment of judges, staff and public in and around the court premises. Today, they are in violation of the court order and carried out criminal acts in addition to what they committed on the 13th November 2018 when they physically assaulted the Chief Judge of Nasarawa State while seating in his court.” Police rescue Nasarawa Chief Judge from JUSUN lock-up JUST IN: JUSUN locks up Nasarawa Chief Judge in his office How politics keeps Adamawa judiciary in crisis
