US President Donald Trump has defended North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in the case of an American college student who died after being jailed by North Korea. Speaking in Hanoi after his summit with Mr Kim broke down, Mr Trump said he did not believe the North Korean leader was aware of Otto Warmbier’s ordeal. Mr Trump said: “He tells me he didn’t know about it, and I will take him at his word.” Warmbier was jailed in North Korea in December 2015 during an organised tour. Pyongyang authorities returned the 22-year-old to the US in a coma in July 2017, and he died days later in his hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio. His case raised tensions at a time when the Trump administration was exchanging vitriolic comments with North Korea. Mr Trump told reporters he had mentioned the Warmbier case to Mr Kim and the North Korean leader said he was not aware of it at the time, and was regretful.
