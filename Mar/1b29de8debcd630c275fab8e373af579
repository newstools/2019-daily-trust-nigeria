There was confusion in Ibadan, Oyo State capital yesterday as a yet to be identified man allegedly killed himself. He was said to have jumped from a mast belonging to a bank located at Elewure junction, along Sango/UI road, Ibadan. A witness, Tosin Alabi, while speaking to journalists, said the deceased scaled through the back fence of the bank before climbing the mast. “He came in through the back fence of the bank and climbed the mast. He spent about 30 minutes before he eventually fell off the mast,” he said. One of the deceased’s  friends who claimed anonymity said that his friend was not a mad person as some people were insinuating, adding that that what happened to him was not ordinary. The mother of the deceased, Mrs. Alaba, said her son was not mentally ill, and wondered what pushed him to take his life. “We came back from night vigil and after we finished having our breakfast, we started looking for him not knowing that he had killed himself. My son was not mad. I still don’t know what pushed him to kill himself,” he said. The Oyo State Police Public Relation Officer, SP Gbenga Fadeyi, while reacting to the incident said the identity of the deceased was yet to be known, adding that reports reaching him was that a naked man was seen moving towards a bank building located at Elewure, along Sango UI road, after which he climbed the mast of the bank and eventually jumped from the tower.
