 A supplementary governorship election will on Saturday, March 23 hold in Kano, Bauchi, Benue, Plateau, Sokoto and Adamawa states where the polls were declared inconclusive, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said yesterday. The decision was reached at the commission’s meeting in Abuja, a statement by INEC’s National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said. According to him, the commission met Monday and reviewed the conduct of the 29 governorship and 991 state constituency elections held on March 9, where winners were declared in 22 states. Daily Trust reports that out of the 22 states where final results of the governorship elections were announced, the All Progressives Congress (APC) won 13, while the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) got nine. Okoye said, “The Returning Officers (ROs) in Adamawa, Bauchi, Benue, Kano, Plateau and Sokoto states declared the governorship elections inconclusive. “Consequently, the commission will conduct supplementary elections on Saturday 23rd March 2019 to conclude the process. Supplementary elections will also hold in polling units in all states where state assembly elections were declared inconclusive and winners could not be declared. “Details of the constituencies including number of polling units and registered voters will be published on our website tomorrow Wednesday (today) 13th March 2019. “The elections were declared inconclusive for a combination of reasons, mainly the discontinuation of use of the Smart Card Readers (SCRs) midway into the elections or the failure to deploy them, over-voting and widespread disruption in many polling units. “In compliance with the Margin of Lead Principle derived from Sections 26 and 53 of the Electoral Act 201 (as amended) and paragraph 41(e) and 43(b) of the INEC Regulations and Guidelines for the conduct of elections, the outcome of these elections could not be determined without conducting polls in the affected polling units; hence the commission’s decision to conduct supplementary elections in line with this principle. “Furthermore, the commission has considered a report submitted by the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) for Bauchi State on the disruption of the collation at the Tafawa Balewa LGA collation centre, which led to the cancellation of results for the entire local government. The commission found that there are issues that need further investigation and has set up a team led by a National Commissioner to resolve them.”  ‘Why inconclusive polls’ In Kano State, the election was declared inconclusive by the Returning Officer, Prof B. B. Shehu, because the total number of cancelled votes was more than the margin between the two leading candidates in the contest. The results showed that whereas Engr. Abba Kabir Yusuf of PDP polled 1,014,474 votes, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of APC polled 987,819 votes, indicating a margin of 26,655, while the total cancelled votes was 128,572. The total valid votes were 2,155,128 with 49,761 as rejected votes. As for Sokoto State, ‎the Returning Officer, Prof. Fatima Batul Muktar said the election was inconclusive as the margin between PDP’s Aminu Waziri Tambuwal and‎ Aliyu Ahmed of APC was 3,413 votes. She put the number of cancelled votes at 75,403 across 136 polling units in 22 local governments. The announcement showed that Tambuwal polled 489,558 against Ahmed’s 486,145 votes. In Plateau State, the Returning Officer Prof. ‎Richard Kimbir also declared the results inconclusive. He said Governor Simon Lalong of APC scored 583,255 while PDP’s Jeremiah Useni, polled 538,326 votes, showing a margin of 44,929.

In Benue State, the Returning Officer Prof. Sebastian Maimako declared the election inconclusive as 121,011 votes were cancelled, whereas the margin between the two leading candidates, Samuel Ortom of PDP and Emmanuel Jime of APC, was ‎81,554.

In Bauchi State, the election was declared inconclusive by Prof.‎ Mohammed Kyari because the number of cancelled votes was more than the margin between Bala Mohammed of PDP and Mohammed Abubakar of APC. Bala polled‎‎ 469,512 votes against Abubakar’s 465,453 votes, showing a margin of‎ 4, 059 votes. The returning officer said the number of cancelled votes even without that of Tafawa Balewa Local Government, whose result was rejected by INEC, was 45, 312.  Inconclusive polls in Nigeria Findings by the Daily Trust showed that between 2011 and 2019, INEC had declared 32 elections inconclusive. Within the period under review, there were 12 inconclusive gubernatorial polls; 10 senatorial, seven House of Reps, eight state assembly and three Federal Capital Territory Area Councils. There were two inconclusive elections in 2011 and another two in 2013 under Prof Attahiru Jega. There were four in 2015, one in 2018 and 23 in 2019 under the current INEC chairman Prof. Mahmood Yakubu. The states where inconclusive elections held in the past are Anambra, Imo, Kogi, Taraba, Bayelsa, Osun and Ondo. Sokoto, Kano, Benue, Bauchi, Adamawa, Plateau, Edo, Lagos, Abia, Nasarawa, Kebbi and FCT joined the league this year.  What lawyers say Speaking on the incidences of inconclusive elections, Chief Adeniyi Akintola (SAN) said Nigeria’s electoral process has not lived up to expected standards. He therefore called on the President Muhammadu Buhari to urgently sign the amended Electoral Bill 2018 into law to correct the observed anomalies in the just concluded elections. “The 2019 general election is an eye opener to us as a country that we must reform the electoral process. Look at the level of violence and the number of people that have died, which would have been avoided with a good electoral system,” he said. Barrister E.M.D. Umukoro asked the Federal Government to revisit the various electoral reform reports such as the Justice Uwais Panel report, Senator Ken Nnamani report and the 2014 National Conference report to institute a better electoral system. However, Solomon Umoh (SAN) said the challenges of elections in Nigeria have to do with attitude rather than laws and reforms. He said both the political parties, INEC and the National Assembly must first agree on the way and manner politics ought to be approached in this country before reforms. “You don’t legislate attitude. We must change our attitude to elections even before we go for legislations. Political offices are too attractive in the face of the high level of poverty in the country. So many people can do anything just to get into political office,” he said. INEC to hold inconclusive polls' re-run March 23 2015 Political Events in Retrospective 19 and 20
