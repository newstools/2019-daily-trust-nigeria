Hundreds of disable persons, on Monday, blocked the Bayelsa State government House over the state government’s refusal to allocate some slots to them in the ongoing employment into the state civil service. The protesting people comprises of cripple persons, deaf and dump, blinds and other disable persons, stormed the state’s seat of power in the early hours of the day, blocked the gate and the adjoining streets, thereby obstructing traffic in the busy Yenagoa-Mbiama road. Chairman of Association of persons with disability in Bayelsa State, Mr Eric Ekibowie, said that government promised to give them seven slots during the last employment of 1000 graduates into the state civil service, but did not fulfill the promise. Ekibowie, who spoke on his wheelchair, said: “The state government promised to give us seven slots in the last recruitment, but up till this moment, we have not receive any employment letter. “As we are here protesting, the government has assured us that they will accommodate…successful seven persons will receive their employment letters. That is why we will suspend the protest for now.” he said. The state Commissioner for Employment and Social Development, Mrs Faith Opene, said that the physically challenged people that took part in the exercise could not pass the exams, but since the government had already promised to give them seven slots, the seven names have already been shortlisted. She said: “The seven names have been submitted to the civil service commission and definitely when it gets to the governor, it will be signed and appointment letters will be issued to the seven persons.” FG seeks collaboration to provide jobs for disabled persons Benue: Physically challenged seek disability commission ‘Arab spring’ll happen in Nigeria if...’
