The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Katsina State said it has enough evidences to challenge the authenticity of the results declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, that returned All Progressives Congress, APC’s candidate Aminu Masari as winner of the state governorship election. Speaking with newsmen, the party’s governorship candidate, Sen Garba Yakubu Lado said the evidences will be used through constitutional means to seek redress and reclaim the mandate that was “stolen” by the APC in the state. Lado, while pleading with his supporters to remain calm, exercise patience and be law abiding, said the result, as declared by INEC was not the true situation obtained during the polls, adding that “our collated results from agents and officers on the field was far different from what INEC and APC announced.” “I’m optimistic of victory and will get it using legal means,” he said.
