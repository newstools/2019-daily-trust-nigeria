The FCT Scholarship Board has awarded scholarships to a total of 10,952 residents to study in various fields in tertiary institutions in Nigeria and abroad since 2010. The Federal Capital Territory Administration Secretary for Education, Dr. Bala Mohammed Liman, made this known during a sensitisation meeting with stakeholders on the activities of the FCT Scholarship Board in Abuja. The secretary also revealed that the board has concluded arrangements for the disbursement of scholarship funds to 6,942 beneficiaries in the six area councils of the FCT. Speaking on the task of providing education to all residents, the secretary said: “The provision of education is a huge responsibility that everyone must be actively involved in. It cannot as the sole responsibility of government especially considering government’s limited resources. “In keeping with its mission and mandate, the board since inception in 2010, has supported the education of 10,952 beneficiaries in various fields,” he said. The director of the board, Isah Rany, also appealed to both local and international donor agencies to support the education of indigent pupils and students in the territory. Such support, he said,  would complement government efforts in increasing access to qualitative education to FCT children at all levels. The director said the board sponsored 6,880 in ICT, science and technology; 394 in medical and para-medical sciences; 2, 829 in education, social and management sciences; while 38 were sponsored in Law. He called on past beneficiaries of the FCT Scholarship Board to also contribute their own quota to support education of their “younger brothers and sisters who also desire to have education but are inhibited by the inadequacy of funds at government’s disposal.” FCTA commits N1.3 billion to scholarship in 9 years Scholarship board seeks funds for 7,973 awaiting applicants FCT scholarship board disburses N255m
