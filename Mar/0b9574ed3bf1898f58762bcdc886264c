New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern has said she will announce detailed gun law reforms within days, after an attack on two mosques left 50 people dead. Ms Ardern said her cabinet had backed gun law changes “in principle”. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a self-described white supremacist, has been charged with murder. Police say the killer used military-style assault weapons modified to make them more deadly for the attack – all of which is legal under current laws. No specific details were given by the prime minister at her press conference on Monday, but she said they would made clear soon. Ms Ardern appeared alongside her coalition partner and Deputy PM Winston Peters, who has previously opposed changes. He said: “The reality is that after one pm on Friday, our world changed forever and so will our laws.” New Zealand to unveil gun laws after mosque shootings, says PM Ardern New Zealand: Mosque attacker was ‘lone gunman’ Ardern becomes N/Zealand''s youngest woman leader
