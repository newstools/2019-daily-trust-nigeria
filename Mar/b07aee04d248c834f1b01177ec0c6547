The management of the Lagos State Task Force has denied the involvement of its men in the alleged killing of a young school girl at Akoun Village in Ikorodu, Lagos. The news of the killing of an 18-year-old school girl last week allegedly by operatives of the Lagos State  Task Force had gone viral on an online platform. The Chairman of the Task Force, Chief Superintendent of Police Olayinka Egbeyemi, refuted the story, saying the agency was not involved in any enforcement operation in Ikorodu as reported on Saturday, March 23, 2019. Egbeyemi said it had become necessary to correct the misrepresentation due to persistent inquiries which officials of the agency had been subjected to in the hands of members of the public, and there was the need to set the records straight. He said it was unfortunate that the inaccurate report had been generating negative comments that portrayed the task force team as an irresponsible organisation. While confirming that a young school girl was, indeed, killed in Ikorodu, Egbeyemi affirmed that the police officer involved in the incident was not attached to the Lagos State Task Force. “It is on record that the officer who killed an 18-year-old girl, Adijat Shakiru, at Ikorodu, one Sergeant Mudi Emmanuel, has been arrested and is undergoing orderly room trial at the Provost Marshall Unit for professional misconduct over the killing,” he stated. He added that the Lagos Police Command had clarified that the policeman’s action fell short of the rules of engagement for the use of firearms and professional standards for the police, saying the officer would soon be charged to court with murder.
