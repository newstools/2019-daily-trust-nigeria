Officers and men of the FCT Police Command have been urged to pay attention to their health as they go about their daily work. The Assistant Inspector General of Police in charge of Medical Services, AIG O. M. Obembe, made the call while flagging off events to commemorate the World Glaucoma Week at the commandâ€™s headquarters in Abuja. The police chief said as strenuous as policing could be, officers must not forget to look after their health, noting that about 70 million people are affected worldwide with glaucoma which has thus made it a public health issue with about 10 million people made blind as its result. She noted that many officers hardly have time to go to the clinic, hence the services of free eye screening was brought to the command. The AIG also urged them to register for the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) to be able to access free medical care. Also speaking, the FCT commissioner of police, Bala Ciroma, said the event was important because the sensitization would help reduce the number of policemen suffering from blindness. He charged the officers at the event to go back to their formations and enlighten men and officers under them to go and check for early signs of glaucoma to prevent sudden blindness.
