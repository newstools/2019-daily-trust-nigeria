A former military Head of State and Chairman of National Peace Committee (NPC), General Abubakar Abdulsalami (rtd), on Wednesday harped on a free, fair and peaceful conduct of this Saturday’s governorship and state House of Assembly supplementary elections in Benue state. Abdulsalami, who spoke at a town hall meeting of the NPC in Makurdi, stressed the need for peaceful election in the state so as to engender development in the society. Represented by George Nakanda, the Media Officer of Kukah Centre, the former head of state said, “We are trying to enforce a situation where there are peaceful elections and ensure that there is peace after the elections.” Earlier, Governor Samuel Ortom, represented by his deputy, Engr. Benson Abounu, called on citizens of the state to embrace peace which he said is a prerequisite for development. He counselled contestants of the elections to accept the outcome of any process which is devoid of malpractices. The governor further hailed the convener of the meeting, adding that the town hall discourse would go a long way to foster peace during the elections even as he cautioned against acts that could lead to loss of lives and destruction of election materials.
