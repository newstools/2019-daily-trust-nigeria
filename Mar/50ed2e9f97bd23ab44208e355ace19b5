Mobile police on operation in Yobe state have expressed displeasure with the alleged non-payment of their feeding allowances for four months. The armed mobile policemen, who gathered beside UBA bank, at Central Round-about on Tuesday, said they would soon took to the street to protest if government did not settled them. One of the policemen, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being victimized, said they have not received their feeding allowances since December 2018. “As you can see us here, we are from 26 squadrons posted to Damaturu for operation, from different states. Right from December 2018, they have not given us any allowances for reasons best known to them, and nobody is talking to us. “Surprisingly, other operational personnel like military do receive their allowances promptly.  We want the presidency to know that we are not being paid, and if they want to close the operation we will gladly return to our respective squadrons,” he said. Another officer, who doesn’t want to be named, said that what he received as salary is not sufficient for him to feed himself and his family. “Instead of using the feeding allowances to feed here, we feed ourselves from the salary and our families would be there at home because we cannot feed or pay our children school fees,” he lamented. When contacted, the police commissioner, Yobe state command, Abdulmaliki Sunmonu, said that he is not aware of any policeman on operation that was not paid. “Even if there is, they have not reported to us. I want to know this people. They may have problems with the banks but we are not owing them,” he said. When asked if the payment of feeding allowances are up-to date, he said “Yes,  it’s up-to date. Thank you”. How non-payment of allowances undermines security Policemen protest non-payment of allowances in Maiduguri Police protest in Maiduguri over unpaid allowances, promotion ‘sales’
