Nasarawa State is one of the states where the Independent National Electoral Commission, (INEC) is conducting a supplementary election. INEC office in Nasarawa State is conducting the supplementary election for the four seats into the Nasarawa State House of Assembly in four states constituencies: Keffi East, Karu/Gitata; 3. Nasarawa Eggon East and Obi-2. This is due to the inconclusive nature of the elections held two weeks ago in four state constituencies and in four different local governments. The Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in charge of Nasarawa State, Dr Uthman Ajidagba told Daily Trust that: “The election is going on as planned. The polls started as scheduled, I and the Police Commissioner, Mr. Bola Longe have been going round to ensure that the robust security arrangement is effective through-out the period.” Most of the electorates said that they are happy with the security around polling units.
