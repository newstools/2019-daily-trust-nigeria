As supplementary elections hold in Sokoto tomorrow, the Nigerian Army has extended its ‘Show of Force’ exercise to six violence-prone local government areas of the state. This is just as it urged electorate to feel free and come out on polls day to exercise their civic responsibilities at the selected places. The areas where the ‘Show of Force’ exercise was extended were; Gada, Goronyo, Kebbe, Rabah, Isa and Sabon Birni local government areas. It would be recalled that the exercise being conducted in conjunction with the Nigerian Air Force, Nigeria Police Force (NPF), Department of State Security Service (DSS) and Nigerian Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC), was flagged off on Thursday at Giginya Barrack, Sokoto. General Officer Commanding (GOC), 8 Division of the Nigerian Army, Maj.-Gen. Hakeem Otiki, who addressed a motorcade before taking off in Sokoto, said it was meant to show the readiness of security personnel to tackle any form of public disturbance. He emphasized that the exercise was not meant to intimidate the public. According to him, it would also serve as warning to those who were intending to disrupt the upcoming supplementary elections.
