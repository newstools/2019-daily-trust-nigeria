The leadership of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has started mobilizing governors elected on its platform and key chieftains to ensure that the leaderships of both chambers of National Assembly are “loyalists.” Sources told Daily Trust yesterday that returning members of the APC caucuses in the two chambers, including new commers and the party’s national leadership in Abuja, were now disposed to sorting out issues ahead of the inauguration of the National Assembly. It was gathered that governors elected on the platform of the APC had been advised to work together with senators and House of Representatives members from their state to ensure the success of the party in the National Assembly. The move, it was gathered, followed the purported plot by the outgoing Senate President, Bukola Saraki, to influence the emergence of a new Senate leadership when the 9th Senate is inaugurated in June, this year. The Saraki group was said to have met last week at the Maitama residence of Senator Saraki where 35 PDP senators-elect agreed to influence the emergence of a new Senate leadership and retain the position of deputy Senate president. The group, which was said to have come up with Plans A, B and C, would sponsor one of them for the position of Senate president in the event two or more members of the APC caucus present themselves for the position on the floor of the Senate. The National Assembly (Senate and House of Representatives) will be inaugurated consequent upon the issuance of a signed proclamation by President Muhammadu Buhari.
