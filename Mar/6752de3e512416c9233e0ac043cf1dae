The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has halted the re-collation of governorship election results from Tafawa Balewa local government area. This follows an order by a Federal High Court in Abuja, stopping the commission from carrying out the exercise. Speaking to our reporter on telephone, the Bauchi State INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Ibrahim Abdullahi said that the body had received the Court Order and had stopped the collation process. He however, disclosed that it will go ahead with the collation of the state House of Assembly elections result for Tafawa Balewa which was not affected by the Courts Order. Details later.
