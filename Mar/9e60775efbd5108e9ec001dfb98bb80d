The Bank of Industry (BOI) has approved ₦N250 million to support the entrepreneurship drive of the University of Lagos, the Vice Chancellor, Professor Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, has said. While addressing newsmen ahead of the 50th convocation ceremony of the institution scheduled to hold April 1-5, 2019, he said, the university will give loans between N1m and N2m to start-ups from the fund. He said, “This will be an interest-free loan to students and it shall be a revolving fund.” Prof. Ogundipe said the University’s Business School is set to take off, noting that, when fully functional, the school would run short executive courses and professional degrees. “In the last one year, we have expanded the mandate of the Entrepreneurship and Skills Development Centre to engage in critical activities to promote entrepreneurship training for both staff and students of the university,” he said.
