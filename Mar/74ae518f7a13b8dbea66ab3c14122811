A Federal High Court in Lagos has fixed March 29 for the hearing of litigation at the instance of a leading human right organisation which wants the Federal Government to revoke OPL 245 involving some oil conglomerates. The Human and Environmental Development Agenda, (HEDA), is raising issues of transparency and accountability in the issuance of oil operating license. R.A.O Adegoke and Aishat Odekunle, representing HEDA, asked the court to grant its request to probe into processes involving the license which HEDA said were flawed. HEDA’s counsel Adegoke   said all parties had been served their processes of which the  defendants had responded with their preliminary objections. The plaintiff equally filed its reply to all, hence, counsel to the defendant applied for a short date for the hearing of the matter.
