The Coalition of Domestic Observers and civil society organisations in Plateau State, yesterday, said the supplementary election that led to the emergence of Governor Simon Bako Lalong as winner was peaceful, fair and orderly. Addressing newsmen in Jos, the spokesman of the group, Godwin Okoko, said the elections across the state, adjudged to be the most peaceful and orderly state in Nigeria during the 2019 general elections, were “fair, peaceful and orderly”. Okoko, who appealed to all winners in the general elections to be magnanimous in victory to ensure a better, greater, secure and peaceful developed country, urged those dissatisfied with the outcome of the election to follow peaceful legal and constitutional means to seek redress. “We also appeal to the governor-elect, Barrister Simon Lalong as a leader of the state to begin the healing of wounds, closing of gaps, division and polarization through the processes of reconciliation irrespective of party affiliation. “We also encourage all good sons and daughters of the state to give a supportive hand to the governor-elect to ensure a stronger, developed, peaceful and united Plateau State,” he said. While commending the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the observers said counting and collation of results during the supplementary election were done transparently, peacefully and orderly as final results were pasted on designated areas in the polling units visited and where observers were stationed.
