Globacom has explained that its support for the 2019 Africa CEO Forum holding in Kigali, Rwanda, in two weeks’ time is informed by the potentiality of the medium to accelerate the continent’s economic prosperity. Globacom stated that with the event providing a huge platform for chief executives of African businesses to interact with other international investors and policy makers, it could not but throw its weight behind it as a forum meant to address the challenges facing regional development. The 2019 Africa CEO Forum is expected to champion private sector-led growth for the continent’s economy and transform the business outlook of the region. The two-day event will feature over 40 panel discussions, public-private workshops and case studies by business leaders, shareholders, investors, heads of state and ministers. The panels will discuss key challenges facing Africa’s private sector, including the “representation of top women executives in the boardroom and the modernization of family business governance”. “We share Africa CEO Forum’s objective of using regional integration to drive private sector growth and create more African champions,” Globacom said in its statement issued in Lagos on Thursday. As the 2019 Apex Diamond partner of the event, Globacom’s Executive Vice Chairman (EVC), Mrs. Bella Disu, will play a key role at the forum as she chairs the ‘Women in Business Initiative’ session. “This is part of our efforts to empower African businesses and spur economic growth in the region. Since we started operations in 2003, we have been in the forefront of promoting economic growth. We have continuously invested heavily in building reliable communication infrastructure to support economic freedom,” the company declared.
