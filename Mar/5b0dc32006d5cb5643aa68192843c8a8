The Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has allayed fears that facilities at the new international terminal of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Abuja would deteriorate. Mr Mahmud Sani, FAAN’s Regional General Manager, North Central and Abuja Airport Manager who gave the assurance said FAAN has put in place robust maintenance programme on the facility. Mr. Sani made the commitment in Abuja at the airport when Lufthansa moved its operations from the old international terminal to the new one commissioned December last year. Lufthansa is the sixth airline and the first European airline to move its operations to the new terminal. “For now we have six international airlines here and the other six are coming in between now and March 31,” he said. “We have Lufthansa; Ethiopian Airlines is on. We have Emirate, Air Côte d’Ivoire, Asky and Air Peace already using the faculty,” he said. The Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, who arrived on the flight said the new terminal was a manifestation of government’s commitment to the development of the country. “We have done the needful and we have emulated the good part of the world; we have joined them because this is what we see in Geneva and Frankfurt and so on,” he said. Mrs Winifred Oyo-Ita, Head of Service of the Federation, also said the mode of operations on arrival at the terminal, such as medical screening camera and immigration, was impressive.
