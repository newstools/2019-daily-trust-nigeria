The North Central Youths Coalition has urged Senator Abdullahi Adamu (APC, Nasarawa West) to throw in his hat for the Senate president’s seat race. In an interview with the Daily Trust in Minna, the president of the coalition, Alhaji Mohammed Inuwa, said Senator Adamu had the necessary pedigree to lead the 9th Senate, and called on the APC national leadership to zone the seat to the North Central. According to him, the former governor’s political journey and experience which started as far back as 1977, stood him out as the most qualified to occupy the position. “The Senate leadership at this point of transition, requires somebody of Senator Adamu’s experience, comportment and qualification. “His political journey started in 1977. He was elected to the Constituent Assembly, which drafted the constitution for Nigeria’s short-lived Second Republic (1979-1983).” He said all those who had shown interest in the race could not match the credentials of Senator Adamu. He added that Senator Adamu openly confronted and fought the likes of Bukola Saraki to a standstill.
