The Bauchi State chapter of a political group, South East Coalition for Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to declare the PDP candidate in the March 9th governorship election, Senator Bala Mohammed as winner. The group Chairman, Emeka Aneke Ekwueme, made the call in a statement in Bauchi while reacting to the recommendations made by the committee sent to Bauchi State by the INEC national headquarters. Ekwueme argued that, Bala was leading the APC with thousands of votes after results collated from almost all the local government areas in the state including Tafawa Balewa local government area whose results were rejected by the Commission. “Since there was no breach and violation of the Electoral Act or any law of the land at the Tafawa Balewa collation , the victory should be given to the  PDP candidate without waste of time because the candidate with the highest number of votes  is the candidate of the PDP, Bala Abdulkadir (Kauran Bauchi). “We are appealing to all Nigerians and all stakeholders in the Bauchi Project and we called on President Muhammadu Buhari and the INEC Chairman Professor Yakubu Mahmood to direct the Resident Electoral Commission (REC) to declare Senator Bala Mohammed winner since he scored the hugest number of votes in the said election,”he said. Chairman of the group noted that, declaring Bala Mohammed as the winner of the election will give the people of Bauchi State their choice.
