There was voters’ apathy at some polling units in Bwari Area Council and Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) during the chairmanship and councillorship election in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) today. Some INEC officials at polling unit 024, Gwarinpa Model School, said they were waiting for 2pm to collate the results as people fail to show up, unlike during the presidential and National Assembly election. One of the electorates, Chinedu Maxwell, said people failed to come out due to their belief that they do not have a stake in the area council elections. “I think the turnout is low. People don’t tend to have much stake in this election. They put a priority on presidency and National Assembly election,” he said. Another resident at polling unit 004 at Cittec Estate, AMAC said most people thought the election was local, hence the little importance attached to it. Kasinu Aliyu, in polling unit 003 LEA Primary School, Dutse in Bwari Area Council, said the turnout was poor. “People were coming but unlike the last election that they came at once, they are coming gradually,” he said.
