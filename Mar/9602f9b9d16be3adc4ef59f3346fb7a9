The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has rejected the governorship election results from Tafawa Balewa Local Government Area. The rejection stemmed from a complaint by the local government Returning Officer, Mrs. Dominion Anosike, who said the collation was done under duress and disrupted by thugs. According to her, they started collation at around 11pm and that hoodlums arrived around 3:00am, held them hostage and stole forms on which the results would be written. She noted that the election was held in a peaceful manner but lamented that the collation was disrupted. Both agents of PDP and APC also raised issues over the result. After hearing from both sides, the state Returning Officer, Prof. Mohammed Kyari after quoting relevant sections of the electoral law rejecting the results. “As far as I am concerned, there is no result for Tafawa Balewa,” he said. The results of Bauchi, Ganjuwa and Darazo local government areas are also yet to be announced.
