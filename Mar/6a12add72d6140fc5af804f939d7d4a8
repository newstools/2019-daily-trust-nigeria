The Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) has said Korean shipbuilding giant, Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI), has transformed Nigeria into a hub for fabrication and integration of Floating Production Storage Offloading (FPSO) unit in Africa. The Executive Secretary of NCDMB, Mr. Simbi Wabote, who stated this in Lagos on the local content milestones in Nigeria’s oil and gas industry, noted that the massive investment of SHI in Lagos is a major breakthrough in the implementation of local content in the country. According to him, the successful construction and local integration of the Egina FPSO in the company’s fabrication yard in Lagos was a key success story in the Nigerian content initiative. The Korean giant had set a new record on Nigerian content when it successful completed the FPSO unit, the largest floating oil platform in the world. A number of records were broken during construction as the project was the first ever to meet Nigeria’s demanding new standards for local content as attested to by the NCDMB. Of the 18 modules in the Egina, six were fabricated in the various fabrication yards across the country, and integrated locally in the company’s yard in Lagos, unlike the previous FPSOs, which were all fabricated and integrated outside the country.
