The Director General of the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC), Barrister Babatunde Irukera, alerted consumers about the need to consume fortified foods as they are beneficial to their health. He stated this at a sensitisation programme on food fortification organised by the commission in collaboration with Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) for Consumer Protection Associations (CPAs)/Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) held in Abuja, yesterday. Barrister Irukera said there is need for consumers to be aware of nutritional gaps in foods and deliberately seek for fortified foods to make up for the deficiencies. He said an estimated 468 million non-pregnant women and 293 million children suffer yearly from anemia and night blindness due to intake of foods that are deficient in iron and vitamins respectively. He also made specific reference to incidences of birth defects like spinal bifida, which is as a result of lack of intake of folic acid. He said the tripartite meeting of FCCPC, NAFDAC and SON was held recently to discuss ways of ensuring that food producers fortify to make up for deficient nutrients. He said a similar meeting has also been held with food producers to intimate them of their obligation and also the need to properly label food packages. The DG of FCCPC advised consumers to be health and nutrition conscious in their food selection and purchases to protect against the deficiencies.
