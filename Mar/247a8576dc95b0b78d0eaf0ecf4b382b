The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Lagos State said it was fully prepared for the conduct of governorship and State House of Assembly elections on Saturday. Daily Trust reports that 45 candidates of various political parties are contesting for the governorship election while 640 candidates are eyeing the 40 House of Assembly seats. Besides, there would be supplementary elections in 148 polling units of five local governments where elections for six House of Representatives seats were declared inconclusive. Spokesman of INEC in Lagos, Femi Akinbiyi in a chat with Daily Trust explained that in the polling units where there would be supplementary elections, the commission had made provision for three ballot boxes for governorship, House of Assembly and supplementary House of Representatives elections. He disclosed that all the election materials had been transported to the 20 local government areas in the state, saying activities had now shifted to each local government. From the LGs, he said the officials would move to the Registration Area Centres (RACs) where the ad-hoc staff would be retrained ahead of the elections. He also said that the commission had taken sufficient stock of the pitfalls experienced during the Presidential and National Assembly elections and put in place measures to avoid a repeat of such challenges. Akinbiyi explained that areas where there were security challenges and other identified flashpoints would be well policed for votes to carry out their civic duties in an atmosphere of peace and calmness.
