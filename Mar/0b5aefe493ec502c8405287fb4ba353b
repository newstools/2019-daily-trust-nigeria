Kwara APC governorship candidate, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has asked the PDP-led state government to stop victimising civil servants on flimsy and petty excuses. This was contained in statement issued by AbdulRazaq on Monday. AbdulRazaq’s statement followed social media report of a civil servant who was recently sacked by Kwara state government and others who were being threatened for not doing the alleged political bidding of the PDP-led government. “We are aware that civil servants who did not agree to do the bidding of the ruling PDP are being sacked or victimised in one way or the other. This is wrong, inhuman and unlawful. “Civil servants are humans and are covered by the social contract. Any government, such as the one currently in Kwara State, with no regard for the social contract cannot expect the civil servants to remain silent in the face of tyranny,” he said. The statement also said the state government has over the years politicised the civil service as the “discredited dynasty and patron to the government has a notorious history of coercing civil servants to support their candidates and suppress popular wishes of the electorate.” “Once elected, we will look into the cases of all the civil servants who were victimised or sacked on account of refusing to compromise their professionalism or integrity. We will restore their rights and dignity as Kwarans,” the statement quoted AbdulRazaq as saying. “It is outrageously hypocritical for a government that is notorious for coercing and blackmailing civil servants to do its political bidding to turn around and accuse civil servants of getting involved in politics,” the statement added.
