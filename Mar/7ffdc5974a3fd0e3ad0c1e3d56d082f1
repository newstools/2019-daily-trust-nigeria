The Kogi State Judiciary has been thrown into mourning following the death of a magistrate and deputy chief registrar (Litigation), Mr Zekery Aguye. Daily Trust learnt that Aguye died at the National Hospital, Abuja, after a protracted illness. The chief registrar of the state High Court, Mr. Yahaya Adamu, who confirmed Aguye’s demise yesterday, described him as one of the best hands in the state judiciary. He lamented that the inability of the deceased to continue to manage his health situation on account of non-payment of his salaries and allowances over the last nine months contributed to his demise. “I am very sorry to say that even as we subscribe to the will of Almighty Allah, who gives and takes life, you and I know certainly that sometimes there are deaths that are evitable. “In this particular one, we feel it may have been further delayed if we had continued to manage his ailment as we were doing in the past before the judiciary was financially grounded,” he said. On his part, the chairman of the Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria, Kogi State chapter, Emmanuel Waniko, said Aguye’s death “cannot be entirely divorced from the non-payment of judiciary workers’ salaries since July 2018 which now amounts to nine months.”  Stolen N21.6m inheritance...Runaway Kaduna court registrar extravagant, reveals colleague Judiciary in 16 states still paralysed Supreme Court confirms death of former CJN, Katsina-Alu
