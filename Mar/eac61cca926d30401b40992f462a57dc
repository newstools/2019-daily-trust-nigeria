Natives of the FCT, under the umbrella of the Original Inhabitants Youth Empowerment, have cautioned youth of the territory not to be used to cause violence  during Saturday, March 23 rerun chairmanship election in the territory. The president of the  group, Comrade Issac David,  made the call in a statement he issued to newsmen in Abuja yesterday. He  urged the youth  to be wary of politicians who usually relegated them to the dustbin of history when the elections were over. He said the youth must conduct themselves peacefully and protect their votes without any form of violence, noting that if they had conducted themselves in the previous election properly, there would not have been a rerun in the FCT. “It is also imperative to remind politicians that they are seeking the mandate of the people to govern and should never take it for granted. “The electoral process is an instrument of vertical accountability where such politician’s previous performance speaks for him without engaging in acts of violence, gerrymandering and intimidation,” the statement added.
