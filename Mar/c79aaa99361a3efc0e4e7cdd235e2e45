Ogun State Governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun on Monday admitted that his administration would not be able to complete the ongoing International Airport project at Wasimi, Ewekoro Local Government Area before expiration of his second term on May 29. He cited “time constraint” as reason for his inability to complete the project. In January, Amosun visited the site during his Senatorial campaign, promising that the airport’s runaway would be completed by May this year. Amosun who led the Executive Council members and Permanent Secretaries on inspection tour of some major projects in Abeokuta on Monday, foreclosed the completion of the airport project, saying, ‘’I will follow it up while in the Senate, though it is a Federal Government project.” He equally said he has assumed work fully following the outcome of the Saturday’s governorship election which did not favour his anointed successor and candidate of the Allied Peoples Movement (APM), Adekunle Akinlade. The outgoing governor vowed that he would not allow politics to slow down governance in the state. “Politics will not slow us down, as it is time to fully go back to work. The construction of the Ogun State Television (OGTV) Complex, Ogere International Market, the 250 bedded ultra-modern hospital, Abeokuta City Centre, new Makun City and other road projects would be completed and commissioned by President Muhammad Buhari in May this year,” he said.
