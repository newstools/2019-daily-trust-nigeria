The all-women board on the Vatican women’s magazine have resigned citing a campaign to discredit them and put them “under the direct control of men”. Founder Lucetta Scaraffia said pressure on staff at Women Church World had intensified after it had published reports about sexual abuse of nuns by other members of the clergy. The magazine comes as a monthly supplement in the Vatican daily paper. Her criticism was made in an open letter to Pope Francis.
