In the ongoing 9mobile promo in northern region, another winner of the N1m monthly draw has emerged from Kano for the months of March. Ali Ashiru Yahaya, a resident of Sheka Makaranta, in Kumbotso Local Government Area, Kano State, was the lucky winner, who received a cheque of one million naira from the officials of 9mobile during the presentation ceremony held today at the 9mobile regional office in Kano. Yahaya, who conducts business at the famous Farm Centre cell phones market in Kano, said he would use the money to boost his business so as to take good care of his family, including his aged parents. “I used to collect some used cell phones to sell and gain something out of it, that is what I have been doing for years. Now with this God given opportunity, I would use the money to acquire my own stand in the market and do my business,” he said. He expressed his gratitude to God for choosing him out of many to be the winner, and thanked 9mobile for keeping up to their words. Other prices were three cell phones won by Umar Abba of Sabon Titi, Dandago in Kano Municipal; Adam Kabir of Dausayi quarters in Gwale local government of Kano state and Alhaji Hassan Sani who came from Yankari in Bauchi State. Earlier in his welcome address, the Head, Regional sales, North region 2, Malam Babangida Muhammad Makaddas, said the promo was part of the 10th year anniversary of the existence of 9mobile in the north with the sole aim of rewarding loyal customers in the region. “Customers won recharge cards on daily basis, cell phones on weekly basis and N1m cash on monthly basis. Then there would be a grand price of a brand new car, which is coming up at the end of April,” he said.
