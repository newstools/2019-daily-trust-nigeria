The Osun State Elections Petitions Tribunal in Abuja had voided the cancellation of election in seven polling units in the Osun State governorship election. In the ruling read on behalf of a three-member panel of judges by Justice Peter Obi, the tribunal held that the returning officer of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had no powers to cancel the election in the seven polling units on September 22, 2018 leading to the rerun election on September 27, 2018, adding that he acted “ultra vires his powers.” Ademola Adeleke of the PDP had 254, 698 votes against Gboyega Oyetola of the APC with 254, 345 votes before the election was declared inconclusive. The rulings of the tribunal are part of the verdict of the ongoing tribunal in Abuja following the petition by the PDP and its governorship candidate, Adeleke challenging the outcome of the September, 2018 governorship election in Osun State.
