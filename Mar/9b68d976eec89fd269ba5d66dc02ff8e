The family, friends and political associates of the late House of Representatives member, Temitope Olatoye (ADP-Akinyele/Lagelu Federal Constituency of Oyo State) killed during the recent gubernatorial elections have demanded justice. Mr. Olajide Olatoye, the elder brother of the deceased, who addressed newsmen yesterday on behalf of the family, urged government and security agencies to ensure the killers were brought to book. “We really commend AIG Leye Oyebade of Zone II and CP Shina Olukolu of Oyo State for their prompt response and investigation of the killing which led to the arrest of some suspects. “I am very sure those arrested by the police were leaders of those who masterminded our son’s killing,” he said. He described what he called a campaign of calumny against the late lawmaker trending on the social media as mischief orchestrated by his political enemies. Dr Tunde Hamzat, the Special Adviser on Media and Strategy to the deceased, described him as an unadvertised philanthropist who was always willing to help people. He said that the late lawmaker was service personified as he devoted his life to the emancipation of the downtrodden and the Oyo State project. Hamzat also commended security agencies on their prompt investigation of the killing which led to some arrest, hoping Olatoye’s death would bring an end to high profile assassination in the country. Balogun Ajasa and Adewunmi Akeem, who were the late lawmaker’s landlords in Abeokuta, were also present at the press conference to dispel the negative rumour about the deceased.
