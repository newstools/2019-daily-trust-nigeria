A former governor of Borno State, Senator Ali Modu Sheriff has said that he could not go to his village in Ngala Local Government Area of the state for four years because of Boko Haram. Sheriff, who was a governor of Borno State between 2003-2011, told State House Correspondents of his inability to visit his town, after paying a congratulatory visit to president Muhammadu Buhari. He said the victory of president Buhari at the poll was for all Nigerians. “If you look at the antecedents of all the people that contested elections with President Buhari, none has 10 percent of his credibility. This is a man that is not interested in what every Nigerian is interested in, to grab wealth and enrich themselves. “He is there for the Nigerian people, he believes Nigeria should be better than where we are. He had very simple message at the campaigns, that we have started fighting corruption, building the economy and lives of Nigerians need to be improved. “The message resonated with Nigerians because for instance, I did not go to my village for four years before the 2015 elections. Boko Haram has occupied all our local government areas in Borno but today, you can drive to any part of Borno. “So whatever the people of Borno did for Mr. President last Saturday, we are only saying thank you for what he has done. If the atmosphere was clearer, Borno would have produced two million votes,” he said.
