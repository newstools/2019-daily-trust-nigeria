The People’s Democratic Movement (PDM) has filed a suit at the Federal High Court in Bauchi asking the court to declare its gubernatorial candidate as winner of Bauchi governorship election. The suit instituted by the party was over alleged non-inclusion of its logo on the Ballot Paper by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) during the elections. Speaking to journalists at the court premises in Bauchi on Tuesday, Counsel to the Plaintiff, Barrister  Auwal Idris Kwami said that they went to court and filed a suit against INEC on behalf of their client, the PDM, over non-inclusion of its party logo on the ballot paper. “We are now asking the court to cancel the election or in the alternative declare our client’s party as the winner of the Bauchi Governorship poll since our party was duly registered and we sponsored a candidate which we are very much convinced that our candidate should be returned elected. “We want the court to set aside the election conducted or in the alternative declare our candidate as winner of the election because it’s very fundamental to stick to adherence of section 138(d) of the Electoral Act,” he said. The counsel disclosed that they will pursue the case to its logical conclusion even if the electoral body declare somebody as winner of the election as the court will cancel the election in the interest of justice and fairness.
