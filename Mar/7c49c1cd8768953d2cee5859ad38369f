The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has said it would conduct fresh National Assembly elections in areas where the exercise could not hold last Saturday due to violence or other infractions. INEC National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, who said this in a statement Friday, said the elections would now be conducted on March 9 alongside the Governorship and State Assembly elections. This is as the INEC Director of Voter Education and Publicity, Mr. Oluwole Osaze-Uzzi, said the supplementary election is only for National Assembly seats in such Senatorial Districts and Federal Constituencies where no declaration and return had been made. He said that it does not involve the Presidential election or other elections where results have been declared and returns of winners made. Okoye’s statement was the outcome of a marathon meeting of the INEC management with the state Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) to review last Saturday’s elections and perfect plans for next Saturday’s Governorship, State Houses of Assembly and FCT Area Council elections.
