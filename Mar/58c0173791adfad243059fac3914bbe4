The Kano State chapter of Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) is set to challenge Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje in court over his victory in the gubernatorial election. The state’s chairman of the coalition, Alhaji Muhammad Abdullahi Raji, stated this while addressing journalists on the outcome of the rerun election that gave victory to Dr. Ganduje of APC. Raji said the coalition, comprising 42 political parties, had concluded arrangement to take legal action regarding the election. He said: “Thuggery and vote-buying were reported in almost all the polling units where the re-run was conducted. There were also reports of loss of lives and other election malpractices under the watch of INEC and security officials. “It is evident that INEC and security agencies were compromised. The level of violence recorded during the March 9, gubernatorial election that led to the cancellation of some polling units is far less than what was recorded during the 23rd March rerun poll, yet the electoral body turned a blind eye on the happenings by accepting and announcing the results,” he said. The CUPP chairman, therefore, faulted the declaration of Dr. Ganduje as winner of the rerun election, lamenting that the poll was marred by irregularities and electoral fraud committed before, during and after the process.
