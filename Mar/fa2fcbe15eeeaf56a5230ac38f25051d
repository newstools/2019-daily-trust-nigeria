A candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) contesting for Jos North/North constituency at the Plateau state house of assembly, Barrister Munir Barau has said he intends to work on Free Girl-Child Education  & Vigilante Welfare bill. Barau told Daily Trust in Jos on Tuesday that nothing in his constituency is working as public schools, roads and hospitals were comatose. He said he wants to be “a lawmaker in order to provide quality service and effective representation for his constituents”. Barau who is also the Campaign Coordinator of Plateau state gubernatorial candidate of PDP, Jeremiah Useni for Jos North local government said: “I want to sponsor bill where vigilantes in Plateau state would be receiving some stipends when elected as a member representing Jos North/North constituency.” “Vigilantes have risked their lives in securing our communities in the state and they need to be rewarded, so I will sponsor bill that would enable them to be paid allowances.” Barau also added that he would also sponsor a bill that would provide free education for the girls, “this bill would be provided with free educational materials from nursery enrollment to the completion of secondary school,” Barau, who has been practising Law for the past 15 years boasted that he has what it takes to represent his constituency. He said, “I have a Diploma in Accountancy, Degree and Masters in Business Studies. I also have a degree and Masters in Law and currently doing my PhD in Law at University of Jos. So my level of education would make me to serve well as lawmaker.” ‘Munir deserves to be member representing Jos N/North’ Meet the youngest Plateau House of Assembly candidate Jos market bombings Death toll rises to 122
