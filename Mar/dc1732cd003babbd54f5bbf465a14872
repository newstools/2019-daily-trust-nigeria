An election monitoring group under the auspices of the Centre for Transparency Advocacy (CTA) has predicted low turnout in todayâ€™s elections. According to the group, many eligible voters might stay away because of the prominent role security agencies may play in the electoral process, especially militarization of the polls. The Executive Director, CTA, Faith Nwadishi, said yesterday in Abuja that if this scenario played out, it may also negate the essence of the people electing leaders of their choice in a peaceful and natural setting. According to her, in the recent presidential and National Assembly elections, security personnel were fingered in cases of deaths involving INEC staff and voters. She lamented the abduction of Returning Officers, Collation Officers and political party agents, noting the most scandalous of which is the case of the abduction of Prof Ibeabuchi by thugs and persons in army uniform to hold him hostage for hours and force him to announce results against his will. She also cited political violence and disruption of voting in many states including Lagos which also led to disenfranchisement of many intending voters, and threats to voters if they vote for or against a particular political party.
