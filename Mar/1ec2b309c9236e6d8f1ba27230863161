A former governor of Oyo State Otunba Christopher Adebayo Alao-Akala, on Friday night, announced his defection to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). He said his decision to re-align his political structure with the government at the federal level was for national interest. Akala, who stated this in a statement he personally signed, said he was approached by the presidency to work with the gubernatorial candidate of APC in the state, which he considered as a privilege for the people of Oyo State. He noted that he decided to work with the candidate of the ruling party because the opposition party refused to present him as a consensus candidate for the opposition parties. The statement reads: “Following the outcome of the just concluded presidential and national assembly elections, I, Otunba Christopher Adebayo Alao-Akala…have decided to form an alliance with the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Adebayo Adekola Adelabu ahead of the March 9th Governorship and state House of assembly Elections in the state. “However, all the ADP candidates for the House of Assembly seats will go to the elections with my maximum supports.
