An Iraqi court has issued a warrant for the arrest on corruption charges of the former governor of Nineveh province after a ferry sinking in Mosul. Parliament voted on Sunday to sack Nawfal al-Akoub as a consequence of last week’s accident in the River Tigris that killed almost 100 people. On Wednesday, Nineveh’s investigations court said he and several other officials were suspected of misusing their powers and wasting public money. Mr Akoub has so far not commented. The ferry accident sparked protests by residents, who demanded those responsible be held to account. The ferry was transporting families to a tourist area on Umm Rabaen island in the Tigris on Thursday when it started to take on water and then overturned.
