The wife of Kebbi State Governor, Dr. Zainab Bagudu has paid for the release of a nursing mother who was serving a seven-month jail term in one of the prisons in the state. The woman was jailed when she could not afford to pay the fine of N15000 imposed by the court for fighting her neighbour at Gungun Maje village in Bunza area of the state. The Governor’s wife also donated a grinding machine to the woman and placed her on an allowance. Dr.  Zainab also paid the fine for a total of 78 prisoners who were convicted of minor offences and were given an option of fine. She said she chose to mark the successful re-election of President Buhari, Governor Bagudu and all APC candidates with the humanitarian gesture. She said she was collaborating with the state branches of the Nigerian Bar Association and Federation of Female lawyers for the release of the prisoners. She advised the released prisoners to use the skills they learnt in the prison to have positive impact on the society and enjoined members of their communities to facilitate their quick reintegration. The State Comptroller of Prisons, Mamuda Mato, said the prison has a population of 390 inmates. Speaking on behalf of the inmates, Sani  Ubandoma, pleaded with the state government to set up a prerogative of mercy committee to consider freeing some of them.
