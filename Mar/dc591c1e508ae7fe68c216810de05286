Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, yesterday, called on youth not to allow any politician to use them to create violence for whatever selfish reason. Ortom made the remark while addressing newsmen in Makurdi on the outcome of the just concluded presidential and National Assembly elections in the state. “The election was relatively peaceful, free and fair. Though not 100 per cent because there were issues. But I thank INEC, security agencies for being professional. The state is really happy with the outcome of the results and that demonstrates what democracy is all about,” he said. The governor noted that once the wishes of people were allowed to prevail, everyone would be happy, stressing that he was happy with the results.
