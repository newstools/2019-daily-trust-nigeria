Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has pledged to create “the world’s largest minimum income scheme” if his party wins election. He said the Congress Party would guarantee an income for 50 million of India’s poorest families. Mr Gandhi called it a “fiscally prudent” scheme that would “eliminate poverty”. But the governing BJP said India’s poor was receiving more support under existing schemes. “If you are sure about your defeat, you can promise [the] moon,” party general secretary Ram Madhav tweeted.
