The Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) has alleged that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) was forcing the Deputy Director General (administration) of the PDP presidential campaign council, Kabiru Tanimu Turaki, SAN, to surrender the evidence that the presidential candidate of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar, intended to use at the tribunal. Atiku had inaugurated a legal team few days ago to challenge the outcome of the February 23 presidential election in which INEC declared candidate of the APC, President Muhammadu Buhari as winner. But the EFCC last Monday, arrested Turaki, a former Minister of Special Duties, who the PDP said has the list of witnesses Atiku intended to call to testify in court and alleged that the EFCC was doing everything possible to force Turaki to submitting the witnesses list and evidence against the APC. In a statement on Tuesday in Abuja, the spokesman of the CUPP, Ikenga Ugochinyere said, “EFCC team moves to cart away documents and evidences for Atiku’s case against Buhari to derail the petition filing and damage some of the incriminating evidences for proving electoral frauds in the possession of arrested deputy DG. “The learned Senior Advocate only went to the EFCC office in connection to the signing of bail papers for other Atiku associates who are in custody. “The mode of his arrest and detention clearly shows it was upon a spontaneous realization that he was a coordinating factor in the expected legal challenge of the rigged Presidential election of 23rd February. “How can there be peace where the people’s mandate was brazenly stolen? How can there be peace when barriers are consistently being mounted against the victim of Executive theft so that he cannot seek redress in court?” EFCC arrests PDP campaign deputy DG, Turaki EFCC arrests PDP campaign deputy DG, Turaki 2019: Turaki declares for presidency
