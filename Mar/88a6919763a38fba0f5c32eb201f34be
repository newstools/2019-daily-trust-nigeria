The Dispute Resolution Centre (DRC) of Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) has set up a committee of stakeholders to resolve disputes between government contractors and vendors. This is contained in a statement signed by Chief Emeka Obegolu, the Chairman of Dispute Resolution Centre. He said the move became necessary in order to check the perennial issues of abandonment of projects and cost overrun. The stakeholders include the Federal Ministry of Justice, Ministry of FCT, Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Bureau of Public Procurement and Federal Ministry of Works and Housing. Others were the Institute of Chartered Mediators and Conciliators, Nigerian Bar Association and JICAM, amongst others. They met on February 28, 2019, under the auspices of the Stakeholders Committee on Government Contract Dispute Resolution. He said the Committee will soon hold a National Workshop to brainstorm and address how disputes arising from government contracts can be resolved speedily.
