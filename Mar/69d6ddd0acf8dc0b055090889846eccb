Dangote tomato processing factory, the largest such plant in Africa, yesterday, begun production at its Kadawa factory in Kano. Addressing newsmen at the factory’s conference hall after a tomato processing process tour, the Managing Director of Dangote tomato processing plant, Malam Abdulkareem Kaita, stated that, the 1,200tons per day capacity plant has begun production after concluding all necessary arrangements for a successful takeoff this season. He said the company has reached agreement with tomato farmers on the pricing of tomato hence pricing posed no threat to the company’s production as it uptakes from the farmers. “We have reached an agreement with the three stakeholders in tomato production. We have resolved to offer what the open markets offer subject to review every two days and I am happy that the growers have been cooperating because we have since started. “It will interest you to know that the company has made commitment to adhere to the agreement reached and also hope to have a hitch free business season between us,” said Kaita. He said Dangote Tomato Processing Company offered the safest paste for consumption as it is 100% pure tomato, adding that to complement the company’s effort in tomato paste production, there is a strong need for the authorities concerned to step-up on the policy that bans paste importation. “The Federal Government has done well in formulation of the policy that bans tomato paste importation, but there is still need for it to do more in enforcing the policy; this will no doubt assist the farmers and the company to produce more,” he also noted.
