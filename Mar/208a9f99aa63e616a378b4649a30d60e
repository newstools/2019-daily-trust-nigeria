A South African preacher has tried to confront another pastor for “bringing Christianity into disrepute” by staging a bogus resurrection. Self-styled prophet Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng stood outside the locked gates of Pastor Alph Lukau’s church and shouted “I’m here to get answers”. He said if the pastor really had the power to resurrect, they should head over to Nelson Mandela’s grave. A video showing the ‘resurrection’ was widely mocked. It shows Mr Lukau shouting “rise up” to a man lying in a coffin who then jerks upright to cheers from worshippers. Funeral companies say they were manipulated into being involved.
