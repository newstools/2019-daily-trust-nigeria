The Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) and the Nigeria LNG Limited (NLNG) will today in Abuja sign the Nigerian Content Plan (NCP) for NLNG’s Train 7 project, estimated to cost $1bn. The Executive Secretary of NCDMB, Engr. Simbi Kesiye Wabote and the Managing Director of NLNG, Engr. Tony Attah, met at the board’s headquarters in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, yesterday and finalised arrangements for the signing ceremony. The Train 7 project is expected to ramp up NLNG’s production capacity by 35 per cent from 22 Million Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA) to 30 MTPA. A statement from NCDMB said the Nigerian Content Plan sets out the work scopes to be executed in-country in each project, based on the provisions of the Nigerian Content Act and existing capacities. The document would form the operating guide for project execution and monitoring.
