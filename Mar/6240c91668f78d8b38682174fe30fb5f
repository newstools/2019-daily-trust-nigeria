Former governor of Akwa Ibom State and senator representing Akwa Ibom North West Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Godswill Akpabio, has submitted his petition to the election tribunal in Uyo. Akpabio, who is seeking to reclaim what he called stolen mandate during the National Assembly elections, said yesterday that he had submitted his petition to seek validation of the senatorial results. Speaking through his media aide, Anietie Ekong, Akpabio said his counsel submitted the petitions on Saturday to the panel sitting at the High Court in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State. The APC candidate during the senatorial elections is seeking an order of the tribunal to upturn the victory of Mr Christopher Ekpenyong, the PDP candidate on allegations of  electoral irregularities during the elections. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had declared Ekpenyong of the PDP, winner of the polls with 118,215 votes against Akpabio’s 83,158 votes. But while the election was still ongoing, Akpabio was said to have stormed the INEC office in Uyo with complaints of alleged infractions and deliberate violation of the electoral laws and guidelines during the polls. “Incontrovertible result sheets from the Independent National Electoral Commission office in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, showed different figures that I secured 138,256 votes as against Ekpeyong’s 123,843 votes. “We are not satisfied with the results and outcome of that election, that is why the former governor and the party approached the election petitions tribunal to ventilate their grievances as well as reclaim their stolen mandate,” Akpabio said. 2019 polls: Akpabio seeks to reclaim mandate, submits petition to Tribunal Outrage trails tribunal''s ruling on Akwa Ibom North-West How Akpabio rigged Akwa Ibom elections, by witness
