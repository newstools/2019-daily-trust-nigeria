The All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, in Nasarawa State is organising a one-day peaceful protest over alleged rigging of the just concluded governorship election in the state. A former Minister of Communication and Governorship candidate of APGA in the state, Mr. Labaran Maku, who was defeated at the polls, said that, “APGA would organise a one-day peaceful protest over alleged rigging of the just concluded governorship election in the state. “I decided to invite my supporters across the state to thank them for their support during the electioneering campaign. I call on other opposition parties and lovers of democracy in the state to join hands with APGA during the planned protest against electoral fraud in the state. “I want to tell you that I have won my election just as I won my election in 2015, but we were rigged out. The election was marred by irregularities perpetrated by the INEC in collusion with some security agents to favour the opposition. Card readers were not used at all in some areas so as to perfect their plans as a ward in the state presented 80,000 votes in favour of APC candidate, this is rigging.” Maku was speaking in his residence in Wakama Town of Nassarawa Eggon Local Government area on Monday (today). He called on lovers of democracy in the state and his supporters to remain committed and firm towards defending democracy in the state. It could be recalled that INEC declared that Abdullahi Sule of APC polled 327,229 votes to defeat other governorship opponents in the election. Mr David Ombugadu of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) scored 184,281 votes, while Mr Labaran Maku of the APGA polled 132,784 votes.
