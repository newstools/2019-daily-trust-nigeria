The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON), Mr. Ahmed Lawan Kuru, has called on parents to educate the girl child to enable them compete with their male counterparts in the financial services industry and other fields of employment hitherto dominated by men. Kuru stated this while addressing staff at a brief ceremony to mark the International Women’s Day (IWD) at the corporate head office of the corporation in Abuja recently. A statement by AMCON said Kuru, who was represented by AMCON’s Executive Director, Operations, Mr. Aminu Ismail, noted that the financial services industry is fast expanding, just as the population is growing, meaning that over the next decade there would be critical need for skilled professionals in the sector, and that women must play a significant role in ensuring that these needs are effectively met. “Nigeria is a big market for financial services and as the most populous country in Africa, it is also the choice investment destination for forward-looking investors. “From projections, the country in the years ahead would require professionals in all aspects of financial services and it is my wish that we have increased women participation in the sector. It is not accidental that the theme for this year’s International Women’s Day is ‘Balance for Better’,” Kuru said.
