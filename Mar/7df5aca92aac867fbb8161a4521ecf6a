The National Chairman of Accord Party, Mallam Muhammadu Lawal Nalado, has said that Chief Dumo Lulu-Briggs remained the party’s governorship candidate in next Saturday’s governorship election in Rivers State. Nalado told newsmen on Friday, in Abuja, that Mr. Precious Baridoo was never a candidate of the party as he was not even an aspirant, let alone fulfilling other requirements to participate in the party’s primaries that produced Lulu-Briggs. A Federal High Court, sitting in Port Harcourt and presided over by Justice E.A. Obile, had sacked Chief Lulu-Briggs as the Rivers State governorship candidate for Accord Party, on the grounds that he was not the authentic candidate for the party. But Nalado said they were shocked by the judgement and has appealed the ruling. According to him, their attention was drawn to a press statements issued recently by the party’s former state chairman in Rivers State Chapter Mr. Precious Baridoo that Accord had endorsed the Governor of Rivers State Chief Nyesom Wike as the party’s gubernatorial candidate for the coming governorship election. He said Mr. Baridoo was a mole to destabilize the party and denied it the expected victory.
