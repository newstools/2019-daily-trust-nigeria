Sokoto State Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal yesterday assured the people of the state that he will not be dictated to by anybody in his second term. “I will run a cabal free government,” he said, while interacting with journalists in Sokoto. He said that the victory figure of 342 would never escape his memory. “It is God’s work considering what happened during the election,” he said. He pledged to work assiduously to justify the renewed confidence in his government by the people of the state. He denied receiving any calls from Senator Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko and the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Ahmed Aliyu, congratulating him on his re-election.. He extended a hand of fellowship to them, saying their support was needed in developing the state. He said that his government was the first in the history of the state to appoint three female commissioners, eight female permanent secretaries and three female  counsellors in each of the 23 local government areas. He added that his government was spending N120 million on the procurement of water treatment chemicals monthly. Tambuwal said his government was working with the Sultanate Council, community leaders and security agencies to address banditry in the state.
