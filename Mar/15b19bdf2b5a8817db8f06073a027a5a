A coalition of INEC accredited Domestic Election Observers monitoring elections in Bauchi state has commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), political parties, security agencies and voters in the state for their readiness  for the Governorship and state House of Assembly elections. The commendation was contained in a communiqué signed by the Coalition’s team leader, Comrade Friday Maduka. Addressing journalists in Bauchi on Thursday, Maduka said security agencies in the‎ state were able to put up a strong structure in place which helped in protecting lives and properties during the presidential and National Assembly elections. According to him, the level ‎of voter’s awareness and mobilisation by stakeholders like the media, political parties, NGOs and others have enlightened the electorate and made them ready for the elections. “The Bauchi state electorates are fully ready‎ for the elections as over 70% of them have already collected their PVCs and wish to use same for elections. “We noted that the INEC is resolute, transparent and committed to conducting credible free election,” he said. The observers called on Nigerians to be patient with INEC as it faces frustrating challenges which led to the postponement of the Presidential and National Assembly elections. “INEC, having assured ‎Nigerians and the global community of credible, transparent, free, fair elections come 23rd of February, 2019 and 9th of March, 2019, we should all support them to actualise it for the good of all. “Finally, we urge our entire colleagues coming to observe the elections in Bauchi state and other election duty officials not to be afraid; Bauchi is safe and peaceful. There is no cause for alarm for running out of the state for fear of election violence.” Election violence: The Red, Yellow and Blue alert zones — Prof Ujo Yuguda canvasses security for corpers In Bauchi, it’s litmus test for democracy
