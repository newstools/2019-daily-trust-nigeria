The APC Caretaker Committee in Ogun State has warned commercial banks and other financial institutions against granting Governor Ibikunle Amosun’s loan request barely two months to the expiration of his term. A statement issued, yesterday, in Abeokuta by the spokesman of the committee, Tunde Oladunjoye, said  any institution that granted such requests “does so at its own risk”. The statement read: “It has come to our notice that the outgoing governor has been exerting pressures on banks and financial institutions to grant frivolous loans, overdrafts and other instruments immediately Prince Dapo Abiodun was declared Governor-Elect…. “As for the banks, we want to state categorically that the incoming administration believes so much in the rule of law and due process. Therefore, the administration will not honour any obligation that did not follow due process or any loans that did not receive the prior approval of the State House of Assembly.” Don't grant Amosun's last minute loan request, Ogun APC tells banks Assembly approves Amosun’s N65.7bn loan request Why Kaduna’s $350m loan request is delayed in Senate
