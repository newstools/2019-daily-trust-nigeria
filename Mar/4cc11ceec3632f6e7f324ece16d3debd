Moves by the retired General Abdulsalami Abubakar-led National Peace Committee to stop the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from challenging the outcome of last Saturday’s presidential election in court may have hit the rocks. The committee on Thursday met with Atiku Abubakar and his running mate, Peter Obi as well as other top PDP leaders in Abuja, to prevail on them to stop the idea of challenging President Muhammadu Buhari at the tribunal. But the PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, has said no one can stop the party from challenging the outcome of the election in court, adding that the party has evidence to prove that the election was rigged in favour of the APC. Secondus who addressed a press conference yesterday in Abuja, alongside members of the party’s National Working Committee (NWC) said the party and its presidential candidate were determined to battle in court until justice was done.
