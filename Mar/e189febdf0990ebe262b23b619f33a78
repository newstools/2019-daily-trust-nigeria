A 67-years old man was among 14 suspects paraded on Tuesday evening in Port Harcourt, Rivers state by the 6 Division of the Nigerian Army for offences bordering on electoral violence. This has brought to 67, the number of suspects arrested by the Division for various electoral offences during the Presidential and National Assembly elections in the state.
