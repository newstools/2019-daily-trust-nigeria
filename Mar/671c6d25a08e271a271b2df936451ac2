Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro has provoked controversy by posting an obscene video of two revellers at Carnival, saying he wanted to reveal the truth about the festival. The clip posted on Twitter shows two men engaging in sex acts on top of a taxi shelter during a street party. The far-right leader suggested such scenes were becoming normal. Critics say he is targeting the Carnival and the gay community in retaliation for protests against him. Mr Bolsonaro, who has made racist, homophobic and misogynistic remarks but was a clear winner in last year’s election, was the focus of much criticism in many Carnival celebrations across Brazil.
