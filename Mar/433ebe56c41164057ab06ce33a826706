The Lagos State governor-elect, Babajide Sanwo-Olu of the APC, has dedicated his victory to all the residents in the state even as he pledged to provide jobs, build infrastructure and meet people’s basic needs. Sanwo-Olu gave the assurance at the first briefing after he was announced the winner of the Saturday’s election. The governor-elect confirmed that he received a call from his main challenger, Jimi Agbaje of the PDP, at about 7:05pm who, according to him, conceded defeat and  wished him well. Sanwo-Olu said the election was actually a referendum on how the people wanted to be defined and whether the people wanted growth and development or they should be fighting one another. He said the people’s choice has indeed demonstrated that they chose wisely. “Those who wanted to use tribe to divide us would be disappointed by the outcome of this election. And to all who participated in this election whatever you said or did during the election is forgotten.  It is time to put aside all insignificant differences and  put all hands together, “ he said. He said his administration  would be pre-occupied with how to move Lagos further to greater height. He said he was convinced that it was just him that the people voted but also the message of greater Lagos he preached and which resonated with people.
