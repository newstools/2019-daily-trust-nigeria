The governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, has not been sacked, a senior management staff from the apex bank confided in our reporter on Monday. According to the source who craved anonymity, the claim making the rounds that the CBN Governor has been sacked is not true. Several online media have been awashed with news of the sack of Emefiele by the federal government, barely 4 months to the end of his tenure. In a telephone conversation with our reporter on Monday evening, the source said: “I can confirm to you that he has not been sacked. He is in his office this minute attending to matters as the Governor. We don’t know where this rumour is coming from and we don’t understand what it is meant to achieve.” Godwin Emefiele: Enter another player turned referee No more chartered flights for CBN staff – Emefiele CBN threatens to  withhold CRR from commercial banks
