The Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Hon. Mudashiru Obasa, has hailed the leadership qualities of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, describing him as the greatest politician of the present generation. Obasa, rejoicing with Asiwaju Tinubu yesterday on his 67th birthday celebration, said the former Lagos State governor’s “leadership qualities and ability to discover and nurture talents for the greater good of the public are uncommon and unrivalled among his peers.” In the Speaker’s message released by his Chief Press Secretary, Musbau Rasak, he said, “But for the special discovery talent of Asiwaju, great administrators like Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; former Osun State governor, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola; Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Mr Babatunde Raji Fashola and Gov Akinwunmi Ambode wouldn’t have had the opportunity to show Nigerians and the world at large the stuff they are made of.” Obasa also praised what he called the pioneering efforts of Asiwaju Tinubu in the creation of modern Lagos, which he said has become the role model for others in the country to emulate. “He’s the architect of modern Lagos, laying the solid foundation on which successful governments continue to build on and making the state the best among its peers in the country and the continent,” the Speaker maintained.
