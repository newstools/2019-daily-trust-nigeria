Former Governor of Adamawa State, Boni Haruna has hailed the effort of the Nigerian Army as well other security agencies over their prompt and gallant response to Boko Haram attacks in his community, Michika. Boko Haram insurgents on Monday attacked Michika town, the headquarters of Michika Local Government Area of Adamawa State barely few days to the supplementary election, but the Nigerian Army in a gallant response quelled the uprising by neutralizing the terrorists who came in their numbers. Mr Haruna in a statement signed personally by him said “It is quite worrisome for Michika to once again experience such attack when the people had almost settled to rebuild their lives after the 2014 invasion during which the area and indeed the entire Northern part of the state was overran by the insurgents. “I take this opportunity to condole with the people, particularly the families of those who lost their beloved ones most of whom were hit by stray bullets in the course of running for their dear lives. I pray for the quick recovery of the injured ones and for the restoration of the losses that have been incurred. “In the midst of this tragic event and the pains and agonies that come with it, I urge all our people to remain calm and steadfast. This sad moment shall also pass as we look into the future with hope and determination” “I wish to most profoundly commend the Nigerian army and other security agencies for the their prompt and gallant response to the attack in Michika, my community yesterday by suspected Boko Haram insurgents,” he added.
