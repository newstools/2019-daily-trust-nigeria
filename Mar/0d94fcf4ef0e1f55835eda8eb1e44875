Senegal’s President Macky Sall has won a second term of five years, following Sunday’s election. He took 58% of the vote in the poll in which he faced four challengers, but was accused of preventing some of his main rivals from running. Two well-known opposition figures were barred from taking part because of corruption convictions. The opposition candidates have rejected the results, but say a court challenge would be futile. Idrissa Seck, a former prime minister who came second with 21% of the votes, discussed the results at his home with the three other opposition candidates. Mr Sall was first elected in 2012. On the campaign trail, he focused on his record with infrastructure projects. SENEGAL: Macky Sall faces 4 challengers in polls As Ouattara begins second term Senegal's Karim Wade jailed for corruption
