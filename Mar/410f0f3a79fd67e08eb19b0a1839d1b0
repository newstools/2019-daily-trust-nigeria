Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) has reiterated its commitment to providing meter to customers to ensure energy accountability and assured payment for energy by its customers. The company also said it will continue to support the Meter Asset Provider (MAP) initiative of the Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) as it has potential to provide succour for customers on meter provision. The Managing Director/CEO of AEDC, Engr. Ernest Mupwaya restated the commitment when he hosted the Chairman of Meron Ltd, a MAP firm during a meter contract review meeting in Abuja. Mupwaya said studies by AEDC show that the company loses more revenue from areas of low meter density. “For us in AEDC, this remains a major part of our business plan as it speaks to our overall transformation agenda in the area of service delivery,” he added. Meanwhile, AEDC is spending N7 million to rehabilitate the Uke/Masaka 33 kilovolt (kV) power lines to evacuate excess capacity available at 30MVA and 60MVA transmission substation in Keffi, Nasarawa state. It said the facility belonging to the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) is currently delivering below 30 percent from which the excess can be used by AEDC. AEDC spokesman, Oyebode Fadipe in a statement said on completion, 20 megawatts (MW) of power will be evacuated from Keffi to bring some relief to customers in Masaka, Mararaba, One Man Village, Auta Balefi and environs. It said the affected areas currently suffer about 53MW capacity insufficiency and have their power rationed due to capacity limitation at the 120MVA TCN substation in Karu, Abuja.
