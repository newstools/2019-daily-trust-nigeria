A Lagos High Court, sitting at Igbosere, has sentenced a new generation church pastor to two years imprisonment for forgery. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had charged the pastor, Olalekan Oregunwa, along with Netstock Broking Firm, with stealing and forgery. The EFCC said Oregunwa committed the offence sometime in 2008 in Lagos by fraudulently converting various sums of money entrusted to him by some of his clients to his own use. The Commission said that on or about January 21, 2008, the convict stole and fraudulently converted the sum of N950,000, which the complainant, Bassey Praise Ita, entrusted to him for the purchase of Regency Alliance shares. Oregunwa appealed to Justice M. Obadina to temper justice with mercy because he was a first-time offender. The court was informed that the accused was the only bread winner for his young family because his wife had no job. The court was further informed that he was remorseful and had, in fact, started paying back the money involved. Pronouncing the sentence, Obadina said the court had considered the fact that Oregunwa had started paying back the money.
