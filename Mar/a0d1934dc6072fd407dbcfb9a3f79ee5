The son of the former Angolan president has been released from prison, where he was being held on charges of embezzlement. José Filomeno dos Santos had been detained for seven months. He was accused of attempting to steal $1.5bn (£1.1bn) when he was head of Angola’s sovereign wealth fund. He was appointed to that role in 2013 by his father, who was president at the time. But he was sacked last year by current President João Lourenço who came to power in 2017. On Friday, prosecutors announced they had recovered all the financial and other assets of the Angolan sovereign wealth fund. Mr dos Santos’ lawyer said the legality of his client’s detention had expired weeks ago.
