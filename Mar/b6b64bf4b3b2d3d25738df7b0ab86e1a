Lagos state governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, has hailed the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, for his political dexterity, doggedness, undoubted courage and political acumen. He said these attributes played key part in the electoral victory of APC at the just concluded 2019 general elections. Governor Ambode, who spoke at the 11th Bola Tinubu Colloquium held on Thursday at the International Conference Centre, Abuja as part of activities marking the 67th birthday of Tinubu saluted the role played by the APC national leader in the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. He said Nigeria was already on threshold of greatness with the duo in the next level government. A statement issued by the Governor’s chief press secretary, Habib Aruna quoted Ambode as saying the next level promised by the APC government was already unfolding, adding that the next four years would engender massive development and service to the people. “We are all expectant and we can feel the next level unfolding. Our country is on the threshold of greatness because for the first time since our independence, we would have successive administrations of a progressive and visionary government; a government of integrity, a government whose sole interest is the well-being of Nigeria and Nigerians,” “We are here not only to celebrate Tinubu but to celebrate the incoming dawn in Nigeria; we are here to celebrate the next level in Nigeria where Nigerians will be served and given what is due to them,” Ambode said. While describing the theme of the colloquium: ‘Next Level: Work For People’ as perfectly conceived and apt for the moment, Ambode said it was instructive that it was coming at a time when Nigerians were eagerly looking forward to revolutionary transformation in key sectors and sections of the country. “This colloquium is coming at a time when the APC has spread its political tentacles even further in the country and a time when Nigerians are eagerly looking forward to the next level in progressive politics, economic growth, social welfare and increased national security,” he added.
