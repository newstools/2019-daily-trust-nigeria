He stated this in a speech after he was declared winner of the governorship election in the state. “As we celebrate this hard-earned triumph, I am humbled that you have found me worthy of your trust and confidence. I accept this responsibility with humility and I truly understand its meaning, namely, that you expect me to be a servant of the people, and to lead the charge for the restoration of hope over despair and good over evil,” he said. According to him, “At the core of this mandate is the crucial drive to give Bauchi State citizens a better prospect and greater opportunity for a prosperous life; reducing poverty and empowering our citizens in the areas of agriculture, Education, urban and rural infrastructure among others,” he said. He commended the members of his party, the PDP and others for their support which he said ensured his victory in the elections. Senator Bala particularly commended the Speaker, House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, Alhaji Bello Kirfi, community and religious leaders ‎for standing for the will of the people. “I must also thank the coalition that emerged from various political parties that wholeheartedly endorsed and supported my candidature, as well as numerous professional unions, civil society organisations, women and youth groups,” he added.
