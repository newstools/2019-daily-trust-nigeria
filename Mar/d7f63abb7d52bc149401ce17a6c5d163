The Kwara State House of Assembly has named the complex housing offices of members after its pioneer speaker, Alhaji Shehu Usman, who was also the late Ciroma of Lafiagi. Usman, who served as speaker between 1979 and 1983, died onÂ  Nov. 26, 2018 at the age of 77. The decision to name the office complex in his honour followed a pledge made by the Speaker, Dr. Ali Ahmad, during the valedictory session held in honour of the late speaker on December 6, 2018. Ahmad, who described the late lawmaker as a charismatic leader that led a rancour- free life and provided guidance to upcoming leaders, also called on the state government to immortalize him.
