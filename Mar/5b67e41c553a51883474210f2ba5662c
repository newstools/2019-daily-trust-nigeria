The village chiefs in Abaji Area Council have said the re-election of the incumbent council chairman, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, for a second term is well-deserved. The Etsu of Rimba community, Alhaji Abubakar Muhammad Jiya, while speaking when he led other village chiefs on a congratulatory visit to the chairman at his private residence in the area on Wednesday, said the chairman’s victory at the polls was a result of his hard work and selfless service to the entire people of the area. He added that the chairman’s good leadership quality and compassion for the less privileged and the downtrodden earned him the victory. “We are also praying that after your tenure, may you start another journey as a member of the House of Representatives for Abuja South federal constituency; and may you also support another person from any of the rural villages to continue in your step as the next chairman in 2022,” he said. Responding, the council chairman, Alhaji Ajiya, thanked the village chiefs for their support since the inception of his administration in 2016. “I will also want to call on village chiefs to always be vigilant by monitoring the kind of people that come into your domain. You can report to any security agents nearest to you of any suspicious person,” he said.
