The senator representing Borno South Mohammed Ali Ndume has disagreed with the position taken by the national leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) that Senate Leader Ahmad Lawan should be the next Senate President. Lawan was recommended as the next Senate President by the Adams Oshiomhole-led APC national leadership to President Muhammadu Buhari during a meeting with senators-elect for the 9th Assembly in Abuja on Monday night. However, Ndume, a former Senate Leader, said while briefing journalists in Abuja on Tuesday, that he believed the right thing was not done in taking that decision. He said the APC senators-elect were not consulted before the decision was taken, noting that majority of the APC senators were not happy with the decision. Ndume said the APC leadership’s decision did not reflect the true position of what President Buhari wants. Ndume noted that he had consulted both President Buhari and APC national leader Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu, who gave him the go ahead to contest for the Senate President’s position.
