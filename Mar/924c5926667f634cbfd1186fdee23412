Three persons lost their lives in separate auto crashes which occurred on the Abuja-Lokoja road last week. A witness said the first accident, which happened last Wednesday night, involved a Volkswagen Golf car with registration number XC 936 KWL and an unmarked trailer at Kwaita village. He said the Golf car rammed into a moving trailer from behind, in which the driver and one other person were  killed. He said the Golf car driver’s vision was blurred as a result of lack of rear light and thick smoke billowing from the trailer. Their corpses were later taken to Abaji for burial. “The trailer driver did not even stop after the Golf car hit him from behind and since the incident happened at night, nobody was able to go after him,” he said. He said the second accident, which also occurred the same day at Gada-Biyu village along the same road, involved a J5 Boxer bus with registration number LSR 844 XU and an Iveco truck with registration number MGR 280 XA. He said the driver of the bus died on the spot and one other person sustained injury after the bus overtook another vehicle and hit the truck from behind. When contacted, the Yangoji unit commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), ACC Joseph Samgbaza, confirmed the accidents, saying the police on patrol carried out the rescue in the first accident that claimed two lives. He attributed the accidents to speed limit violation and loss of control, saying one of the persons from the bus was taken to Kwali general hospital for treatment.  2 killed as car rams into moving truck 13 passengers injured in separate crashes at Sabon-Gari Auto crash: 3 injured at Abaji
