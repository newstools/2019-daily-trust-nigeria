The Senator-elect for Niger East Senatorial District, Alhaji Mohammed Sani Musa has described the news making the rounds that the ruling, All Progressives Congress, APC, might have made a u-turn to re-endorse Senator David Umaru as the party’s flag bearer for the zone, as a deliberate attempt to ignite crisis and set the state on an avoidable and unnecessary political turmoil. The Senator-elect, in a statement signed by a member of the advisory committee of Mohammed Sani Musa Campaign Council, Hon. Nma Kolo, said the publication titled, “Niger East: APC Makes U-turn, Backs David Umaru” was an exhibition of crass desperation and impunity to upturn the collective will of the peace loving people of Niger East Senatorial district. “There is no iota of truth in the publication. It was another ploy to upturn the will of the people which was earlier declared at the party’s primary. “It will be foolhardy for Senator David Umaru to get what he lost at the party’s primary through the pages of newspapers. Aside from the emergence of the Senator-elect as the flag bearer at the party through primary, the Federal High Court judgement also affirmed him as the bonafide APC candidate, a position that was further endorsed at a general election”. The statement noted that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had, in a letter dated 15th February, 2019 and signed by Mrs. Rose Oriaram-Anthony, the Secretary of the Commission, directed the Resident Electoral Commissioner to remove Senator David Umaru as the Senatorial candidate of All Progressives Congress for Niger East Senatorial District and replace him with Mohammed Sani Musa in pursuant to a court order.
