The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC,  on Saturday  arrested Alhaji Babalele Abdullahi, the son in-law of the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar. Babalele, who is also finance director of Atiku’s group of companies was arrested at his Maitama residence. It was gathered that the EFCC agents numbering about two dozen came in 2 regular vehicles, an 18-seater Toyota bus (registration Abuja CS 522 RSH) and a hilux van. They stormed Babalele’s Maitama residence at 8:30am but were prevented from gaining access into the house until his lawyers arrived “They came with a search warrant to search the house and office of Babalele and found nothing incriminating. They then proceeded to his office at Oakland Centre in Maitama and found nothing incriminating there. However, they took away some documents of landed property. Not done, the EFCC officials stormed his Wuse residence where they again found nothing incriminating after the search. Afterwards, Babalele was taken away to the EFCC office in Wuse to make a statement alongside Mr. Lawan Ayuba,” noted Paul Ibe, Media Adviser to Atiku. A top official of the EFCC declined comment on the arrest. The spokesperson of the commission also didn’t respond to numerous phone calls and  message sent to him on Saturday.
