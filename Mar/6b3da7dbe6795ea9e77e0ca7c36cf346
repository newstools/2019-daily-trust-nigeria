The Federal Government team and the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) yesterday resumed negotiation towards resolving issues raised by universities before the signing of the agreement by both parties. The chairman of 2009 FG/ASUU Re-Negotiation Team Dr Wale Babalakin told journalists after six hours meeting that they both parties were appropriately represented and had positive discussion. ASUU commenced an indefinite strike on November 5, 2018, over certain demands based on an agreement reached with the government in 2009, and after series of meeting to reach a negotiation, the strike was called off three months after, on 8th February 2019. The chairman who refused to disclose the issues discussed in the meetings said: “There are so many issues. ASUU submitted a timetable today and there are over 20 issues in that timetable so it is not a singular issue to be discussed and they will all be discussed.” “We actually hope that we are on a good path for finalizing the negotiation. We had a very positive discussion on topical issues and both sides made an extensive contribution for the benefit of the universities,” he said. “In the negotiation, you have to seek the consent of the other party before you make such disclosure. But at the stage of signing the agreement, we will be willing to tell you all the headline and all the important issue,” he added. He said: “On when it will happen, he said: “We start this morning at 10 am and there was a break for about 30 minutes. Both sides are determined to put an end to this. So, I reckon that it will happen within the fastest possible time.” While countering the possibility of ASUU going on another strike, he said, “I don’t believe it is ASUU’s objective to disrupt the educational system. But I think that we will find a solution. We must remain optimistic.” MOU: FG, ASUU resume negotiation FG and ASUU, please reach a deal Strike: FG to continue negotiation with ASUU today
