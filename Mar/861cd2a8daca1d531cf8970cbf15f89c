Following the declaration of Plateau South Senatorial election as inconclusive, the PDP candidate, Barrister Kefas Dandam Peter, has called on INEC to restore five polling units allegedly excluded ahead of tomorrow’s rerun. Kefas said the inclusion of the polling units would ensure justice and fairness, and that failure to do so would amount to disenfranchisement/denial of the people from exercising their constitutional right to vote. The PDP candidate who addressed newsmen in Jos, the state capital, said the reason why elections could not hold in the five polling units was either due to failure of card readers or violence which resulted to gun shots in different areas. “The polling units excluded during the last presidential and National Assembly elections are: Two wards of Langtang North, one in Bolyah Langtang South, one in Baltip in Mikang Local Government Area, and one in Kadarko district of Wase Local Government Area.
