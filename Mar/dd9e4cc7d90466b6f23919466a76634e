A former legislator, who represented Benue North East senatorial district at the red chamber of the National Assembly, Professor David Iornem, has called on residents of Benue State to re-elect Governor Samuel Ortom during the next Saturday’s election. Iornem, said in a statement made available to our correspondent in Makurdi, that his backing for the re-election of Ortom stemmed from the governor’s courage, innovation and selfless service, especially in the introduction of ranching in Benue state. “This singular policy, which is capable of protecting both farmers and cattle rearers is enough for Benue people to re-elect Governor Ortom to continue as governor so as to enable him implement the anti-open grazing law in the overall interest of Benue farmers and herdsmen,” he said. He added that Ortom has done well, stressing his confidence that the Benue people will bring him back to office. Iornem further hailed the governor for taking steps to curtail crises in the state because Benue state, as an agricultural state where unrestricted cattle movement and grazing co-existed in the past, could continue to cause conflict between farmers and cattle rearers if such moves were not made for peaceful harmonious habitation.
