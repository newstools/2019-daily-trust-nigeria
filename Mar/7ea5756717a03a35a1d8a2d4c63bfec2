The governorship candidate of Accord Party (AP) in Saturday’s election in Kwara State, Prince Ayorinde Adedoyin, has urged the electorate in the state to support him in his move to chat a new direction towards social and economic development. Adedoyin described the Oto ge (Enough is enough) campaign slogan of the APC, and Otunya (we are just starting) which is the slogan of the PDP in the state as “same contents in same bottles but with a different top.” Ayorinde said this yesterday while addressing journalists in Ilorin, where he also unveiled his economic blueprint. He listed plans to revive moribund industries and encourage the growth of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). He said the genuine change the people of the state were craving for would be a mirage if the same sets of people who had been defecting from PDP to APC and APC to PDP were returned to power. ‘‘Kwara, we must look at a different direction. If you really want true change, we should not be looking at APC, PDP. You cannot continue to re-cycle same set of people and expect new thing to happen. I don’t see anything new in APC and PDP because they are one and the same thing,” he said.
