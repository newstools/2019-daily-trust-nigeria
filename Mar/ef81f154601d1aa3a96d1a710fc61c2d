Governor Abiola Ajimobi of Oyo State has assured the new governor-elect, Mr Seyi Makinde, of his administration’s full support towards a successful change of baton and smooth take off  of the incoming administration. He gave the assurance, yesterday, during Makinde’s courtesy visit to him at the government house, Agodi, Ibadan. Ajimobi said “I congratulate you on the opportunity nature has given you to serve humanity. I commend your noble move which is different from the past when after someone loses an election, they will start making trouble and abusing each other. “We will be available to you should you need our advice. You should look at the areas we have done well and sustain it and in the areas we have not, please adjust it. We have always been brothers and I believe you deserve it. We should sustain this spirit we have started with,” he said. In his address, Makinde said the visit was to see the governor first-hand since the conclusion of the elections, adding that the incoming administration would be requiring the help of the incumbent in the interest of the state. Makinde said, “We will require your help. Electioneering is over and certain things that we might have said were just for the campaign talks, but now is the time to face reality. “You have done your own part. Our state is dear to all of us and we shall share your vision like I had said in one of our numerous interactions before the elections. We want to work together with you and make sure that the transition is as smooth as possible,” he said.
