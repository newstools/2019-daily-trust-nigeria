The Nigeria Agribusiness Register (NAR) is set to launch the maiden edition of its Agribusiness Networking event call AgNet. AgNet, a monthly event, is an outreach service of the Nigeria Agribusiness Register, designed to build a robust and convincing pipeline of agribusiness projects that matched with alternative capital providers such as venture capital funds through networking and deal-making events. In a statement yesterday by Mr. Fisayo Adesida of the organisation, the event shall focus on the five industries in the agro-inputs sector, namely, seeds, fertilizer, agrochemicals, animal feeds and mechanization. NAR stated that the agro-inputs sector has strong potentials but lacks sufficient funding to power its growth and development adding that the recent inclusion of fertilizer into list of 41 products restricted from official forex window by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) would open up opportunities for local fertilizer blenders to expand their operations, and thus many will require patient capital to grow and expand their businesses. The Founder and Director of the Nigeria Agribusiness Register and Chief Host of AgNet, Mr. Roland Oroh, was quoted in the statement that “Innovative solutions to address Nigeria’s food security challenges can come from the agro-inputs sector which is the foundation upon which many livestock and crop value chains are built…” Firm moves to link Nigerian agribusinesses with Dubai $100bn market Use agribusiness to boost economy, Dangote tells FG ‘Ban importation of agro-biz machines to Nigeria’
