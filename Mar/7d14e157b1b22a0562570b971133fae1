The Director General of AbdulRaman AbdulRazaq Campaign Organisation for Kwara North, Mohammad Kudu Mohammad, has said the All Progressives Congress (APC) gubernatorial candidate if given the mandate to lead the affairs of the state will bring in private sector experience to the state. Mohammad in a chat with Daily Trust said the coming of AbdulRazaq to the helm of affairs in Kwara State will bring about creation of wealth rather than depending on public sector funds to develop the state. The grassroot politician revealed his party’s plan to bring back the glory of Kwara if its gubernatorial candidate, AbdulRazaq wins the governorship election come Saturday, March 9, 2019. According to him, Kwarans rejected the Senate President, Bukola Saraki because “he has become self-centered and has reduced everything about Kwara politics to himself. The people realised this and decided to revolt.” “Many of us involved in the crusade of ‘O To Ge’ fame are largely from the private sector, so what we are bringing to the table is private sector initiatives and wealth creation to drive the system,” he said. He noted that his party expects rain and tsunami of votes for APC at the coming governorship and state assembly elections slated for Saturday.
