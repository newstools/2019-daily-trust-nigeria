An APC aspirant for Bauchi North Senatorial District, Usman Abubakar Tuggar, has asked a Federal High Court in Abuja to reinstate him as the candidate of the party. The suit was filed by his counsel, Olisa Agbakoba (SAN) against the senator-elect for the district, Adamu Muhammadu Bulkachuwa, the APC and INEC. In an originating summons filed before the court, Tuggar wanted the court to make an order that having been validly nominated as the party’s candidate in the primary held on October 3, 2018, his name ought to have been submitted to INEC. Bulkachuwa, who is the husband to the President of the Court of Appeal, Justice Zainab Bulkachuwa, flew the APC ticket in the just concluded presidential and National Assembly elections held on February 23. He was declared winner after polling 110,631 votes as against the 92,140 and 56, 379 votes for Mustafa Faruq of New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) and incumbent senator, Nazif Gamawa of the PDP respectively. Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu has fixed the matter for hearing on March 13.
