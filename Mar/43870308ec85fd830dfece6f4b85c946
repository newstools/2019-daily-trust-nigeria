Bayelsa based journalist, Mr Jones Abiri, has been arrested by men suspected to be operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS), Daily Trust on Sunday gathered. Abiri was arrested at Ayabowei Plaza in Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital on Saturday. Reports say the men stormed the venue with a white Hilux and black SUV while Abiri was discussing with his colleagues at the secretariat of the Bayelsa Publishers office. ”The armed men jumped out of the hilux van, threatening to shoot Abiri if he moved, only to be forced into the vehicle. They then zoomed off while the other jeep closely followed behind. The guns they carried were similar to those of the DSS”. “The men jumped out of the vehicles in a gestapo fashion while he was chatting with his friends, then shouted ‘you are under arrest’. While he was demanding to know his offence, he was forcefully pushed into a waiting vehicle at gunpoint. Currently, his whereabouts are unknown,” a witness said. In 2016, the DSS arrested Abiri, alleging that he was a militant. It also said Abiri, a known local newspaper publisher, was the leader of the Joint Revolutionary Council of the Joint Niger Delta Liberation Force, which has separatist inclinations and maintains ties with criminal gangs. He regained freedom in 2018, after intense campaigns from several local and international groups. Chairman of the Nigeria Union of Journalists in the state, Mr Samuel Numinengi, said the  union was making efforts to contact the DSS to know his whereabouts before issuing statement on the matter. The journalist’s younger brother, Lucky Abiri, confirmed the report, saying he received a phone call that armed security operatives had taken his brother away.
