Desperate Housewives star Felicity Huffman is among more than 40 people charged in a US college cheating scam, according to unsealed court records. The alleged scheme involved helping students cheat on entrance exams, as well as getting non-athletic students admitted on fake athletic scholarships. Elite schools Yale, Stanford, and Georgetown were among the destination universities. There was no suggestion that the schools were involved in wrongdoing. The defendants are largely wealthy and also include CEOs of major companies. “These parents are a catalogue of wealth and privilege,” said US Attorney Andrew Lelling about the case on Tuesday. According to the chargs, Ms Huffman made a “charitable contribution” of $15,000 (£11,500) to participate in the scheme on behalf of her eldest daughter. She allegedly arranged to use the scheme a second time, for her younger daughter, before deciding not to do so.
