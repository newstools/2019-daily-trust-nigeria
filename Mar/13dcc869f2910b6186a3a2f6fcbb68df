A terminally ill man in Connecticut has received his dying wish of speaking to US President Donald Trump in a surprise phone call. The call to Jay Barrett, who has cystic fibrosis and was recently moved to home hospice care, was arranged by his big sister – a local Democratic lawmaker. “You’re my kind of man, Jay,” Mr Trump said in the call. “You keep that fight going. We both fight,” he said. The president’s son, Eric, has also promised to send him a special gift. The call was first reported by the New Haven Register in Connecticut, which has been reporting on the bipartisan effort to connect him to the White House.
