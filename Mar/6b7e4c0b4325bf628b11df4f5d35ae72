The leadership of the association of Dakata Cottage Small-scale Industries in Kano State has called for intervention as Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) disconnects its members’ properties over disparity on payment of accumulated bills. Speaking to newsmen, chairman of the association, Alhaji Yusuf Mukhtar, said though they have written to the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), Kano Forum Office, KEDCO had begun massive disconnection of its members, an act which he said, has plunged the members into quandary. He said, “We have agreed on accumulated debt after reconciliation of the figures but KEDCO wants us to pay all outstanding debt at once. We cannot afford that and we have made it clear to them in writing and through all other means.”  KEDCO laments customers’ attitude towards payment of bills Don’t pay electricity bills to our staff, KEDCO admonishes consumers KEDCO@ 5: Achievements, challenges and future plans
