The Executive Director of HURIWA, Mr. Emmanuel Onwubiko made this call on Monday in a press briefing on the just concluded governorship and states assemblies’ elections in the country. He said the INEC chairman nearly pushed the country into a civil war with the conduct of the elections. He alleged widespread voter disenfranchisement, suppression, under age voting and violence and killings in the election. “There are human beings who are mourning because of the incompetence and deliberate sabotage by INEC. And who is in-charge? It is the chairman,” he said. HURIWA appealed for calm on rubbishing the image of the Nigerian Army as a result of the electoral offences and violence in Rivers, Bayelsa and other states, adding that the army have credible intelligence that political thugs were kitted and armed to impersonate solders. “The Army has already established a good and qualitative antecedent as a no-nonsense hierarchy when in the not too distant time it sanctioned 38 senior military officers who underwent investigative and military prosecutorial trial over alleged interference in the year 2015 general polls,” he said. “If this army hierarchy had done this it can always do the needful now that it has become imperative for it to separate the few bad eggs from the professional institution of the military if they are found guilty by the internal investigative mechanisms.” 2019 polls: HURIWA hails military, knocks INEC 2019  :INEC Chairman tasks staff on dedication to national duty INEC sets up c’ttees ahead of polls as PDP kicks
