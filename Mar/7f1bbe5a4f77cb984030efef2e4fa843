The United Progressives Party, UPP, has accused the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of omitting its party logo in the just concluded National Assembly election for Plateau North Senatorial seat. The party stated, in a press statement, that the action had disenfranchised thousands of its supporters as well as denied the party’s candidate, Sanusi Mohammed Inuwa from voting for himself. The statement, which was signed by the National Secretary of the party, Sadeeq Ibrahim Masalla, described the omission as an injustice which became apparent when “thousands of our supporters left their homes on February 23rd 2019 to exercise their franchise at the various polling units, but only to discover that our party logo was missing from the ballot paper for Plateau North Senatorial District.” “The omission of our party logo equally denied our candidate for the seat, Sanusi Mohammed Inuwa the opportunity to, at least, vote for himself despite the enormous financial resources he expended while campaigning for the seat,” it stated. While calling on its teeming supporters to remain calm, the party noted that it had written a petition to INEC in the State and was making arrangements to seek redress at the tribunal. When contacted, INEC head of Voter Education and Publicity, Osaretin Imahiyereobo, said though he was not aware of the omission, he advised the party to go to the tribunal. …YDP too over party logo Bauchi South Bye-election: UPP backs out, to support credible candidate from another party How PDP, others strategized for today’s polls
