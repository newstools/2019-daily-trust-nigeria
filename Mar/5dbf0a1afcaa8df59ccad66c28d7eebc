The Church of Christ in Nations (COCIN) has debunked news making the round that it has adopted a particular candidate and political party in Plateau State, stressing that the church will only support men of integrity and purpose who will deliver to the people. COCIN President Rev. Dachollom Datiri was seen in a two and half minutes’ video stressing that COCIN had not and will not adopt or sponsor any political party. “The reason is that our members are in all the political parties and what we are telling our members is that they should support that person whom they believe will deliver for them either in their constituency or in the whole state, so COCIN is not supporting any political party,” he said. The video, which was verified and authenticated by the COCIN Protocol Officer, Rev. Justin Ahmadu, showed Rev. Datiri warning that those spreading malicious information that the church had taken a partisan position on the upcoming gubernatorial elections will have to contend with God. Rev. Ahmadu had told Daily Trust that the video was taken on Tuesday at COCIN’s Karl Kumm University, where Governor Simon Bako Lalong did a foundation laying for the library complex initially promised by the immediate past administration of Jonah David Jang. Rev. Dachollom had in the video stressed that, “the way COCIN works is that every decision is taken either in a committee or a council, no single individual can take a unilateral decision; even the COCIN President cannot take a unilateral decision. “I want to state categorically clear that COCIN has never discussed anything to do with backing a political party; no decision like that was ever taken and no agenda like that has ever been tabled.”  We have not endorsed any candidate – COCIN Controversy over selection of Useni’s running mate deepens COCIN President accused of dabbling into politics
