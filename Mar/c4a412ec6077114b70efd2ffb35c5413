Outgoing governor and senator-elect for Borno Central, Kashim Shettima and the Chairman, Senate Committee on Local Content and senator-elect for Lagos West, Solomon Olamilekan Adeola, are among those who scored high votes in the recent National Assembly elections. Shettima who is completing his term as governor scored 342,898 votes, to defeat his challenger, Senator Abba Aji of the PDP who scored 75, 506 votes. Senator Ali Ndume who also won re-election to represent Borno South on the platform of APC trailed Shettima behind with 301,312, a feat that equally placed him among legislators that that scored high during the elections. On his part, Senator Adeola said he was one of the four senators-elect with the “highest votes” nationwide, contrary to a report that pegged him among senators with low votes at the recently concluded National Assembly elections. Sen. Adeola was reacting to a Daily Trust report that named him among those going into the 9th National Assembly with the lowest number of votes. Media adviser to the senator, Kayode Odunaro in a statement yesterday, said based on the results released by INEC, Senator Adeola scored 323,817 votes and  “therefore the 4th highest vote scoring senator-elect in Nigeria and certainly the highest in the three southern geo-political zones of Nigeria.” According to him, “With Lagos West being unarguably the largest senatorial district in Nigeria in terms of population of about 14m people, it would be preposterous for a senator-elect from such a district  to score only 23,189 votes to win his re-election as reflected in your front page. “It is grossly erroneous to write that Lagos West senator-elect is one of the 4 senators-elect with the lowest votes in the last National Assembly elections,” he added.
