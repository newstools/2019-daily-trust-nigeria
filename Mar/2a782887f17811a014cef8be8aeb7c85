A former Senate President, Senator David Mark, has expressed worry over the declaration of inconclusive elections in the country by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), saying that the habit was setting a bad precedence. Mark, in an interview with newsmen in Otukpo during the Saturday’s supplementary polls in the state, advised the INEC to rather avoid declaring elections inconclusive. “If we make it a habit, it is a very bad precedence. If declaration of inconclusive elections is allowed to stay, it will rather encourage some politicians not to sell themselves to the electorate but wait to disrupt elections so that it will be declared inconclusive. “I advise people to go into elections devoid of violence. If you win your election through the proper will of the electorate, you will earn their respect. Politicians should strive to ensure that they win elections through free, fair and credible elections,” he said. Mark added that such a development was not healthy for the society because the commission spend additional resources to conduct supplementary elections. He emphasised that inconclusive elections drains both politicians and the electorate, thereby making them (electorate) to be disillusioned. Mark further posited that the concept of inconclusive election was strange and unknown just as the constitution does not recognise it.
