Ten women’s rights activists have gone on trial in Saudi Arabia, raising questions about the kingdom’s human rights record. Those who appeared included Loujain al-Hathloul, a figure in the campaign to win Saudi women the right to drive. She was detained last May. A UK-based Saudi rights organisation, ALQST, said they were charged under the country’s cyber-crimes law. Demands for the women’s release have come from around the world.
