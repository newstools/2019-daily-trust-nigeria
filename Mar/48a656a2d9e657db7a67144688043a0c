A chieftain of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Plateau State, Dr. Yakubu Gambo has called on all patriotic Nigerians to eschew ethnic and religious division and join hands with the government to build the nation. Dr. Gambo, who spoke at a press conference in Jos, stated that, “since the election has been concluded and winners declared, we must now focus on building our country. All patriotic Nigerians must not allow any division to arise as a result of this election”. He commended Governor Simon Bako Lalong for his excellent leadership and thanked residents of the state for conducting themselves peacefully during the presidential elections. While charging the electorate to do same at the forthcoming Governorship and House of Assembly elections, the APC stalwart stated that, “from reports we got at the presidential elections, there was no case of violence or electoral malpractices in Plateau, the 2019 elections is an improvement on that of 2015 and we hope Nigeria would continue to improve her democratic principles.” “Peace has come to stay in Plateau, I call on citizens of our great state to continue to be their brother’s keeper, elections should not be seen as a ‘do or die’ affair, the governor has done a lot in uniting Plateau citizens as well as improving their lives and therefore needs to be supported,” he said. Dr. Gambo appealed to the people to come out en mass and ensure they vote for peace, unity and inclusive governance.  battle for 2015 presidency Buhari, Tinubu, Atiku at the crossroads We’re re-strategising for governorship election – Niger PDP 2019 Elections: APC, Army plotting to cause crisis in Rivers - PDP
