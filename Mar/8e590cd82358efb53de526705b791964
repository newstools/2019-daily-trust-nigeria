Usani while receiving the Indian High Commissioner to Nigeria, Mr Abhay Thakur, in Abuja on Tuesday said Nigeria looks forward to further high level engagements with India, especially in politics. “The Niger Delta is suffering a lot of things, communities in the region are being submerged under the sea due to serious coastal problems,” he added. The Minister stated that in every raining season, not less than 10 to 20 communities are being lost in some States in the Niger Delta region due to flooding. The Minister of State, Prof Claudius Daramola called on Indian Government to establish Indian Hospitals in Nigeria, saying such will check medical tourism. Mr Thakur said there was growth in his country’s collaboration with Nigeria, noting that his country was committed to further collaboration on investments, power, agriculture and youth empowerment in the Niger Delta region. He also said his country had a capacity building programme tagged, “Indian Technical and Economic Corporation (ITEC) Programme” under which his country had received several representatives from Niger Delta region of Nigeria,” adding that more youth in Nigeria, especially those from the Niger Delta region could tap from such programme.
