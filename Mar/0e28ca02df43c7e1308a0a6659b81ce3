The Candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for Ikpoba-Okha/Egor Federal Constituency, Ehiozuwa Agbonyinma, and that of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) for Ovia Federal Constituency have filed petitions at the Edo State Election Petitions Tribunal following the outcome of the February 23 Presidential and National Assembly election. They urged the tribunal to declare them winners of the election, having scored lawful majority votes. Agbonyinma was defeated by the candidate of the  PDP, Jude Ise-Idehen. Speaking with Journalists on Friday night after filing the petition, Agbonyinma said he won the election but some INEC officials  collaborated with some PDP leaders to perpetuate fraud by manipulating the electoral process. “I had valid ground to file this petition. Nobody can steal the mandate of the people that came out to vote for me and go free. Miracle happened during my time. For someone to call me thinking he is talking to PDP Chairman to redeem the balance after he has done everything fraudulently to derail the wheel of progress. I am happy that those who perpetrated this fraud have been arrested. They have confessed and the law will take its course. On her part, the candidate of PDP Barr. Omosede Igbinedion, said she won majority of lawful votes in the election but the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Hon Dennis Idahosa, was declared winner of the election. She said the results declared was not a true reflection of the people of Ovia Constituency as there was no reasons for her to lose the election. “There are several grounds which we intend to challenge the election. First thing is the candidate of the APC. There are so many things we know that tell us he was not worthy to contest the election.” Elections tribunal holds inaugural session in Lafia APC kicks as tribunal upholds Aduda, Jisalo’s elections Beyond the Tribunal Ruling in Taraba Governorship Election
