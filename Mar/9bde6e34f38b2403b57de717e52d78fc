The Federal High Court in Abuja has fixed April 2 for ruling on jurisdiction in the suit by the African Action Congress (AAC) challenging the collation of results for the March 9 governorship and state assembly elections in Rivers State. Justice Inyang Ekwo yesterday adjourned the case after the lawyers to the AAC and the PDP made their submissions. Counsel to the PDP, Emmanuel Ukala (SAN) challenged the jurisdiction of the court to hear the matter, arguing that every issue emanating from the governorship election should be directed to the election petitions tribunal. The court had on March 20 refused an ex parte application by the AAC and its candidate, Awara Biomkpomoba to stop the collation of the results in the state. Also, the Advanced Peoples Democratic Alliance (APDA) has brought a case against INEC and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) over moves to collate results for the governorship and state assembly election in Rivers State. The governorship candidate of APDA in the state, Warigbani Zebulun asked the court to cancel the results in 16 local governments where, according to him, collations of results had not been concluded before INEC announced the suspension of the election. Also, the candidate of Labour Party, Isaac Wonwu was challenging the decision of INEC to proceed with the collation of the March 9 results.
