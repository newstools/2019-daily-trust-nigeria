Wives of leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and some female political office holders in Sokoto state have led hundreds of women to the office of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Sokoto state, demanding immediate declaration of Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal as the winner of last Saturday’s Governorship election in the state. Among them were wives of former Governor Attahiru Dalhatu Bafarawa, Barrister Mukhtari Shagari and the state chairman of PDP, Alhaji Ibrahim Milgoma. Others were Commissioners of Basic and Secondary Education, Professor Aishat Madawaki, that of Ministry for Women Affairs, Kulu Sifawa and Science and Technology, Kulu Haruna, among others. The women were armed with leaves and placards some of which read “no inconclusive election” and “INEC, declare Tambuwal winner” among others. Our reporter observed some of the protesters hauled insults on INEC and vowed not to leave the place until their demand was met by the electoral body. It was at that time that the police had to use tear-gas to disperse them. Some of the protesters almost lynch our reporter whom they mistook  as the Resident Electoral Commissioner. The police have blocked the entrance of the office with armour tank just as more policemen were deployed to maintain peace and order in the area. 2015 Political Events in Retrospective Legal implications of Abubakar Audu’s death Page 56
