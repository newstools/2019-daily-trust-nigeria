Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Prof. Mahmood Yakubu said, yesterday, that the commission is set for the March 9 governorship elections in 29 states. He stated this at the opening of a meeting of the commission’s management with states Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs). The meeting was held after the declaration of President Muhammadu Buhari of the APC as winner of last Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly elections. According to Prof. Yakubu, the meeting, among others, was to review the processes and procedures deployed during the elections in a bid to make amends where necessary. He added that the meeting would also help in finalising arrangements for the forthcoming governorship and state houses of assembly elections. “Once we conduct the national election, we take stock and review, so that processes and procedures are strengthened, learning from previous elections, before we go into state elections,” Yakubu said. He said since the RECs were in Abuja with the State Collation Officers (SCO) for the presidential election, it was important for the commission to meet and review the experiences. “The next election is going to hold on Saturday March 9, and this is going to be the governorship in 29 states of the federation. As you are aware, in seven states, the governorship elections are staggered and conducted off season. We have since concluded these elections. “We have gone very far with the arrangements for the governorship and state assemblies,” Prof. Yakubu stated.
