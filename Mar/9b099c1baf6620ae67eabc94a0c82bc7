The African Centre for Leadership, Strategy and Development (Centre LSD) has tasked newly elected governors across the country and others in other arms of the government to be committed to the spirit and success of the Open Government Partnership (OGP). The Programme Coordinator, Centre LSD, Mr. Uchenna Arisukwu, made the call Friday in Abuja at a briefing on the Global Celebration of the OGP Week. According to him, the Centre was joining over 80 countries in the commemoration of the 2019 OGP Week, with this year’s theme being “Inclusiveness” and is geared towards empowering stakeholders at all levels to contribute their utmost towards the success of the partnership. He said OGP is a veritable platform for fighting corruption by opening the governance process as corruption is known to thrive in opacity and secrecy of operations.
