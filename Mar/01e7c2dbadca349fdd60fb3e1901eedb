The factional leadership of All Progressives Congress, APC, in Cross River State, led by Mr Godwin Eton john, has disagreed with yesterday’s suspension of its governorship candidate, Pastor Usani Usani alongside three others. Speaking through its secretary, Mr Francis Ekpenyong, the factional leadership condemned the decision to suspend Usani, saying the national working committee of APC does not have such power to suspend their governorship candidate for alleged anti-party activities without first hearing from them. Ekpenyong, who spoke exclusively to our reporter, said reports or petition against Usani ought to have emanated from them to empower the NWC to act but such never happened. “How can they sit in Abuja and know how the minister is conducting anti-party activities in Cross River State? We ought to report to the national via a petition if actually Minister Usani was engaging in anti-party activities. “We ought to have composed a panel to probe him. But such has never happened. It is Owan, Hilliard Eta, Ndoma-Egba etc that are engaged in anti-party affairs not Usani who effectively delivered his political ward and most parts of the state during the last presidential election whereas Ndoma-Egba and his friends did not. They were all rigged out. “The national is the one working illegally by aligning with the faction of Owan Enoh and co led by John Ochala. This is contempt of court and we cannot accept it”, Ekpenyong said. The factional leadership also berated the national chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole for aligning with the faction of Ndoma-Egba and John Owan-Enoh. 3-hour protest for Usani locks Calabar New faction emerges in Cross River APC Cross River APC asks Buhari to sack minister of Niger Delta Affairs
