A teacher in Tanzania has been sentenced to death for beating a pupil so badly that he died of his injuries. Judge Lameck Mlacha said Respicius Mtazangira, 51, had acted maliciously when he repeatedly hit the child with a blunt object last August. The teacher had accused Sperius Eradius,14, of stealing a female teacherâ€™s handbag. Corporal punishment is illegal in Tanzanian schools but remains common practice. The family of Eradius refused to bury his body until the culprit was arrested. Although death sentences can be handed down by law, Tanzania has not carried out an execution since 1994. Mtazangira has the right to appeal.
