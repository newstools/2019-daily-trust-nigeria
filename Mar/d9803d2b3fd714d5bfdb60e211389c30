Rev. Fr. Alexander Amalu, Assistant Parish Priest, St. Paul Catholic Parish Awkunanaw, Enugu, has called on Christians to always be good ambassadors of Jesus Christ. Amalu, who made the call on Wednesday in Enugu, during a mass to mark the Ash Wednesday, urged Christians not to relent in living the life of Christ after the Lenten season. “As Christians, you should be discreet when carrying out your Lenten services of fasting, prayers and alms giving. “You are not supposed to announce to the world when praying, fasting or giving alms. You do not need to shout or disturb the neighborhood while praying,’’ he said. He quoted Matthew Chapter 6 verse 5 from the Bible to buttress his claim on praying secretly to God without others knowing the content of the prayer. The priest said that Christians were not supposed to publicise to the world when giving alms and when fasting by looking gloomy. “Many people usually look very sad and dull when fasting and that is not good at all, you don’t have to let the whole world know you are fasting. “When giving alms to the needy, as part of our duty in this season, you should not announce what you have done because our heavenly Father who sees in secret will reward you in the open. “My advice to Christians is that any good character imbibed in this season of Lent should not stop after the Lent to enable you build pious life and be candidates of heaven,” he said.
