Some members of the House of Representatives have warned the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) against subverting the will of Nigerian electorates under the guise of inconclusive elections. Rising from a motion of urgent public importance on the need to stem the preponderance of inconclusive elections in Nigeria’s electoral system, the lawmakers warned that anything short of free re-run elections would throw the nation into chaos. The sponsor of the motion, Sunday Karimi (PDP, Kogi), had argued that declaring an election inconclusive at the stage of collation of votes is not only illegal but a calculated attempt by INEC to subvert the will of the people. He, therefore, called on the House to revisit the Electoral Act as a step towards a comprehensive reform of the electoral system. “I think there is need to revisit the Electoral Act in order to arrest this issue of inconclusive elections, which has become a mockery of our democracy. “There is no need for that because the Act supersedes every other directive by INEC,” Karimi argued. Ali Madaki (PDP, Kano), said the declaration of Kano governorship election inconclusive, in particular, was capable of throwing the state into chaos, “especially as the APC plans to use all resources to take Kano, against the will of the people. “I want to tell them that Kano is different. Kano is not Lagos and the people will not accept a rigged re-run election. We must resist that, and Nigeria will burn if they insist,” he warned.
