The Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, Zubairu Muazu, said at the weekend that the command will hold the leadership of the different transport unions in the state responsible for any breakdown of law and order in any part of the metropolis. Muazu, who gave this warning at a meeting he held with major stakeholders in the transport sector of the state, advised the leaders to talk to their boys on the need to conduct themselves in a peaceful manner before, during and after the forthcoming gubernatorial and state house of assembly elections. Those present at the meeting included leaders of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), the commercial motorcycle and tricycle riders unions and members of the Odu’a Peoples Congress (OPC). The CP asked leaders of the groups to caution their members not to lend themselves to unpatriotic elements who might want to use them to breach the public peace and destroy the peaceful coexistence among the various ethnic groups in the state. He added that the economic progress in the state derives largely from the peaceful atmosphere in the metropolis. He reiterated his earlier warning that the Command would deal decisively with troublemakers.
