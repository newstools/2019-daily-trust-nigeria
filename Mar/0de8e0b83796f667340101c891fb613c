Presidential candidate of the PDP Atiku Abubakar is fully committed to the victory of the party’s governorship candidate in Kano, Abba Kabiru Yusuf, his associate, Alhaji Mohammed Abdullahi Sugar, has said. Sugar stated this while reacting to reports that Atiku wasn’t committed to Abba’s candidature. Yusuf will slug it out with Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje in Saturday’s supplementary election to be conducted by INEC. “It is a lie concocted to portray Atiku in bad light; he has never involved himself in anti-party in his political career spanning decades,” Sugar said. “Atiku, our incoming president is totally in support of Abba’s candidature because Kano is his second home after Adamawa State. We are very happy that Kano people are politically-savvy persons, hence they voted against the APC government in the state,” he said in a phone interview. Sugar, a grassroots politician in Kano, said Abba will transform Kano as governor. “Under Abba, Kano will regain its glory as the commercial nerve of the North. Businesses will bounce back, and life will return to the state. He won’t be a stooge of Kwankwaso as being speculated,” he said.
