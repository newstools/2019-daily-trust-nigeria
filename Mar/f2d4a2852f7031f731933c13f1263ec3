There was general voter apathy as the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) conduct supplementary elections in five local government areas out of the 27 local government areas of the state. In all not fewer than 32, 816 voters are participating in the supplementary polls in 70 polling units of five state constituencies. They are are Ikeduru, Isu, Ngor Okpalla, Outta and Orlu state constituencies of the Imo State House of Assembly. Our correspondent who monitored the exercise in some polling centres observed poor voter turn-out in most of the polling booths. At PU 018 Amaudara Town hall in Uzoagba ward of Ikeduru with a voting population of 334 voters, one of the candidates was alleged to have used thugs to prevent people from casting their votes. At PU 012, Ndiokwu Village hall in Ngugo Ikembara in Ikeduru with a voting population of 214, only 20 people have voted at about 11 am. A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) agent. Emma Ibeawuchi, told newsmen that the exercise was peaceful while voting started at about 8.30. He said that voting materials were delivered on time while security was adequate. He attributed the low turn out to lack of awareness and the fact that people wanted to do one or two things before going to the voting point. Security was generally relaxed as there was no restriction of movement. Motorists going to Share from Owerri and passing through Ngor Okpalla were frisked by stern looking policemen.
