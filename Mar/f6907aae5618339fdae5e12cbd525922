North Korea’s election has resulted in the expected landslide win for its authoritarian leadership – but in a big first for the country, Kim Jong-un does not appear to have been on the ballot. If confirmed, it would be the first time a North Korean leader has not run for its rubberstamp parliament. The vote did see his sister, Kim Yo-jong, elected to the body, however. The leader’s younger sibling has been gradually moving into a more influential role. North Korea’s parliamentary election is used by Pyongyang to legitimise its rule, but is condemned as a meaningless exercise. Each voting slip has only one state-approved candidate on it.
