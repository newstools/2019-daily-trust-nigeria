The African Centre for Leadership, Strategy and Development (Centre LSD), has said that the effective utilization of the $188 million raised by the Federal Government and an additional N30 billion recently released by the government would boost the nation’s economy, apart from the success of the Ogoniland clean-up exercise. The Acting Executive Director of the Centre LSD, Mr. Monday Osasah, said this yesterday in Abuja at the first quarter 2019 media roundtable on the emergency measures and clean-up of Ogoni land, tagged, ‘Achieving a Healthy and Sustainable Environment in the Niger Delta-Still on the Emergency Measures and other Sundry Issues in Ogoni Land and Environs’. He said while the clean-up will benefit the Niger Delta region and the people, the nation’s economy will also massively benefit from the success of the exercise as many people would be empowered and the fund revolved in the nation’s economy. According to him, succour came at the beginning of this year with the contracting and subsequent hand over of polluted sites to different companies, signifying the commencement of the clean-up exercise in Ogoni land. ‘Ogoniland oil spill cleanup will boost Nigeria’s economy’ Centre decries delay in Ogoni clean-up As Ogoni cleanup begins
