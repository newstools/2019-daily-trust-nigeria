The approval was given at the meeting which was held at Federal Palace Hotel in Lagos, yesterday. The boards of Access and Diamond banks have hitherto approved the general terms of the merger which will create a leading Tier 1 Nigerian bank and the largest bank in Africa by number of customers. After the voting, a total of 1,529 shareholders with a share value of 97.98 percent voted to ratify the merger. Ten shareholders representing 2.1 percent voted against and 30 shareholders abstained. Under the terms of the scheme, Diamond Bank customers will receive consideration comprising cash of N1 per share and 3 shares in an enlarged Access Bank for every 7 Diamond Bank shares held  as at yesterday. Speaking at the meeting, Group Managing Director of Access Bank, Herbert Wigwe said: “Based on our retained earnings and the Tier 2 support capital we have, there will be no need to raise another capital to complete the transaction. “We are working with the best people to ensure that value is not eroded,” he said. Wigwe said the overall dilution impact of the merger on Access Bank is 19 per cent, while noting that the merger will bring on board a significant value from Diamond Bank, an institution with over N1 trillion in low funds deposits.
