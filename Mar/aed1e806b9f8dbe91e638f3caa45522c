Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State has declared that he never regarded the defeated governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic party, Prof. Kolapo Olusola-Eleka as an enemy. Fayemi, however, said Eleka and the PDP were free to challenge his victory at the Supreme Court, in spite of his readiness to entertain contributions from the main opposition party. The governor spoke in Ado Ekiti on Friday at a programme tagged “Meet Your Governor”. Fayemi stated that he had never perceived Eleka as an arch enemy in spite of the petition he filed against his victory in the July 14, 2018 poll. “I have never seen Prof Olusola Eleka as an enemy, but I have been seeing him as a co- contestant, so we won’t shy from approaching him to seek his advice on any issue we feel he could be of help for smooth running of our government. “But this should not be misinterpreted to mean that we are trying to prevent him from seeking justice up to the supreme court; he is free to challenge us. “The Appeal Court, on Thursday delivered its judgment, declaring that PDP has no evidence of rigging against us, so we are not afraid of being challenged.” On the just concluded presidential, National and state assembly elections, which APC won wholesomely in the state, Fayemi denied the allegation that federal might and money were deployed to muzzle the opposition in the polls.
