The chairman of Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), Abdullahi Adamu Candido, has urged residents to vote for the candidate of their choice with civility. He said residents as citizens should exercise their franchise by voting during the FCT area council election so that Nigerians can have leaders that pilot their affairs on Saturday, adding that by so doing they should conduct themselves in a peaceful manner. “As they come out the people must conduct themselves because this is a civilised country where we would not like people to get killed for nothing. When we go out to vote, it should be with civility,” he said. Candido, who spoke on Saturday in Jikwoyi, however, said people of AMAC have not seen his best yet, and assured them of improvement in all that he has been doing should he be re-elected. “I have always assured the people of AMAC that the more I get the opportunity, I work better. We learn daily and I have learnt so many rudiments of life. The moment I get another opportunity, I promise the people of AMAC that they will see more improvement in all that I have been doing. “I have always ensured that people get the best. Even as people are campaigning, I have been working. The AMAC people have not seen anything yet,” he said.
