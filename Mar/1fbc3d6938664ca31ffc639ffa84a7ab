Uber said, yesterday, that it has extended its Partner Injury Protection cover for driver-partners to include a daily payment benefit. Since 2017, Uber driver-partners and riders across Nigeria have been protected on the road, however, with this new update, driver-partners in the country now have more peace of mind when using Uber. General Manager for West Africa Lola Kassim explained that the extended partnership with AXA Mansard Insurance will play a huge role in achieving the company’s goal of “reliable, affordable, and safe transportation options for all driver-partners and riders across Nigeria.” “This update forms part of Uber’s global commitment across the Middle East and Africa (MEA) region and is a unique, first of its kind solution for driver-partners and riders using technology apps across Nigeria.” Driver-partners are covered from the moment they accept a trip, while driving to pick up a rider, and until the trip ends, and riders will be covered from the moment a trip starts, until the trip ends.
