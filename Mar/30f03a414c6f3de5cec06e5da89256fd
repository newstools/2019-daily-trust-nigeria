Anambra State Governor Willie Obiano has challenged his political appointees to brace up for better performance or risk being sacked. Obiano gave the warning  in a message to  mark the first anniversary of his administration’s second term in office. The governor said he had so far made the state better than he met it in 2014. “Forbes Magazine USA recently recommended the State government’s Community Choose your Project Initiative as a model for the development of Africa. I assure  you that I will remain focused and  I will not hesitate to change anybody who is underperforming in my cabinet,”he added. He said the support from the State House Assembly was responsible for the achievements recorded in all sectors of the state economy  in the past five years.
