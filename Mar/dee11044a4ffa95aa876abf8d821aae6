The Federal Government has given a total grant of N20 million to four national academies for publication of professional journals to boost Research and Development (R&D). The Minister of Science and Technology, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, who gave the money yesterday in Abuja, said the grant would go a long way in boosting Nigeria’s economic development. Dr Onu said the N5 million each to the four academies: Nigerian Academy of Sciences (NAS), Nigerian Academy of Engineering (NAE), Nigerian Academy of Letters (NAL) and Nigerian Academy of Social Science (NASS), would also help the country’s educational development. The minister said the grant would also assist the academies to produce journals that would fast track information dissemination of research findings toward national development. He added: “If you are solving a scientific problem, you need to also understand the environment. You also need to understand the relationship with human behaviours.” Onu further said the support was to demonstrate the readiness of the ministry toward supporting the academies’ future activities. He said the grant was also to ensure that the national academies no longer depended on foreign funding for their activities. “We think that Nigeria has come of age to make sizeable contribution to your funding,” the minister stated.
