Mainstream Energy Solutions Limited (MESL) says it can now generate 922 megawatts (MW) at Kainji, Jebba hydropower plants in Niger State but that 72 billion energy invoices remain unpaid in the Nigerian Electricity Market. The Managing Director of MESL, Engr. Lamu Audu, who received the Director General of the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), Mr Alex Okoh and BPE’s Director of Power, Yunana Malo, during the plants’ tour, said the huge debt was an operational challenge. He said, “There are accumulated unpaid invoices of N72bn receivables as at March 11, 2019 in the market; it does not include capacity charge and if there is to be an interest on these debts.” He said MESL is the concessionaire for the 1,338MW capacity plants but that only 582MW was available as at takeover in November 2013. They were rehabilitated and are now the highest energy producers. He further said the continuous ramp down on power generation requests from the Independent System Operator (ISO) due to energy load rejection affects the plants’ turbines and was discouraging more investments. “We are trying to encourage the board to do this expansion to target the international market through the West African Power Pool (WAPP). “It is a serious issue that needs to be addressed, if not, we cannot go anywhere,” he noted urging BPE to find solutions to them.
