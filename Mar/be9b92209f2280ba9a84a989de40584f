British Airways is set to deliver significant changes to the onboard product and service in its First cabin as part of its £6.5bn investment for customers. The new look and feel, set to take to the skies from March 31, will include new bedding, amenities and menus that would not look out of place in a revered five-star British hotel, the airline said in a statement. The airline’s First customers will be offered super-soft, sophisticated new male and female loungewear designed exclusively by luxury British fashion brand Temperley London. The loungewear will be coupled with bespoke British Airways amenity bags, featuring Temperley’s “Star” design. The bags will be filled with products from No 1 British Skincare brand, ELEMIS, including products from the highly sought after Ultra Smart Pro-Collagen range. The amenity kit contains the essentials to cleanse, revive and hydrate. The airline’s chefs have also designed new delicious a la carte menus that focus on fresh seasonal ingredients of British provenance. British Airways’ Regional Commercial Manager West Africa, Kola Olayinka, said: “As part of our £6.5bn investment for customers, we’re changing parts of the travel experience in our First cabin. Our teams of designers, chefs and customer service experts have carefully thought through the details we know matter most to our customers. “In this, our centenary year, we’ve sought out some of the best British designers and manufacturers to work with to ensure travelling in First with British Airways is an unforgettable experience.” British Airways increases African flights Qatar Airways wins two gold awards British Airways sacks cabin crew over racist comments on Nigerians
