The Resident Electoral Commissioner, Mike Igini has said elections will hold in Ibesikpo Asutan local government area despite the fire incidence that engulfed the Independent National Electoral Commission’s (INEC) Office there. Igini who reacted to the fire incidence said the fire would not stop the commission from carrying out its duties on Saturday as most of the sensitive materials for the conduct of the elections are still intact. He acknowledged that some Card Readers, generating sets, computers and other office equipment were burnt but noted during an assessment of the incident in Ibesikpo Asutan local government area that the elections will hold. “There is no going back on the March 9 election. Election will hold as scheduled, no matter the plot,” he said.
