The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Anambra state on Monday told the state governor, Willie Obiano, that he can no longer deceive the people of the state again. In a statement signed by the PDP’s spokesman in the state, Nnamdi Nwangwu, said Obiano has completed his circles of  deceptions in the state “and this is time for reality.” The party said it was worrisome that the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) controlled state government would at this election time suspend taxes that people had been paying for a long time. The governor, Nwangwu said, came up with game of politics, when he announced the suspension of taxes already being paid by the people few days to the Anambra State House of Assembly election. According to PDP, the governor had been on merriment since his acclaimed 21/21 election victory only to be rolling out tractors and bulldozers at abandoned sites just for the election. PDP said it is funny and laughable that the Anambra State governor still believes he can deceive the people and get away with it any longer. The PDP spokesperson urged the people of the state to use the March 9 Assembly election to prove Obiano wrong by voting for the PDP candidates in the coming election. It added that a PDP government would provide effective governance in the state, if elected. “The House of Assembly needs quality individuals who can come up with laws that will push Anambra state to her place of pride in the comity of states and at the same time carry out their oversight functions accordingly. “A situation where the assembly has been reduced to a rubber stamp institution that takes instructions from the governor is neither good for the state nor for democracy,” it added.
