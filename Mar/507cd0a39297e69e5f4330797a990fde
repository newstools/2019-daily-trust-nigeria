The All Progressives Congress (APC), in Yobe state, has won 23 out of 24 House of Assembly seats in last Saturday’s governorship and state house of assembly elections. The party loses the lone seat to the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) after many years of unsuccessful battle between the two major political parties in the town. The winner is the biological son of the former Yobe state chairman of the PDP that defected to APC fortnight ago at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The Returning Officer for the election, Dr. Abacha Mailemi of Federal University of Gashua, declared that “Lawan Sani (a.k.a. Mr Last) of the People’s Democratic Party scored 19,793 to defeat the incumbent member, Hon. Shuaibu Danladi Usman of APC that scored 11,395. Meanwhile, the ruling APC in the state had won all other elective positions such as governorship, 3 senatorial, 6 House of Representatives and 23 State House of Assembly seats. Lawan Sani won the lone seat of the Nguru central state constituency.
