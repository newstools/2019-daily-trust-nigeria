Three more presidential candidates in the February 23 election have asked the Presidential Elections Petitions Tribunal at the Court of Appeal in Abuja to quash the declaration of President Muhammadu Buhari as the winner of the election. The candidates: Ambrose Owuru of the Hope Democratic Party (HDP); Geff Chizee Ojinka of the Coalition for Change (C4C); and Aminchi Habu of the Peoples Democratic Movement (PDM) in their separate petitions alleged widespread irregularities and substantial non-compliance with the Electoral Act in the February 23 presidential election. Owuru, whose petition is marked: CA/PEPC/001/2019, scored 1, 663 votes; Ojinka, whose petition is marked: CA/PEPC/003/2019, scored 2,391 votes; and Habu had his petition marked CA/PEPC/004/2019. Among the reliefs sought by Habu include: “A declaration that the second respondent being the candidate of the third respondent (APC) was not lawfully or validly returned as the winners of the said election by virtue of the unlawful exclusion of the petitioners. “An order nullifying the return and declaration of the second respondent (Buhari) as the winner of the election held on February 23, 2019, for the office of the President on grounds of wrongful exclusion of the petitioners from the Presidential election held on February 23, 2019.
