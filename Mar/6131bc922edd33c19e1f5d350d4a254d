Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State says it would have been strange if he had lost the just concluded governorship election in the state. He said the fact that he had given appointments to over 8,000 personal assistants, advisers and others gave him confidence that he will win the election. Ayade said he had prepared much and believed strongly that he deserved the reelection because he had performed beyond expectations. Ayade spoke to journalists when he visited sites of some of his ongoing projects, saying he felt challenged by his victory. “A governor that does not owe salaries, that lifted embargo on employment, expanded government by appointing 8,000 people into office; a governor that has industrialised the state, why wouldn’t such a governor be re-elected?” he asked. “I won in all polling units. It has never happened in the history of Cross River,” he further stated. Governor Ayade urged Cross Riverians to unite and join him in fixing the state.
