…says Sanwo-Olu’s lead shaky An opinion poll has predicted outright victory for Governors Abdullahi Ganduje, Nyesom Wike and Aminu Tambuwal of Kano, Rivers and Sokoto states respectively ahead of Saturday’s governorship election. The poll also said 53 per cent undecided voters made Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s lead shaky in the Lagos governorship race. ANAP Foundation, a non-profit organization, which commissioned the poll, said it had been carrying out election polls since 2011, to provide researched information and promote good governance. “For the incoming governorship elections in Kano, Rivers, Sokoto and Lagos states, state-wide opinion polls commissioned by ANAP Foundation confirmed significant lead for Governors Ganduje, Wike and Tambuwal. “In Lagos, Sanwo-Olu leads, but his lead is not unassailable because undecided voters are huge at 53%,” the poll stated. In Kano State, the poll projects a two-horse race between Governor Ganduje of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Kabir Yusuf of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). It, however, revealed that “Ganduje’s lead is significant and might be unassailable” even with a 30 per cent undecided voters. Ganduje’s strength includes women empowerment (21%), trustworthiness (17%), continuity (17%) youth empowerment (11%) and performance (9%). However, Yusuf’s backers point at his personality (25%), change of government (20%), preferred choice (19%), unbiased decision (9%) and intelligence (5%). In Rivers, “victory appears to be assured for Governor Wike as he had a significant lead even before the withdrawal of other candidates.” Of the 80 per cent voters polled, Wike’s PDP had a 48 per cent lead, leaving Tonye Cole and Magnus Abe, both of the APC, with 8 per cent and 3 per cent respectively. In Sokoto State, the poll confirmed a two-horse race between Governor Tambuwal of the PDP and Ahmed Aliyu of the APC. However, “Tambuwal remains in a comfortable lead” after a sample of 90 per cent decided and 35 per cent undecided voters. Whereas Tambuwal is approved for his competence (26%), continuity (17%), likeability (8%), workers’ welfare (7%) and leadership skills (7%); Aliyu is rated for positive change (54%), feeling for the poor (17%), Buhari’s influence (10%), and party affiliation (9%). In Lagos, it is a straight fight between Sanwo-Olu of the APC and Jimi Agbaje of the PDP. Among potential voters, Sanwo-Olu is tipped for continuity (50%), popularity (9%), charisma (8%) ideas (7%) and leadership skills (7%). Agbaje backers are however banking on change (70%), better candidate (21%), likeness (6%), and competence (2%). With a (plus/minus 2.20 per cent) error margin and a confidence level of 95 per cent, the pollsters said they were sure of the poll’s validity and reliability.
