Ahead of Saturday’s supplementary elections in Benue state, the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate, Barrister Emmanuel Jime, has called on security agencies in the state to carefully watch Governor Samuel Ortom, ex-Governor Gabriel Suswam and two others. Jime through his media aide, Deputy Director, Communications of Jime/Ode Campaign Organisation (JOCO) 2019, Kula Tersoo, also requested that ex-Interior Minister, Comrade Abba Moro and a House of Representatives member-elect, Herman Hembe should be held responsible if there is breakdown of law and order during the Saturday’s rerun election in the state. “These people have track records of mischief and association with militia, especially, Suswam and Ortom,” he alleged. But in a swift reaction, Ortom’s Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, wondered why Jime was yet to respond to the accusation allegedly trailing his driver caught by EFCC with huge sums of money during the election. “The case is in court. What about Senator George Akume threatening terror all over the places? If anyone is to raise alarm, it shouldn’t be Jime who is known for violence; such person with temperament is not good for governor of Benue state. But Ortom is known as a peace-loving man,” Akase posited. The APC governorship candidate however urged security agencies to ensure restriction of movement on the day of the rerun and ensure those who have no business in areas where the rerun is to take place stay away from those areas. Jime added that, “already we have written petitions to the relevant security agencies on this uncovered diabolic plans. We call on them to as a matter of urgency, invite the characters mentioned above for questioning.” Jime accuses PDP chieftains of rigging guber polls Jime, Ortom trade words over Benue inconclusive poll Ex-Ambassadors seek cancellation of Benue supplementary election
