Abductors of famous Kano Qur’anic reciter, Sheikh Ahmad Sulaiman, have contacted his family, Daily Trust on Sunday gathered. Confirming the development, Malam Muhammad Nasir Dan-Kurna, an errand boy of the cleric, said the abductors called the family several times. Dan-Kurna said, “Sheikh’s kidnappers called us through his mobile phone. In fact, they allowed him to speak with members of his family from morning to evening of (Friday) but they seized his phone in the night. “They called about five times before we connected them with a Gwandu-based renowned Islamic scholar. “What happened is that after we spoke with them and I informed his colleagues, Sheikh Nasiru Gwandu directed me to give the abductors his number whenever they want to commence negotiations and that was what I did.” Asked whether the abductors have demanded any ransom Dan-Kurna said he could not say because after the kidnappers collected Gwandu’s phone number, they only called once to inform him that they had contacted Sheikh Gwandu. “I can only confirm that negotiation is in progress, but I have no idea how much they are demanding.  I pray we get Sheikh Sulaiman alive,” he said. He thanked those who have shown concern and appealed to the Muslim ummah to intensify prayers for immediate release of the scholar. ‘Whereabouts of Wamakko’s abducted brother still unknown’ Gunmen kidnap SUBEB’s secretary in Kano Gunmen kidnap SUBEB''s secretary in Kano
