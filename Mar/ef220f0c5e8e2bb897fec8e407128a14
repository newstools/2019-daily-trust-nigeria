The Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, has asked the Court of Appeal in Abuja to reverse the judgement that nullified his election. The Osun State Elections Petitions Tribunal in Abuja had on Friday last week in a majority decision ruled that Senator Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) scored most valid votes in the September 22, 2018 governorship election. The tribunal nullified the September 27, 2018 rerun election, which took place after the election was declared inconclusive with the PDP candidate leading Oyetola of the All Progressives Congress (APC). In a 39-ground notice of appeal filed on March 26, by his team of lawyers led by Wole Olanipekun (SAN), Oyetola faulted the majority judgement by Justices Peter Obiora and Anyinla Gbolagunte on the grounds that it was perverse, replete with contradictions and not supported by petitionersâ€™ evidence. The governor faulted the majority judgement of the tribunal, except where the tribunal held that it lacked jurisdiction to set aside INEC Guidelines; that the allegation of over voting was not proved; that the petitioners did not prove voided votes and other parts of the judgement where the tribunal agreed with their arguments. Among other grounds of contention, Oyetola argued that by cancelling elections in 17 poling units, the lower tribunal acted without jurisdiction and overlooked Section 139(1) of the Electoral Act.
