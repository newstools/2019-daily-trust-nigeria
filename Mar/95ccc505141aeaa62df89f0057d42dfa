The International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA), Abuja branch, has stressed for the role of women in the society towards building a better society regardless of gender. The chairperson of the branch, Ngozi Ikenga, made this call on Friday during a march organised by the branch to celebrate the year’s International Women’s Day. She said the march was aimed at calling for people to join FIDA Abuja to support gender-responsive innovations for society’s collective transformative gains. “Women’s talents, skills, opinion and experiences are vital towards influencing the design and implementation of the innovations that shape our future societies,” she said. Ikenga added that there was need for everyone to oppose systematic and entrenched barriers against women and girls, and support gender equality for a truly progressive and balanced society. She also called for a level playing ground for women to be well represented as their male counterparts in every sphere of life. She added that there appears to be a drop in women representation in governance which, she noted, was asymmetric to the vision 50-50 by 2050.
