Troops of the Operation Lafiya Dole in Borno State killed five insurgents when members of the Boko Haram group attacked a military formation near Ngwom village, that is situated about 15 kilometers away from the state capital. Confirming the attack, the Army spokesman, Col. Sagir Musa, said in a statement that, “troops of 122-Task-Force-Battalion deployed in the Forward Operation Base at Ngwom Community in Borno State effectively destroyed some Boko Haram terrorists when they (troops) had a fierce encounter with terrorists fighting in four gun trucks at about 10:30pm on Wednesday. “The bandits had in the recent past attempted to attack the same troops’ location but physically receded because of stiff resistance and aggressive pursuit from the indefatigable and patriotic troops on a noble military expedition,” Col. Musa said. He added, “in the encounter, tremendous success was achieved, – troops captured the following; two gun-trucks mounted with anti-aircraft-gun, two Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) tubes and five AK-47 rifles. “Additionally, five Boko Haram members were forcefully sent to “permanent sleep”. Several others evidently escaped with gunshot wounds. “Similarly, on the same day, at about 11:00pm, troops deployed at Gulak responded to a distress call from Kubu village in Shani Local Government Area of Borno State, on the nefarious activities of terrorists – criminals operating in the village. “On getting close to the area, the bandits engaged the troops with sporadic firing. In the process, the following incidences were recorded: “A BHT was deleted and one AK-47 rifle was recovered. No loss of life or casualty on the part of the Nigerian Army”.
