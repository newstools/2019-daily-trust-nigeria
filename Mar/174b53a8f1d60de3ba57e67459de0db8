A group under the aegis of Coalition of 28 political parties in Sokoto state have rejected the outcome of 2019 supplementary governorship election held last Saturday in the state. “The elections were hugely marred by myriads of flaws which had rendered the results of the polls, null, void and unacceptable,” it stated. Addressing journalists in Sokoto on Tuesday, the secretary of the coalition, Musa Aliyu of NEPP, said: “The elections were characterised by massive vote buying, intimidation, non-use of card reader machine as well as duplication of voting in polling units were the polls were earlier conducted.” He added: “The polls were characterised by acts of violence which contravened the nation’s electoral laws and constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.” Aliyu said they also observed that certain polling units were left out as elections were not conducted. “The Coalition which comprises of patriotic and seasoned democrats has therefore deemed it necessary to unravel these infractions on Electoral Act 2010 as amended, as well as INEC Electoral Guidelines.” He expressed the coalition’s support for the action of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to seek legal redress for the “injustices meted to it, its gubernatorial candidate and his running mate.” “In the same vein, we are hereby humbly drawing the attention of all lovers and protectors of democracy, both at home and abroad as well as all International Observers groups and democracy defenders to this obnoxious development which has rendered the outcome of the polls as ineffective and non-plausible.” The coalition however appealed to their supporters and peace-loving people of the state to remain calm and law-abiding while they patiently await the outcome of the litigations on the polls.
