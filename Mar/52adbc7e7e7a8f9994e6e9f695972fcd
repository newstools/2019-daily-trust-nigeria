The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has expressed sadness over alleged cases of harassment, maiming and killing of its ad hoc staff recorded in the recent general elections. The commission said politicians must stop actions that lead to killing of innocent citizens serving their fatherland due to their desperation to capture power. The National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education of the commission, Festus Okoye, stated this yesterday in Awka during the presentation of certificates to the 30 newly elected members of the state House of Assembly. According to him, the sad incidences of maiming, killing and harassment of INEC staff were the handiwork of desperate politicians who wanted to win elections at all cost. He urged politicians to leave INEC staff alone and concentrate on their political campaign efforts. “The commission is worried at the rate at which ad hoc staff of the commission are harassed, maimed and killed in the performance of their duties. “We are fast approaching a point where parents and guardians will not be willing to allow their sons and daughters engaged in the national youth service to participate in the electoral process. “Non-participation of our best and brightest, fresh from tertiary institutions will leave the commission with the option of harvesting its ad hoc staff from sources whose loyalty to the national cause is questionable,” Okoye said.
