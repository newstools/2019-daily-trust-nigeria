Two men have been arrested over the murder of Marielle Franco, an outspoken black councillor in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro. The arrests come almost a year after Ms Franco and her driver were shot dead, an incident which caused mass protests. Ms Franco had been highly critical of the deployment of federal security forces to Rio’s poor neighbourhoods. Suspects were former members of the military police force. Ms Franco was returning from an event encouraging black women’s empowerment on 14 March 2018 when a car drew alongside hers and nine shots rang out.
