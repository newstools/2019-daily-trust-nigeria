One of the APC governorship aspirants in Zamfara state, Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa, has hailed the judgement of the court of appeal which set aside the ruling of the Zamfara State High Court on the party’s primaries tussle. The Court of Appeal, Sokoto Division, had on Monday set aside the ruling by Justice Bello Shinkafi of the Zamfara State High Court on the APC Governorship, National and State Assembly primaries. Reacting to the Appeal Court’s decision on Monday, Marafa said the judgement has shown that truth would always prevail over falsehood, saying he and his other colleagues in the race were vindicated. He said: “I have always believed that the Zamfara State High Court ruling was nothing but a black market judgement that can never stand legal scrutiny. “The Appeal Court judgement has rekindled the fact that the judiciary is the last hope of the common man. We are all living witnesses to the fact that the APC in Zamfara was unable to conduct primaries and couldn’t reach consensus due to the attitude of Yari, but the Zamfara State High Court judge ruled against the truth. “The Appeal Court has today done justice by throwing the judgement of the Zamfara High Court to the trash bin, where it rightly belongs,” he said. While commending the million of his supporters for their support, cooperation and patience, Marafa urged them to discountenance the press release from the Zamfara State Government House, claiming that today’s judgement has no effect on their election. “The statement by the Zamfara Government House on the Appeal Court judgement is the last kick of dying pigs, not even horses. You can’t build on nothing, APC didn’t conduct primaries, they don’t therefore have candidates in the just concluded elections,” he said.
