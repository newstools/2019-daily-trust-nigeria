Reducing inequalities and removing barriers that exclude women from influencing development in all sectors advances food security, the World Food Programme (WFP) has said. In the IWD massage yesterday, the WFP said this year’s UN theme for International Women’s Day – think equal, build smart, innovate for change – resonates with WFP’s gender-transformative approach: working to give everyone lives of dignity, choice and opportunities. “For example, our integrated programmes using cash transfers contribute to reducing gender-based violence, strengthening women’s decision-making and increasing women’s leadership.” “Putting women and girls front and centre in policy decisions and in programmes to tackle hunger and poverty is vital for reaching our goal of a Zero Hunger world by 2030.” said WFP Executive Director David Beasley.
