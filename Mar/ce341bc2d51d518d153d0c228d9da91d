Kano State police commissioner, Mohammed Wakil is the hero of this year’s general elections, Alhaji Mohammed Abdullahi Sugar, has said. Sugar, a political associate of the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, said the police commissioner should be singled out for commendation by the acting Inspector General of Police, Mohammad Adamu. “Since he was deployed to the state, the police commissioner has changed policing in the state. Despite the size of the state, he was able to secure the state. His conduct, especially during the governorship and state assembly deserve commendation,” he said, in a phone interview. He urged other police officers in the country to emulate Wakil, saying their duty was not to protect the government of the day but to work in the interest of the country. He said the outcome of the governorship election has shown that Atiku won the presidential election but the outcome was rigged by the All Progressives Congress (APC), to favour president Muhammadu Buhari. “Atiku was voted in Kano and many other states of the country. He won the election but the outcome was rigged for Buhari. But we are hopeful, his stolen mandate would be retrieved through the court,” he said.
