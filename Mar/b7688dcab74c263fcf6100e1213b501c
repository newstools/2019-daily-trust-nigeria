A cruise ship that got into trouble off the Norwegian coast has arrived at the port of Molde in Norway after the dramatic rescue of hundreds of people. The Viking Sky lost power on Saturday and sent out a distress signal after it began drifting towards land. Rescuers airlifted almost 500 of the 1,373 people on board from the ship in bad weather. Footage from inside the vessel shows it heaving violently in rough seas, with furniture sliding across the floor. The Viking Skyâ€™s engines were later restarted and evacuations were halted as it then made its way to Molde, accompanied by several tug boats.
