The House of Representatives member-elect for AMAC/Bwari federal constituency, Micah Jiba, has assured his constituents of good representation in the National Assembly. The former chairman of Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), while addressing journalists, said he was not going to the House of Representatives for his personal interest but to protect the interest of the people of AMAC and Bwari area council. “Now that I am elected as a member of the House of Representatives, I am not going there for my interest, rather, I am going there in the interest of the good people of AMAC and Bwari, to defend their cause and to promote bills that will better the living standard of the people. “I will do my best to sponsor some bills like the Integration of Original Inhabitants of Abuja, Satellite Town Development, and Original Inhabitants Development Commission,” he said. He said he would also operate an open-door policy and be transparent in the distribution of constituency projects in ensuring that no part of his constituency was left out. “As I will always say that power belongs to God and He gives whom He chooses, I will like to call on my fellow contestants to come and let us work together for the development of AMAC/Bwari federal constituency,” he also urged.
