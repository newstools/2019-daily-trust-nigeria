From Abdullateef Aliyu, Lagos and Chris Agabi, Abuja  The Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi, has tasked contractors handling the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge railway project to complete the civil works by April 2019 so as not to be disrupted by the rains. Though the rains have come in Lagos, Ogun and Oyo states, the belt within which the rail track traverses, the rains are expected to be in full swing around April. Amaechi said if civil works were completed before the rainy season, the laying of tracks could progress unhindered. Speaking during a routine inspection of the project alongside officials of the ministry and the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), Amaechi observed that there has been slow tempo of work largely because of the just concluded elections as the contractor in line with their company’s policy demobilized workers on the site. The 156-kilometer project is being handled by China Civil Engineering and Construction Company (CCECC). “We are pushing now that they must complete civil works before the rains and they have promised that by the time we come on 28th of March, they would have gone far with the civil works,” the minister said. It would be recalled that the track laying had been done from Iju Lagos up to Kilometer 82 in Abeokuta which prompted the test-run conducted by the Federal Government. Amaechi said, “The slowdown of work was due to the elections because in line with their company’s policy, most of them traveled back to their country  but they are coming back and the speed will increase.” I pray next Transport Minister has my kind of passion – Amaechi Lagos-Ibadan rail: Drama as Amaechi demands list of indigenous engineers on site Lagos- Ibadan railway: Tracks laying begins April 2018
