The Presidential Elections Tribunal at the Court of Appeal in Abuja has approved an application by Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar to serve President Muhammadu Buhari and others the processes for the election petitions filed at the tribunal. A three-member panel of justices presided by Justice Abdul Aboki yesterday held that it is in the interest of justice to allow Atiku and PDP to serve Buhari through substituted means. The panel ruled that the court processes for the petition challenging President Buhari’s election at the February 23 presidential election are to be served on the president through the national headquarters of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at No 40 Blantyre Street off Ademola Adetokunbo Street, Wuse 2, Abuja. Ruling on the ex parte argued by lead counsel to Atiku and PDP, Chris Uche (SAN), Justice Aboki ordered that the documents could be served on any senior member of the APC. While moving the motion, Uche had informed the tribunal that it was practically impossible to reach Buhari to serve him personally because of the retinue of his security details. In a 17- paragraph affidavit with seven grounds, Uche pleaded with the panel to order that Buhari be served outside the Presidential Villa. Respondents in the motion before the tribunal are INEC, Buhari, and APC. Atiku and the PDP had on March 18 filed a petition challenging the declaration of Buhari as the winner of the February 23 presidential election.
