An attack, suspected to be a reprisal, has been launched on Nandu, a village in Sanga Local Government Area of Kaduna State. The attack, carried out Friday night, claimed nine lives with eleven houses completely burnt down. Confirming the incident, the Chairman of Sanga Local Government Council, Mr Charles Danladi said normalcy had since returned to the affected village. Mr Danladi said authorities of the local government had intensified efforts at dousing down tension to prevent the possibility of counter reprisals. He said youths of the area had been summoned and counseled against embarking on any acts capable of escalating the ugly situation. In an interview, a resident of the affected village, who sought anonymity, said the attack was suspected to have been launched by herders as a reprisal after they were initially attacked before the last election, where eleven cows and twenty eight sheep were killed.
