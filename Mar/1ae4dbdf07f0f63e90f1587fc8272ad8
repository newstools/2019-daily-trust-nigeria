Two persons have been confirmed killed on Tuesday evening as a result of electrocution at Sparkling Junction, Dadin Kowa, in Jos South local government area of Plateau State. The victims, Daily Trust gathered, were labourers, working at the newly constructed branch of the United Bank for Africa (UBA), situated at Sparkling Junction in Dadin Kowa, when the incident occurred. A witness said three youths had been electrocuted but one had survived and is being treated at a hospital. He stated that: “It happened when the iron ladder they were using came in contact with a high tension wire. The victims were peeling off the stickers on the tiles of the wall of the bank when the iron ladder came in contact with a high tension wire, and they all fell to the ground.” He said security agents had visited the newly constructed bank premises where the two corpses were evacuated and the third victim conveyed to the hospital. However, Plateau State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Tyopev Terna did not respond to calls and a text message to his phone but a brother to one of the deceased, Ibrahim Ahmed, told journalists that his brother, a labourer had died in the incident. Ahmed said his brother’s body and another had been moved to Bingham University Teaching hospital before the family retrieved the remains for burial while the third person was responding to treatment at the hospital.
