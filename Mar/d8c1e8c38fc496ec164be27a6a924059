Some Nigerian women, on Friday, held a rally in Abuja to appeal to the presidential candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar to congratulate his opponent and winner of the election, Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (PDP). The women, under the aegis of Two Million Woman Rally for Democracy in Nigeria, Peace and Stability, started their march at the Unity Fountain down to Hilton Area before proceeding to the Force headquarters, Eagles Square and back to Unity Fountain. Speaking during the rally, the convener, Mary Onuche, called on Atiku to save Nigeria from anarchy and embrace “his brother”. Onuche also called on President Buhari not to disappoint Nigerians who have overwhelmingly voted him for another term. She said fortunately for Nigeria, the country’s democracy, though still young, had continued to evolve in ways that reassured the citizens that things could only get better. “One such leap is the development in 2015 when the then President Goodluck Jonathan called to congratulate the then winner of the presidential election, incumbent President Buhari, even before the votes’ tally was completed. That singular act of patriotism is today hailed as the benchmark of the level of statesmanship befitting of candidates in our elections. May God bless President Goodluck Jonathan, the hero of our modern democracy,” she added. Women storm Abuja, beg Atiku to concede defeat Atiku begs Buhari, INEC to ensure every vote count Atiku, Secondus, Fayose, Saraki, others insist Buhari must be defeated
