The Director General of APC Presidential Campaign Council, Rotimi Amaechi, said yesterday that President Muhammadu Buhari will run an all-inclusive government. Amaechi, who addressed journalists at the headquarters of the campaign council in Abuja yesterday, said President Buhari was ready to hit the ground running because of his realization that Nigerians had suffered more than enough. “I think what we should be saying is we are grateful to Nigerians and PDP. Lets not fight but encourage INEC so that elections will be free and fair. I think we should leave the past. We now have another four years to prove them wrong. “Not only will he (Buhari) run an all-inclusive government, he is guided by the fact that Nigerians have suffered enough. The president will ensure we run a government that satisfies Nigerians,” he said. He said since the presidential election was over, it was time to implement policies and grow the economy, pointing out that the economy could not grow without tackling security challenges. Amaechi said the re-election of President Buhari by 15.5 million Nigerians who were satisfied with what the APC-led federal government was doing was a referendum.
