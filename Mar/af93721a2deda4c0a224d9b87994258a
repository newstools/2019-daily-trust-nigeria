Bauchi state government has debunked allegations by the spokesperson to the PDP Governor-elect, Dr Ladan Salihu, that the outgoing APC administration is making last minutes deals to incur liabilities. In a statement on Thursday by the Special Assistant to Governor Mohammed Abdullahi Abubakar on Media and Strategy, Ali M. Ali, it described the allegations as spurious. “Our attention has been drawn to the usual fantastic claims of the incoming PDP government that the outgoing government of Gov. M.A. Abubakar plans to implement the new minimum wage of N30,000 and also recruit 8,000 teachers in the coming days. “These are absolute falsehoods being paddled by the government in waiting. It is manifestly clear that the hawking of half truths and peddling of outright lies are the hallmarks of the opposition PDP. This latest misrepresentation is a clear testimony. “The issue of minimum wage is on the exclusive Legislative list. In simple language, it is a federal government matter. As such, it is preposterous to suggest that the MA Abubakar administration plans to implement what is legally impossible,” the statement read partly. It could be recalled that the Governor-elect’s spokesperson had at a Press Conference earlier on Thursday accused the APC administration in the state of making last minute huge financial transactions.
