Suspected armed bandits Sunday killed at least 30 people when they laid siege to Kware community in Shinkafi Local Government Area of Zamfara State, Daily Trust has gathered. The local government had witnessed series of deadly attacks by suspected armed bandits and cattle rustlers.  Kware is located 18 kilometre east of Shinkafi town. The Sunday’s attack on Kware community was the second in a week, with more than 60 people reportedly killed in both incidents. Last Thursday, more than 30 people, largely local vigilantes, were reportedly killed by the armed bandits near the community. Residents told Daily Trust yesterday that the armed bandits, two days after killing more than 30,  returned to the community, firing at them, torching residential houses, shops and motorbikes. “They circled the community and began to set ablaze houses. They shot dead whoever came out and attempted to escape the carnage. “The remains of about 30 people had already been buried. We are serious trouble as a people, “ a resident, Musa Dan Doki, said.
