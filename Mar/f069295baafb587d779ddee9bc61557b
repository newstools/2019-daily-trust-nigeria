A father and son from Syria have been buried in New Zealand, the first funerals for the 50 victims of last week’s mosque shootings. Khaled Mustafa, 44, and Hamza, 16, came as refugees to New Zealand last year. Six burials took place on Wednesday. Police hope they will soon be able to release the bodies of all those killed in the two Christchurch mosques. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a self-described white supremacist, has been charged with murder. Islamic tradition calls for bodies to be buried as soon as possible, but the funerals have been delayed by the scale of the identification process. Meanwhile, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has called for a global fight to root out racist right-wing ideology following last week’s deadly attack on two mosques in Christchurch.
