The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) is to sanction violators of approved land use, an official disclosed on Friday. Such violators would face prosecution and demolition of illegal structures for their failure to get approval for changes. Mr Muktar Galadima, the Director, FCT Department of Development Control, gave the warning during an inspection of a property which it sealed in Gwagwalada. The property, a beverage factory still under construction, was approved for building of a warehouse, but was changed into a water producing company. Galadima insisted that unlawful change of land use by developers without recourse to the appropriate authority remained a serious contravention of building rules and guidelines in the FCT. Mr James Babagbale, who spoke for the contractor handling the property, confirmed the change of land use, but said that approval was given by the Federal Ministry of Environment. The inspection team also visited other places including Trinity Garden, Wuse and Junkyard, near Musa Yar’Adua Centre, and warned against abuse of guidelines. Galadima also warned other developers and residents to always contact the Development Control department before commencing any form of development in the nation’s capital.
