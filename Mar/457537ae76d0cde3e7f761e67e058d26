A Bauchi based group of lawyers under the aegis of Body of Bauchi Lawyers of Conscience (BOBALAC) has supported the decision taken by the Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC) to re-collate and ‎announce the governorship election results of Tafawa Balewa local government area. The group in a statement in Bauchi on Sunday signed by its convener, Shipi Rabo Esq and secretary, Musa Abdullahi Esq stated that they supported the INEC decision after reviewing developments arising from the declaration of the March 9th, 2019 governorship and state House of Assembly elections as inconclusive. “In fact‎, we consider INEC’s decision as the best and most proper thing to do under  the circumstances because, as we have noted, the initial stand of the electoral body especially the declaration of the votes of Tafawa Balewa L.G.A as cancelled was wrong as same could not have been founded on applicable laws,” the group stated. The group‎ noted that, although it recognised the rights of stakeholders like the ruling APC to express their views, the issues must be put in their proper place. “And whatever is the decision of the people of Bauchi ‎State, it has to be respected by all and sundry. By the special grace of Almighty God, the people’s will will prevail,”it added.
