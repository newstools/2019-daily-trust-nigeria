The Israeli military says it has begun carrying out strikes on Hamas militant targets in the Gaza Strip, hours after a rocket hit a house north of Tel Aviv. No details were given about the strikes, but explosions were heard in western and southern Gaza. The Israeli military earlier accused Hamas, which controls Gaza, of firing the rocket that hit Mishmeret on Monday morning and injured seven people. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced it as “wanton aggression”. “Israel will not tolerate this, I will not tolerate this,” he told reporters during a ceremony at the White House at which Israel captured from Syria during the 1967 Middle East war.
