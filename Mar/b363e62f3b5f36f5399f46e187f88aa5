The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)’s women wing in Niger State, on Sunday, stormed the State headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in protest of the governorship poll outcome. The result of the last local government area, Kontagora was being expected when the women stormed the Collation centre in protest of what they referred to as a “scam”. The women, who were chanting “Ole”, “Thief”, “declare the right result,” urged the PDP Chairman in Niger State, Tanko Beji not to sign the results sheet as the outcome did not reflect the mandate of the people. The leader of the protesters, Talatu Sauka said “we are here because we don’t agree with the result. It is not possible for the election to be held in 25 local government areas and the PDP cannot win any. “This is nothing but a fraud, a scam and we shall raise our voices against the charade.” When it was pointed out that party agents signed the result sheets at the various local government areas, Talatu said, “some of the party agents were bought over”, while others were chased from polling units.
