Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State has said he will include the two defeated APC gubernatorial candidates, Usani Usani and Senator John Owan-Enoh as well as that of SDP, Barrister Eyo Ekpo, in his cabinet. Ayade, who won a second term on the platform of the PDP, disclosed this, yesterday, in a statement issued at the end of a state security meeting in Calabar. The governor promised to run an inclusive government that will foster unity in the state. Ayade said he was extending an olive branch to all those who contested the governorship election with him to join hands and move the state forward. “I want every single Cross Riverian, particularly those who ran election against me to recognise the fact that I am ready to provide a platform for us to come together. “Some of them have great ideas, some of them are intellectually brilliant and I have respect for them all,” Ayade said. He said getting them to play pivotal roles in his government would help fast-track the realization of his prosperity agenda for the state.
