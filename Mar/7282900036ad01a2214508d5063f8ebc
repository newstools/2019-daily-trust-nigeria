Election went smooth in local governments outside Kano metropolis despite clashes experienced in Dala local government area of the state. Reports from Bichi, Tofa, Rimin-Gado, Karaye, Minjibir, Tudunwada and Doguwa indicated that election is being conducted peacefully. Daily Trust gathered that the turn out was impressive as voters came out in numbers to exercise their civic rights. However, voters have expressed mixed reactions concerning the conduct of the poll so far as some alleged that they were denied access to the polling units, while others expressed satisfaction with the way the election was conducted. Hajiya Lubna Hassan told Daily Trust at Suntulma Primary school polling unit that she was happy with the way the election was conducted. She said: “The election was peaceful. No body deny me to vote contrary to what some people are saying. I came to the polling unit around 9am and the security at the main entrance of the school checked my PVC and allowed me to enter. “The method adopted by the security operatives was excellent. They allow only people with PVCs to enter the school and cast their votes. Anybody who does not have PVC is not allowed to gain access into the polling units.” Abdullahi Muhammad, a PDP agent at Layin Baba Dala-Dala polling unit, Gama ward alleged that PDP agents were maltreated at various polling units in the area. Another voter, Abubakar Ibrahim said he could not vote because of fear of the unknown, saying “I was completely scared to approach the polling unit because I don’t know what will happen. “Some people refused to go to the polling unit for fear of attack by thugs that took over the place.” Journalists escape lynching in Kano Rerun election Fierce contest for PDP as it tests APC dominance in Kano ‘We’re excited casting our votes for the first time’
