The APC Presidential Campaign Council (APCC) has asked the Inspector-General of Police and the Director-General of the Department of State Services to investigate the alleged hacking of and/or illegal tampering with the INEC server by the PDP. A petition addressed to the two personalities by the Director, Strategic Communications, APCC (Official Spokesperson), Festus Keyamo, said the leadership of the PDP must be invited, interrogated and investigated while those identified as perpetrators must be arrested and prosecuted. The protest letter titled ‘Petition to Invite, Interrogate and Investigate the PDP Leadership over Its Admittance of Illegal Access to INEC’s Server” read in part, “The proper elections were held on February 23, 2019 and President Muhammadu Buhari declared the winner. Despite the approval of the elections as credible by nearly all local and international observers (except some few known PDP acolytes masquerading as local observers), the PDP cried foul and made a shocking claim: it claimed that from purported results it obtained from INEC’s server, it has so-called proof that its candidate won the election by about 1.6million votes! “Shockingly and coincidentally, this margin was about the same margin by which it also purportedly “won” by the fake results released just hours after the postponement of the February 16, 2019 Presidential/National Assembly Elections. “As if this expensive joke was not enough, the PDP and its presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, have gone ahead to file an election petition against the clear victory of President Muhammadu Buhari and have repeated the same outlandish claim of having access to INEC’s server which shows that they have some purported results at their disposal giving ‘victory’ to Alhaji Atiku Abubakar,” the APC said.
