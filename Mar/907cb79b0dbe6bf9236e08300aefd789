Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State said, yesterday, that the PDP candidate, Engr. Abba Kabir Yusuf and his supporters will receive the shock of their lives in the rerun governorship election. Ganduje said he was unperturbed by the wishful thinking and slapdash deportment of the PDP candidate considering what happened in the inconclusive election widely characterized by alleged vote buying and voter intimidation by the opposition party. The chairman, Publicity of the 2019 Election, Malam Muhammad Garba, in a statement he signed, said the APC and its candidate remained upbeat and sure of victory as Kano remained an APC state. He said while Ganduje remained committed to the conduct of free and fair election, all loopholes that gave them chance of rigging, vote buying and intimidation of voters had been blocked. “APC as a party has also re-strategized and is very confident of victory because the local government areas where the rerun will take place remain the APC stronghold and the electorate in these areas have made up their mind to vote massively for the governor they trust,’’ he said.
