An FCT High Court in Apo has fixed today for judgment in a suit seeking the disqualification of Adamawa State Governor, Mohammed Jibrilla Bindow, from the forthcoming governorship election, over alleged certificate forgery. Justice Olukayode Adeniyi fixed March 1 for the judgment after counsels to all parties in the suit argued and adopted their respective briefs for and against the suit. However, when the matter came up on Friday, Justice Adeniyi apologized to the parties that the judgment was not ready. He said he had earlier sent the court registrar to communicate the development to the parties. He thereafter fixed judgment for today. A group, Incorporated Trustees of Kingdom Human Rights Foundation International, had alleged that Bindow supplied false information to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in his INEC Form CF 001 This, he allegedly did by purporting to have sat for the West African Examination Council (WAEC), in June, 1983, and possess General Certificate of Education (GCE) issued by the examination body. The plaintiff accused the governor of falsely declaring his educational qualification and date of birth for the purpose of nomination/election into the office of Governor of Adamawa State for the 2019 general elections.
