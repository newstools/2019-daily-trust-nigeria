US Congresswoman Ilhan Omar has condemned a poster linking her to the 9/11 attacks displayed at a Republican stall in the West Virginia legislature. She said the “anti-Muslim display likening me to a terrorist” encouraged threats of violence against her. West Virginia Republicans said they did not support hate speech and had told the exhibitor to remove the poster, which showed her and the burning twin towers in New York. Ms Omar was elected last November, one of the first two Muslim women to have been elected to the US Congress.
