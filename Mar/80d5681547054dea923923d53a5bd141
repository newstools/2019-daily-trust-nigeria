The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Benue State, Barrister Emmanuel Jime, has accused three chieftains of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of rigging the inconclusive governorship and state assembly elections in the state. Jime made the allegation in a press statement signed by the deputy director of his campaign organisation, Kula Tersoo, against the trio of ex-governor Gabriel Suswam, former Interior minister, Abba Moro and incumbent Governor Samuel Ortom. But in a quick response, Ortom’s Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, said Jime resorted to raising unfounded allegations of rigging against the PDP having known that he had lost the Benue governorship election. The APC governorship candidate, in the statement, alleged that PDP stalwarts perpetrated “unprecedented electoral heist never seen in the history of the state”. He said they did not only rig the elections through all forms of manipulations but also connived with INEC to defraud the APC at the polls. “Presiding officers were bribed and coerced to submission. Those who did it for fear for their lives came back and gave us these facts. They also assured us that if there is need, they will not hesitate to testify in court,” the statement said. Ortom, however, in his response to the accusation, said Jime realized that he had lost even before the supplementary poll with 81,554 votes margin. He also alleged that APC tried to manipulate the March 9 polls in the state but failed because the people stood firmly behind him. “Jime should tender proof of his rigging claims against the PDP.  Lastly, Jime should explain to Benue people his pact with enemies of the state to cause political crisis when Governor Ortom is declared winner of the election,” said Ortom.
