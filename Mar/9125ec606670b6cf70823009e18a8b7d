Convener of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Restoration Coalition in Imo State, Dr. Theodore Ekechi, has commended members of the coalition and the people of the state for the failed bid of Governor Rochas Okorocha to install his son-in-law, Uche Nwosu, as his successor. The coalition comprised mainly serving and former political appointees of the outgoing governor. Ekechi, who spoke to our correspondent in Owerri, said that but for the resilience and determination of the people of the state, Imo would have “ended up having an emperor.” The coalition accused the governor of allowing his wife’s “inordinate ambition of imposing their son-in-law on Imo people, coupled with his rudderless leadership of perfidy and not paying attention to processes and proceedings expectedly cost the APC not just the governorship seat but also national assembly as well as state assembly positions.” Ekechi said that Okorocha, in setting out on his failed succession plan, failed to listen to voice of reason, but instead was “basking on the syndrome of his self-exaggerated opinion of his popularity.” While regretting that the ruling APC did not only lose the governorship, but also the presidency, National and State assembly seats in the state, Ekechi said that the coalition was not surprised at the outcome of the election because they had warned that the consequences of the governor’s succession plan would be catastrophic for the party.
