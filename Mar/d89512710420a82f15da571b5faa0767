The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has donated to the Nigerian Army Institute of Technology and Environmental Studies Makurdi various ICT devices. Handing over the devices at NCC headquarters Abuja, yesterday, the NCC head Information Technology Department, Engr. Abraham Oshadami, said the gesture will go a long way to complement the efforts of the Nigerian Army towards achieving its mandate and to further enhance the security of the country. He said it all started in October last year when the institute wrote to the commission requesting for partnership, sponsorship and soliciting for the intervention of the commission to provide ICT facilities for the use of the institute. Engr. Oshadami said: “The commission no doubt expects that this gesture will go a long way to complement the efforts of the Nigerian Army towards achieving its mandate and to further enhance the security of the country. “It is our hope that the donation will make a difference to the staff and students of your institute not only by improving their access to information and communications technology tools but to enhance their skills in computing as well as understanding and developing appreciation of ICT for improved efficiency in teaching and learning in various subjects. In her remarks, the director of the institute, Nwanfor Chidima, said the institute lacked some of the equipment therefore “it will actually go a long way because we have students who are computer scientists. It would help them in their research work. We look forward to your (NCC) support whenever we call on you,” she said.
