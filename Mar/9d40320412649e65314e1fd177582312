As part of efforts to save cost and improve services to residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), the FCT Administration is set to collaborate with the office of the Surveyor General of the Federation through the use of state-of-the-art equipment of the surveyor general’s office. FCT Minister Malam Muhammad Musa Bello disclosed this when the Surveyor General of the Federation, Surveyor Ebisintei Awudu and his technical team paid him a courtesy visit in his office. He also said the move is saving the FCTA scarce resources which could be invested in other sectors. According to the minister, “leveraging on your facilities saves us having to do multiple investments in facilities that are already existing and which we can easily utilized.” While commending the good work of Nigeria’s surveyors in the progressive development of the FCT since its inception, Malam Bello expressed the willingness of the FCT Administration to partner with the office of the Surveyor General of the Federation for the achievement of the mandates of both organisations. Earlier, Surveyor Awudu had called for more collaboration between his office and the FCTA, especially in the areas of conducting surveys and mapping. The surveyor General also emphasized the need for the FCTA to leverage on the highly sensitive equipment of his office which, according to him, could help in identifying earth tremor locations even before they occur and their growth direction. He also charged government organisations to handle data generated from surveys with utmost care, adding that such information should be solely in the custody of the Director of Survey in the organization. Awudu stressed that survey data in the wrong hands could be a threat to any organization or state. ...urged to computerise operations Staffs receive training on NAGIS computerised land admn page 37
