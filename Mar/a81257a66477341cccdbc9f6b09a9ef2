The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the  Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) have hailed the verdict of the Osun State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal, which held that the PDP candidate, Senator Ademola Adeleke, won the 2018 election held in the state. The PDP said the judgement is a signal that it would reclaim its “stolen mandate” in the 2019 general elections. The PDP in a statement Friday  by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan said the judgment was a clear indication that those who set out to destroy the nation’s democracy would never triumph. The party said no matter how evil and injustice appear to thrive, the truth must always prevail at the end of the day. “The spontaneous jubilation that greeted this judgment is therefore a direct indication that it is in consonant with the wishes and aspiration of Nigerians across the board.” Similarly, the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP), in a statement Friday by its Spokesman and National Chairman of the Action Peoples Party (APP), Chief Ikenga Ugochinyere said Adeleke’s victory is a huge boost to the opposition and Atiku Abubakar’s quest to reclaiming his “stolen” presidential mandate. “The CUPP sees the judgement of the tribunal as victory for democracy and affirmation of the supremacy of the sanctity of the ballot.” “We are hopeful that the Appeal Court and Supreme Court judges will be bold enough to send the 2019 mandate thieves out office when the time comes,” Ugochinyere said.
