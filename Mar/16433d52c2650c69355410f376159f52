The ad-hoc staff of Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Saturday protest the non-payment of their camping allowance, at Oliha Primary School in Benin, Edo state. Our reporter who visited the Oliha Primary School observed that the INEC ad-hoc staff  were seen arguing with INEC officials there over money issue. The protesting ad-hoc staff mobbed journalists who attempted to take pictures and video of the incident and forced them to delete all photos and videos of the scene. Speaking with our reporter, one of them who craved anonymity, said they slept on bare floors of the classrooms, adding that despite severe mosquitoes bites yet they refused to pay them their allowances. “The materials came early, but they have not paid our camping allowance. That is why we have refused to go to our respective polling centres. “Our money was supposed to be N4,000, but they are giving us N3,000. We slept on bare floors over the night and they are still doing this to us,” he lamented. Responding, the state Resident Electoral Commissioner, Mr. Emmanuel Alex-Hart, expressed shock over the incident, saying he was not aware of it. “I will call the Electoral Officer in charge of Egor to find out why,” he said.
