The Federal Government has sealed the pumps of the fuel stations of Forte Oil and Dan Oil in Abuja for overbilling unsuspecting customers. To ensure that all commercial transactions involving the use of weights and measures are accurate, fair and legal, the Weights and Measures Department of the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment yesterday in Abuja sealed no less than three dispensing pumps at two Forte Oil fuel stations in Maitama. The Acting Director of the Department, who led the inspection, Engineer Mohammed Sada Sidi, said the Department discovered in multiple pumps at Forte Oil that for every 40 litres of fuel customers bought, they were overbilled by one litre. The Department said this under-dispensing translated to cheating customers of N194, 000 for every 33,000 truck of fuel sold. A similar discovery was also made by the Department when it swooped on Dan Oil located at the Airport road in Abuja. At the Dan Oil station, it was discovered that for every 20 litres that customers buy, they are cheated by over half a litre. Engineer Sidi announced the immediate revocation of the Weight and Measures licenses issued to both Forte Oil and Dan Oil pending when both companies comply with measuring standards set by the enforcement team. He said the measure was essential to ensure that customers are not overcharged for less quantity of goods and sellers are not underpaid for more quantity of goods.
