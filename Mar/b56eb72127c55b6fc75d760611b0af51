President Muhammadu Buhari has launched the Micro Pension Plan (MPP) for self – employed and Nigerians working in the informal sector of the country. The president launched the programme at the State House, Abuja with the registration of a Keke NAPEP operator, Sagir Shawa. The president personally registered the tricycle rider himself. Buhari said the programme was conceived for Nigerians in the informal sector of the country. He appealed to trade associations, unions and NGOs in the informal sector to join hands with the government in enlightening their members on the importance of the scheme. ” This initiative will capture those that are not fully captured in the existing pension scheme. In the past three years, we have provided loans to farmers and others in the the informal sector. The micro pension plan is the next step,” he said.
