The Bauchi state chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC) has welcomed the decision of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to obey the court order which halted continuous collation of the governorship poll results of Tafawa Balewa local government area of the state on Tuesday. The APC state chairman, Alhaji Uba Ahmed Nana, disclosed this on Tuesday while addressing journalists. He said as a law-abiding party and citizens, they are bound to obey court orders. “That is sequel to the suit filed against the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) challenging its decision to resume and conclude collation of the Governorship Election Results of Tafawa Balewa LGA which is contrary to the Electoral Act 2010 as amended,” he said. The party therefore urged its supporters to remain calm and be law-abiding as the court makes pronouncement on the matter. Meanwhile, the opposition PDP has kicked against the decision saying, “it was an affront on the people of the state who made their choice.” While speaking to journalists on Tuesday, the state PDP chairman,  Alhaji Hamza Koshe Akuyam, said they are disappointed with the court order. “We have won our elections and we have all the records with us from the polling units to wards and local government levels.  We are not scared of any outcome. We are only calling on our supporters to remain calm and law-abiding despite all the provocations by the APC,” he said.
