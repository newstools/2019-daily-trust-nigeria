The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) are forging new ways to fight economic crimes. The two bodies met yesterday at the head office of the CBN in Abuja and had in attendance management staff of both entities. A statement from the CBN said the two agencies are collaborating on several fronts including “anti-money laundry and the monitoring of politically exposed persons in the country.” It said the meeting “provided an opportunity for the two entities to share experiences and peculiar challenges in the fight against economic-related crimes.” “The two agencies adopted strategies aimed at curtailing the unwholesome activities of economic saboteurs which include smuggling of commodities like rice, textile materials, fertilizer, wheat, and other items on the prohibition list for accessing foreign exchange through the official window, as well as tracking illicit financial flows” the statement indicated. The inter-agency meeting, chaired by the Director, Governors’ Department of the CBN, Mr. Jeremiah Abue, also agreed to improve the level of information-sharing and surveillance of the financial sector, the statement indicated. It would be recalled that the CBN under the auspices of the Bankers’ Committee had said that any individual or corporate body found to complicit in economic crime or attempts to circumvent economic laws and regulations of the country may be barred from operating a bank account in any bank in Nigeria.
