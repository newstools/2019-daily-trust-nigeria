Six militants escaped when police raided a residential house used as a training and recruitment centre for terror activities in Kwale county in coastal Kenya on Friday. Tom Odero, Kwale Police Commander, said that the militants numbering six escaped after a fierce gun battle. Odero said the militants had sneaked into the country through porous Boni Forest from Somalia before setting up the training ground in the area. “This must have been a training ground for terror-related activities for some time. “We are currently pursuing them and we are sure we will get hold of them soon,” Odero said. According to Odero, the police recovered assorted items including bomb making materials during the dawn raid conducted by anti-terror police. He said a thorough operation had been launched in the area to hunt the militants. Other items recovered include military clothes, machetes, knives, cables, fertiliser, matchboxes and black flags.
Odero said the police also recovered stationary including books and notes with religious writings. Kenya is currently engaged in the fight against the militia group in southern Somalia where its soldiers under the AU peacekeeping mission have intensified fight against the insurgents.
