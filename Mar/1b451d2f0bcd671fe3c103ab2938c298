The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), yesterday, said it was internally auditing beneficiaries of its Fast Track scheme for the approval of Form ‘M’s and the issuance of Pre-Arrival Assessment Reports (PAAR) at the PAAR Ruling Centre. The Form ‘M’ and the PAAR are key instrument customs uses to document details of imported consignments for the purpose of inspection and duty payment. The service was yet to approve release of the form or issue PAAR, recently, saying the delay was in the interest of stakeholders. The public relations officer, Joseph Attah, in a statement said, “the delay being experienced in the process of Form ‘M’ and PAAR now is due to internal auditing of Fast-Track beneficiaries which hitherto made up 20 per cent in order to fish out the non-compliant beneficiaries. “NCS has now put in place modalities to identify this group of beneficiaries with a bid to removing them from the scheme while compliant ones continue to enjoy the fast track facility,” he noted in the statement. The Service assured that normal speed in process will be restored immediately the backlog accumulated due to this intervention is cleared from the system. Timelines for approval of Form ‘M’ and issuance of PAAR were approved by the Customs Comptroller-General, retired Col. Hameed Ibrahim Ali, in April 2018.
