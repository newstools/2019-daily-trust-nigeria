Following the court ruling on Monday that nullified Engineer Abba Kabir Yusuf as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) gubernatorial candidate in Kano state, the PDP candidate has revealed that the ruling does not in any way affect his candidature as the case is against PDP, which he said the party has taken the most appropriate action of appeal to address it. This was contained in a statement issued and signed by spokesman to the Kano PDP candidate, Malam Sunusi Bature Dawakin Tofa. According to the statement, as far as the candidate is concern, his campaign activities will continue till Thursday night when the deadline of campaigns will elapse as contained in the Electoral Act 2010 as amended. “Engineer Abba Kabir Yusuf remains the candidate of the People Democratic Party for the 2019 coming election on Saturday 9th of March, 2019. “The case has nothing to do with the flag-bearer of the party, it is an internal issue with one of the aspirants and the party has taken the next step,” it added. Similarly, the party also accused the ruling APC in the state as being behind the issue. “We are surprised that the news of the judgement came from the mouthpiece of Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, via social media before the court ruling was delivered. “It is a fact that the ruling party (APC) is behind the scene on this case; they are determined to frustrate the opposition ahead of Saturday’s polls for the fear of the unknown,” it added. It also called on all members of PDP and the teaming supporters of Engr. Abba Kabir Yusuf to remain calm and move forward with electioneering campaigns to ensure victory for the party come this Saturday.
