The President, Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE), Mr Adekunle Mokuolu, on Saturday inaugurated the Bwari branch of the society in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Mokuolum, who warned Nigerians against patronage of quack engineers, also called on registered engineers to ensure strict adherence to professional engineering standards. The theme of the investiture ceremony was ‘Reminiscences of Infrastructural Failures in Nigeria: Building collapse in Focus’. Fourteen engineers were inducted into the society at the ceremony. The president charged the new members saying “I want you to put together your efforts and professional knowledge and resources to the development of Bwari and Nigeria at large.” The guest speaker, Prof Danladi Matawal, FNSE, called for zero tolerance for quackery which, he said, had become embarrassing to the profession. He also called for training and retraining of site engineers and enlightenment programmes for artisans as a short term solution to the challenges facing the industry. “We are deficient in artisans and art craftsmen who if knowledgeable enough will correct some of the errors in design in the site and resist directives from corrupt and ambitious developers who want to cut corners. The Executive Secretary, Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA), Mr Umar Gambo Jibrin, said the issue of collapse building had reduced in the city, it was still a source worry. NAN He said a technical committee had been set up to investigate remote and immediate causes of the collapses. He added that the FCDA was making efforts to weed out quackery through full enforcement of engineering regulations.
