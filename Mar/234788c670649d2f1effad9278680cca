The gubernatorial candidate of the PDP in Kano State, Engr. Abba Kabir Yusuf, has assured his supporters of emerging victorious in the forthcoming gubernatorial re-run in the state. A statement signed by Yusuf’s spokesman, Sanusi Bature Dawakin Tofa, said: “The people of Kano have seen glaringly how some enemies of democracy who are ranking officials in Kano State government including the Deputy Governor, Dr. Nasiru Yusuf Gawuna, Commissioner for Local Government, Murtala Sule Garo and Chairman of Nassarawa Local Government, Alhaji Lamin Sani vandalised an election collation centre, resulting to truncating the declaration of the result to deny PDP victory.” Dawakin Tofa alleged that the PDP was aware of the 500 ballot papers printed by the Kano State Printing Press and syndicated to various polling units across the state, part of which 10 cartons were intercepted by the police. “It is our prayer that all election offenders will be charged to court at the earliest time to serve as deterrent to anti-democracy,” he said. He appealed to all PDP supporters to remain calm, as according to him, the party was on the verge of forming the next government in Kano State.
