The Sustainable Democracy Agenda (SUDA), yesterday, called on all senators-elect irrespective of political parties to throw their weight behind the bid of Senator Ahmad Lawan for the position of president of the 9th Senate. A statement by the convener of the group, Ibrahim Haruna Usman, said the call became important for the incoming Senate to be united and vibrant unlike the present Senate which has remained disunited since inauguration. The statement said “Our position on this is in line with the Senate Rule because findings have shown that Senator Lawan is presently the most experienced of all the senators-elected on the platform of the majority All Progressives Congress (APC) and he has remained one of the most productive lawmakers since the beginning of the present dispensation in 1999. “Our decision to drum support for the senator also follows painstaking investigation on his personal pedigree and integrity, both characteristics presently in short supply in our polity. “The distinguished senator is of highest academic qualification and has never been found wanting on the ground of fraud or breach of legislative processes,” he said. The group said Senator Lawan deserved to lead the next Senate after his exemplary performance as Leader of the present Senate. “As keen observers of the polity, we watched with admiration how the senator exhibited maturity in his dealings with Senate President Bukola Saraki while marshalling support for the agenda of President Muhammadu Buhari by remaining loyal to the majority APC.
