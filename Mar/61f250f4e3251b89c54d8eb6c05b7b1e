The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), says it will not rescind its decision on the use of biometrics in the conduct of its Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME). This is contained in the board’s weekly bulletin issued on Sunday in Lagos. According to the bulletin the importance of biometrics in the conduct of the board’s examination cannot be overemphasised. It noted that the Biometrics Verification Machine (BVM) was introduced by the board in an attempt to get rid of the numerous forms of examination malpractice. It said the BVM was a security mechanism used for the authentication of candidates’ identity as it provided access to the individual data, based on physiological characteristics. “The core value of a biometric verification process lies in its ability to provide extra layers of security and protection against counterfeiting and impersonation. “The increasing threat of identity fraud during the board’s UTME before the advent of the BVM necessitated its introduction for capturing biometrics of candidates to counter fraud. “The candidate’s 10 fingers are captured during registration and are used as clearance to admit them into the examination hall. “There are various types of biometric solutions but JAMB opted for finger print recognition, to eliminate all forms of infractions. “Biometric security is surely a breakthrough for the board, because the finger prints recognition technology provides a greater degree of security as it is impossible to steal, forget, loose or compromise data already captured. “Therefore, the adoption of biometrics in the conduct of our examination is here to stay,” the bulletin noted. It reassured candidates that their finger prints would not be used for any purpose other than identification.
