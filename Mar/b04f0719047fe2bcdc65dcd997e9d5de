The Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar III and Bishop of Sokoto Dioceses, Mathew Hassan Kukah, have urged politicians to work together towards a violence-free supplementary election in Sokoto state. The duo spoke at the town hall meeting for stakeholders organized by the National Peace Committee ahead of Saturday supplementary election in  the state. Sultan said: “As Muslims, we know power comes from God, we should not go on killing ourselves because we cannot force God to change His will.” The monarch admonished politicians to ensure a peaceful supplementary election devoid of violence in the state. Represented by the Wazirin Sokoto, Professor Sambo Junaidu, the royal father urged the electorate to vote for the right person who would make effort to develop the state. In his goodwill message, Bishop Kukah wondered why those trying to govern the state should instigate violence. “What you don’t wish your enemy, you should not wish it for another person. God knows the next Governor,” he said. He decried attitude and behaviours of some politicians which were inimical to peace. In his address, the Resident Electoral Commission of INEC, Abubakar Sadiq, blamed politicians for the violence recorded in part of the state during the governorship election which led to the cancellation of result from some polling units. According to him, one of their staff lost his hand as he was attacked by hoodlums in Kebbe local government area. He reiterated their commitment to free, fair and transparent supplementary election in the state.
