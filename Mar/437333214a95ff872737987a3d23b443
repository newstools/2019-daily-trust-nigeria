The All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) has urged Nigerians to sustain their support for President Muhammadu Buhari in his second term, saying the results of his economic initiatives will soon translate to stable economy and better living standard for the citizenry. The National Chairman of APGA, Dr. Victor Ike Oye, told newsmen, yesterday, in Abuja that it was important for Nigerians to give moral and spiritual support to the president by praying for him. He said the president deserved complete eight years as provided by the constitution. He also scored the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) high for the smooth conduct of the 2019 general elections. According to him, it was lamentable that some Nigerians spent their time criticizing the president, warning that politics was not a do or die affair, and  that desperate politics was what caused violence during elections. “Nigerians must learn how to cooperate with those in leadership position in the country, it is by this understanding that the unity and peace of the country can be promoted irrespective of race and religion,” Oye said.
