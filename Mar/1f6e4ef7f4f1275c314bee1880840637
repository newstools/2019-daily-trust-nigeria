At least 58 people have been killed in flash floods in the eastern Indonesian province of Papua. Rescue workers are struggling to reach remote parts of the province, and there are fears the number of dead may rise. Roads have been blocked by landslides and fallen trees, and floodwaters have damaged two bridges and more than 100 houses. More than 4,000 people have been forced from their homes, and some are sheltering in government offices. Residents said torrential rain began on Saturday and continued into the night, triggering mudslides and flash floods. “Our house was flooded with thick mud… we immediately grabbed our valuables and ran to a neighbour’s [two-storey] house to seek refuge,” said mother-of-two Lili Puji Hastuti.
