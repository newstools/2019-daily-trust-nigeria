India, Pakistan, Cameroon, Egypt, China, Iran, Niger Republic and Bangladesh have indicated interest to participate in the 40th edition of the Kaduna International Trade Fair, the 2nd Deputy President of the Kaduna Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (KADCCIMA), Alhaji Suleiman Aliyu has said. Addressing a press conference on Monday, he disclosed that President Muhammadu Buhari is slated to declare the trade fair open on 30th March, 2019. He said “the fair, earlier schedule for February was shifted to March because of the changes in the election time table.” He informed that the chamber is already in contact with industrialists, manufacturers, producers, fabricators, distributors and marketers, both within and outside the country, inviting them to come and participate at this year’s fair. According to him, “This year’s fair would focus majorly on how to blend agriculture and industry together in such a way that it can improve the economy of the country away from oil. “The unique thing, though we are building on the previous themes, is to see how we can connect agriculture with industry. We are focusing on agriculture and industry because of the discrepancies that have existed between the two over the years. “We are going to be identifying with less privileged members of the society, host community and commissioning of projects, organised some personalities who have contributed to the KADCCIMA since its inception four decades ago as well as the prospects of businesses in Nigeria. “We should not forget that, Kaduna State was recently rated top in ease of doing business. That would not have happened without the input of KADCCIMA and we are happy and proud of that achievement.” 40th Kaduna trade fair begins next month Glo lights up Kaduna trade fair India, Pakistan, Hungary to partake  in Kaduna fair
