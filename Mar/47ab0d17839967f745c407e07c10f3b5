Hundreds of protesters have marched through the Algerian capital demanding President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s immediate resignation. On Monday, the president postponed the 18 April presidential elections and dropped his bid for a fifth term. Protesters are accusing the president of a ploy to prolong his 20-year rule. Talks have been set up to negotiate Algeria’s political future, which will be led by veteran UN diplomat Lakhdar Brahimi.
