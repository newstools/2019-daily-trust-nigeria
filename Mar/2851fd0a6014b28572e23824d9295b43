The Federal Executive Council (FEC) has approved that Aso Rock becomes an eligible customer so it can get direct electricity supply from Shiroro hydropower Generation Company (GenCo) within six months. A statement by Hakeem Bello, the spokesman for Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola today, said the approvals were gotten after Fashola presented memos at the meetings. The Eligible Customer Regulation issued by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) in 2017, permits electricity consumer to buy power directly from Generation Companies (GenCos). Aso Rock Villa, the official residence of the President will benefit from this as FEC, last Wednesday, approved the inclusion of the Villa in the Distribution Expansion Programme (DEP) meant to off-take part of stranded 2,000 megawatts (MW) to provide a dedicated power. The Ministry obtained approval from the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP) for the DEP to commence civil works at the Villa for power installations that will guarantee uninterrupted power supply to the Villa. The statement said within the next six months, the contractor, Dextron Engineering Limited under the DEP, will complete the project. Government has arranged with North-South Power Company, operator of Shiroro hydropower GenCo to supply dedicated power to the Villa while Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC), a sister company will ensure the project’s success.
