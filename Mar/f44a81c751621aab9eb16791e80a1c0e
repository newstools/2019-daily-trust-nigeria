The All Progressives Congress’ governorship candidate in Kwara State, Alhaji AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, yesterday said he would repeal the law granting pensions to former governors and free up resources for the masses, if elected. Abdulrazak said this during his campaign stop at Omu Aran in Kwara South and at Pategi in Kwara North. He said: “We need to change some terrible laws. We’ll repeal that obnoxious pension law when we get to office. It’s a privilege to become a governor of a state. “It is dubious for anyone to become governor and then earn a pension more than people who served the state for their entire lives. We can’t take that anymore. But we need enough lawmakers to push through the repeal of the offensive law.” AbdulRazaq vows to repeal Kwara’s ex-governors’ pension law I’ll stop jumbo pensions of Saraki, ex-Govs, deputies in Kwara — APC guber candidate ‘Why Kwara Express workers resisted privatization’
