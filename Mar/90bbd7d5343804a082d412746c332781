Mozambique said five cases of cholera had been confirmed around the badly damaged port city of Beira, after a powerful cyclone killed more than 700 people across a swath of Southern Africa. Cyclone Idai smashed into Mozambique at around midnight on March 14 before tearing through neighbouring Zimbabwe and Malawi, displacing hundreds of thousands of people and wrecking an area of 3,000sq km. The relief focus has increasingly turned to preventing or containing what many believe will be inevitable outbreaks of diseases like malaria and cholera.
