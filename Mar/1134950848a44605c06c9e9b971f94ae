The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) chairmanship candidate in the March 9, 2019 election in Abaji Area Council, Alhaji Mohammed  Inuwa Ashafa,  has said he will seek for legal redress after he studied the election results in the area. INEC had last Saturday declared the incumbent chairman of the council,  Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya of the APC, as winner of the chairmanship election after he polled 13, 442 votes against  Ashafa who scored 10, 473 votes. Ashafa,  while  speaking with newsmen in Abuja yesterday, said he was  dissatisfied with the outcome of the  chairmanship election, alleging that it was marred by irregularities. He alleged that the ruling APC engaged in vote buying across various polling units, adding that some PDP stalwarts and supporters were intimidated, while some were arrested and taken into police custody a week before the election. “What I am more bothered about was the cancellation of some polling units which are my strongholds,  but we are gathering all the evidence before we will go and seek for redress,” he said. Reacting,  the Abaji APC chairman, Alhaji Haruna Mohammed Yaba,  said he challenged the PDP to present where the APC engaged in voting buying or intimidated the opposition during the elections. He said  the victory of APC was as a result of performance of the council administration  and vigorous campaign in all the nooks and crannies of the council.
