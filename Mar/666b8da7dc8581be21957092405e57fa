The Federal Government is to develop necessary technology to promote innovation and make research by its agencies to be industry-driven. The Minister of Science and Technology, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, disclosed this when President of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Engr. Mansur Ahmed, paid him courtesy visit in his office in Abuja. Dr. Onu said henceforth, research efforts by the ministry will be industry-driven and targeted at national needs, adding that was to enable Nigeria stop the importation of what it could produce internally. He further said his ministry has produced a leather policy that is expected to boost the leather industry and spearhead industrialization in the country. The minister also said that the BT cotton variety recently developed by the ministry’s agency – National Biotechnology Development Agency – will go a long way in resuscitating our moribund textile industry and rejuvenating our cotton sector. Through the Natural Strategy for Competitiveness in Raw Materials, the minister added that the sum of N2.6 trillion would be saved for the country in the next five years. Earlier, the president of MAN said the association wants a public private partnership (PPP) with the ministry for the purpose of improving and adding value to raw materials so as to boost industrialization. According to the MAN president, the collaboration will help develop sub-sectors of the economy which have the potentials to end the importation of finished products and create jobs. Engr. Ahmed used the opportunity to invite the minister to its forthcoming 3-day Expo with the theme ‘Optimizing the Value-chain in the Manufacturing Sector to Achieve Growth’, adding that MAN would create the platform for mutual engagement of all stakeholders in the manufacturing sector.
