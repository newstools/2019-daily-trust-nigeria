The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has declared the Kuje Area Council chairmanship and councillorship elections inconclusive. INEC’s Returning Officer, Mrs. Zainab Gbefwi, told newsmen that the election was declared inconclusive due to electoral violence in Rubochi and Kabi wards of the council. She said the elections in some polling units of Rubochi and Kabi wards were cancelled as a result of non usage of card readers. According her, INEC materials were destroyed and some ad hoc staff were also injured in the course of the violence that occurred. “At the end of collation, there was no clear winner because the candidate that had the majority votes had one-quarter of two-thirds of the votes cast. “But the difference between the candidate with the majority votes and the next candidate is very small as compared to the number of registered voters and votes cancelled,” she said. The returning officer said that re-run elections will take place in the two affected wards, saying the date for the re-run would be announced later after consultations with the FCT Resident Electoral Officer.
