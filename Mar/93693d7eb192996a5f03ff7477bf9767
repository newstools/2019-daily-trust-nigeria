A 14-year-old school girl has died allegedly from drug overdose in Kurudu area of Abuja. The teenager (name withheld) died on Tuesday night. Neighbours who spoke to our reporter said that the deceased took the drugs, which our reporter could not verify, and started having stomach upset and went to lie down. “Her parents were not yet back from work so there was nobody to take her to the hospital. By the time her mother came back from work, it was too late, as the girl died while sleeping,” Ifeoma Ezeigbo, a neighbour said. Our reporter gathered that the deceased who was the only daughter of her parents was a former student of Higher Glory Academy in Kurudu where she was allegedly expelled over her drug use. She was however taken to Government Secondary School Karu, where she allegedly found bad company and continued with the drug abuse. According to one of her friends, who did not want to be named, her drug disorder was a public issue but which she always denied. He said he was however shocked that her death was being related to drug overdose. She was buried on Wednesday morning according to Islamic rites.  5 children missing in Abuja in 4 months Codeine abuse spreads among Kano women Power tussle turns FRCN Kaduna into battleground -    ...cops force airing of KTSG programme
