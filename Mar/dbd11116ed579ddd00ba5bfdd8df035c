The Governor of Kaduna State, Malam Nasir El-Rufai has asked Nigerians to discountenance false messages attributed to him on social media. The governor, in a statement by his spokesman, Samuel Aruwan, said he had no connection with the messages that are being falsely ascribed to him. He said: “Certain persons regularly practise their bigotry by posting untrue messages regarding Malam Nasir Rl-Rufai on social media. They have now escalated this rascally behaviour to concocting messages and attributing them to him. This is irresponsible and most unacceptable. “All through his public life, Malam Nasir El-Rufai has acquired a reputation for expressing himself frankly and firmly. His views are projected through authorised statements signed by his official spokesman, or on his verified social media platforms, where he has a strong presence. Any statement that is not from these channel should be disregarded.” The governor said since Nigerians voted for President Muhammadu Buhari, adding that those who lost the election had intensified their attempts to divide the country along ethnic, religious and regional lines.
