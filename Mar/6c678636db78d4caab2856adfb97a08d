An Ilorin Magistratesâ€™ Court on Monday remanded two suspects, Kazeem Aliu and Shafiu Sulyman, for allegedly being members of a secret cult. The accused are standing trial on a three-count charge of criminal conspiracy, being in possession of criminal charms and being members of a secret cult. They, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge against them. The Prosecutor, Insp. Nasiru Yusuf, told the court that the accused persons were arrested on Feb. 20. Yusuf said the arrest followed a distress call from the authority of Kwara State College of Education about secret cult activities going on within the school premises. He said that when the police stormed the scene of the crime, the duo was arrested and when they were searched some criminal charms were found on them. The prosecutor said that the alleged offence contravened Sections 97 and 217 of the Penal Code Law, and Section 14 of Secret Cult and Secret Society Law, 2016. He prayed the court to remand the accused persons in prison custody as investigation was ongoing to arrest others at large. The Chief Magistrate, Ibrahim Mohammed, ordered the remand of the accused persons at Mandala Prisons, Ilorin, and adjourned the case till March 21 for mention.
