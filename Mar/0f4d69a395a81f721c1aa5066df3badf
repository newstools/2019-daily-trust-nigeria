The Socioeconomic and Environment Advocacy Centre (SEAC) has called for the recognition of vendors as lawful residents of cities, who are legally entitled to organizing livelihoods and making contributions to the cities’ gross domestic products. The centre arrived at the position at a roundtable they organised recently, where the participants after listening to a resource person, Dr. Onyanta Adama, called for the recognition of street economic work and the rights of street economic workers in cities. The Executive Director of the centre, Prof. Mohammed Bello Yunusa, in a statement urged governments to put an end to street workers harassment in Abuja and other cities. He tasked the urban management agencies to strategise new ways to accommodate the vendors in the cities through space provision, adding that the agencies needed to provide support infrastructure for the vendors and manage informalities to make the cities more inclusive. The centre assured that such actions would strengthen the revenue base of the cities including Abuja. The discussion, which was chaired by Norma Perchonock, a senior research fellow at CEDDERT, was attended by academics, SEAC and public agencies and Development Agencies  Abuja vendors cry for help Meet dwellers of Abuja’s Ajegunle Shutdown: Sex workers go into hiding in Umuahia
