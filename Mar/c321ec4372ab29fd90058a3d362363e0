All is set for the official declaration of House Leader, Femi Gbajabiamila (APC, Lagos) to contest for the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives in the incoming 9th Assembly. The event, slated for Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja, would kick off at 2 pm. This is even as the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), which also has majority of lawmakers in both the Senate and House of Reps, is yet to zone the Number Four Citizen slot to any section of the country. By declaring officially, however, the fourth term lawmaker, would be joining a cohort of over 16 other lawmakers who have shown interest in occupying the topmost job in the Green Chamber. He will also become the first contestant from the South, comprising South East, South West and South South geopolitical zones, to officially disclose his interest in the position. In a declaration speech obtained by Daily Trust, Gbajabiamila highlighted, among other things, his legislative background and pedigree, as major reason for seeking the office currently occupied by Yakubu Dogara (PDP, Bauchi). “With all sense of humility, I seek this office (House Speaker) with a rich legislative background and pedigree, having just won a historic fifth term mandate to the House,” text of the official declaration stated.
