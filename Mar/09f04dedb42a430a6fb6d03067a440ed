The police in Abuja on Monday arraigned a mechanic, Monday Boniface, who allegedly stole a car gear box, two tyres and some other motor parts from another mechanic. Boniface, who resides at Karmo, Abuja, is facing a three-count charge bordering on theft before a Karmo Grade 1 Area  Court. He, however, pleaded not guilty. According to the prosecutor,  Mrs Ijeoma Ukagha,  Boniface stole the motor parts from Mr Ade Obanye on Feb. 26. Ukagha said that  Boniface and Obanye worked together  at a mechanic’s workshop at Jabi, Abuja, where Obanye kept the items. She said that at  3:00p.m. on Feb. 26, Obanye came to the workshop and discovered that the items were  missing. “The complainant  said the defendant could not give satisfactory account of the missing car parts when asked. “Police investigation revealed that the defendant formed a criminal intention and stole the said items, all valued at N70,000,” she said. She noted  that the offence contravened Section 287 of the Penal Code. The judge, Alhaji Inuwa Maiwada, granted the defendant  bail in the sum of N100, 000 with one surety in like sum. Maiwada ordered that the surety must reside within the jurisdiction of the court. He adjourned the case until April 2, for substantive hearing.
