The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has allayed fears that the proposed national micro finance bank will crowd out existing microfinance banks across the country. Mr. Emefiele was speaking, yesterday, while inspecting facilities at the NIRSAL Micro Finance Bank under construction at the NIPOST premises, Gwagwalada, Abuja. The national micro finance bank which is hoped will promote access to credit finance for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and other unbanked groups in the country, is being promoted by the CBN, in collaboration with the Bankers Committee, the Nigeria Incentive-based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL) and the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST). The NIRSAL MFB is among the first such venture. “The existing microfinance banks are doing their best and I’ve heard this is an attempt to crowd them out but this is not an attempt to crowd them out. It is to complement their services and see to it that whatever services are provided by these microfinance banks should be fair to their customers,” he said. “I also know rural communities where the microfinance banks charge very prohibitive interest rates but here we are talking about making fund available to these people. This will help to create some form of competitive landscape so that those kinds of practices will no longer arise,” he explained further. He said the capital base for the national microfinance bank is N5bn and the target is 774 branches that will be located in all the local governments in the country.
