The Transition Company of Nigeria (TCN) said on Monday that arrangements have been concluded by the company to acquire two new technology driven helicopters for surveillance and fixing of faults across its transmission line network in the country. The TCN chief executive officer, Usman Mohammed, said the company was only awaiting the disposal of the four grounded helicopters acquired by the defunct Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) before the acquisition of the new choppers Speaking in Lagos at the commencement of training of 600 engineers of TCN by National Power Training Institute of Nigeria (NAPTIN), Mohammed said the company had recruited a transaction adviser who is working to determine the value of the equipment, stressing that until the value is given, the helicopters and other obsolete equipment cannot put  into the market. He noted that the only problem in the nation’s power sector is the distribution sub-sector, stressing that the only solution to the problem is the recapitalization of the distribution company for efficient delivery of power. NAPTIN acting Director General Ahmed Nagote noted that 600 staff of TCN had been slated for training in three batches of transmission lines construction and maintenance; transformer maintenance, as the second, and power system protection.
