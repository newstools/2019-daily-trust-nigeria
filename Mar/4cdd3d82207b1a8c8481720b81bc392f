The Lagos State Muslim Pilgrims’ Welfare Board yesterday urged intending pilgrims for the 2019 hajj to complete their payment of their fare on or before April 15, 2019. The Secretary of the Board, Mr Ishola Rahman, said this would enable the state to make necessary arrangement to facilitate their participation in the Hajj exercise. As quoted in a statement by the Board’s Public Relations Officer, Jamiu Dosunmu, Rahman explained that prompt payment of the fare would aid the smooth operation of this year’s hajj. He said that when all the intending pilgrims complete their payment in earnest, the board would be able to secure standard accommodation, quality tent in Mina and other arrangements for them in Saudi Arabia. The Secretary observed that late payment was one of the major causes of hitches identified in previous hajj operations. He said that the board was fully ready for biometric capturing as it awaits directive from the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) to announce the date. Rahman also advised intending pilgrims to be fully prepared for the usual weekend lectures designed to equip them with the dos and don’ts of the Hajj operation, adding the lecture would start at various local government secretariats across the state.
