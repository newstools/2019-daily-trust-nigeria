The Governorship candidate of African Action Congress (AAC), Mr. Awara Biokpmabo, has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to declare him winner of the Rivers State governorship candidate. The Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi and his faction of the All Progressive Congress, APC in Rivers adopted Biokpomabo during the Saturday election in the state The AAC candidate alleged that from the results collated and declared from different Local Government Areas collation centres,  he was in clear lead and was coasting to victory before INEC suspended the exercise in the State. He spoke at a press briefing in Port Harcourt on Monday. He said that some of the results announced at the polling units in the Local Government  Areas where collations were not concluded clearly show that he won over 15 Local Government Areas. He alleged that the suspension of the election was done to give respite to the candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP),Governor Nyesom Wike. He said, “No wonder when they saw that I was leading and would eventually win the election, they raised a false alarm to the Headquarter of the Commission and misinformed them that there was widespread violence and seizure of electoral materials.” Rivers APC: Amaechi, Abe  factions disagree over adoption of AAC candidate Re-run elections: Rivers political warlords return to trenches INEC declares Atiku winner in Oyo
