The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has demanded the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to cancel the March 23 Kano State supplementary election following massive thumb-printing and ballot stuffing by the All Progressives Congress, APC. The PDP, in a statement on Saturday by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, said all material facts on the rerun poll in the state showed that “rampaging APC thugs violently took over polling units, attacked and chased away voters and engaged in massive thumb-printing and ballot stuffing” for the APC. “INEC is already aware that the Police arrested the Kano State Commissioner for Special Duties, Muktar Yakasai alongside APC thugs he led to disrupt election in Yelwa in Dala Local Government area of the State. “Also, INEC is already aware of how APC thugs attacked voters in polling units in Gama area of Kano state during which four PDP members were feared killed and many more injured before they carted away ballot boxes for stuffing for the APC. “The PDP cautions INEC to note that in this circumstance, any results they come out with from this convoluted electoral process will be a sham and will surely be rejected by the people of Kano State. “It is completely reprehensible that the APC and Governor Abdullahi Ganduje would resort to violence and bloodletting as a means to attempt to hold on to power after they have been rejected by the people. “The PDP therefore, charges INEC to save the nation from crisis by cancelling the Kano supplementary election, as failure to do so is not in the best interest of our dear nation,” the PDP said.
