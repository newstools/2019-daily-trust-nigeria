The chairmanship candidate of the People Democratic Party (PDP) in Saturday supplementary election, Ibrahim Daniel, has rejected the result of the chairmanship supplementary election in the area council. INEC had declared APC candidate,  Danladi Bomboyi Chiya, winner of the election. Daniel, while reacting to the chairmanship election, described the supplementary election as ‘scam of the year’ by the APC-led administration. He alleged that some suspected thugs invaded a polling unit and smashed the card reader in the presence of some security agents and disrupted the entire process. He claimed that none of the thugs was arrested by the armed security operatives at the polling unit. He said the declaration of the APC candidate was a premeditated move by INEC and security personnel to thwart the will of the good people of the area, saying he will meet the party stakeholders after studying the results to challenge the election at the tribunal. The chairmanship candidate, therefore, called on his supporters and members of the PDP to remain calm and be law abiding to constituted authorities in the area, saying he will surely seek for legal redress to take back his stolen mandate. Reacting, the Kwali APC chairman, Alhaji Aliyu Sheda, described the allegations raised by the PDP candidate as baseless, saying the ruling APC was unperturbed over the PDP’s move to seek legal redress. He denied that APC connived with security agents and INEC to disrupt the supplementary election.
