A former Commissioner for Energy in Lagos, Mr Wale Oluwo, yesterday assured the people of Epe that the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Mr Jimi Agbaje, would continue the projects started by outgoing governor, Akinwunmi Ambode. Oluwo had resigned from Ambode’s cabinet to join the PDP. He also assured that some land acquisitions in the Epe and Lekki-Ajah axes would be reviewed if the PDP won the Lagos governorship on Saturday. Oluwo, an Epe indigene, assured the people yesterday at a rally for the Agbaje governorship campaign at the Marina beach area of the town that the infrastructural projects begun by the incumbent governor would not be abandoned under Agbaje. “Agbaje and his Deputy have assured me that they will continue the good work that Ambode began in Epe but has not been allowed to finish,” he said. Agbaje’s running mate, Mrs Haleemat Oluwayemisi Busari, whose paternal roots are in Epe, also assured her kinsmen that there would be no abandoned project in the town. Agbaje himself said his regime would prioritise human capital and infrastructural development in Lagos State. av Lagos guber: How Sanwo-Olu will lock horns with Agbaje in 2019 How Lagos guber candidates are shaping up for  battle BREAKING!!!
