Elites Network for Sustainable Development (ENetSuD), a Kwara-based Civil Society Organization, has tasked the incoming administration in the state that good governance, transparency and accountability, prompt payment of salaries, and human and infrastructural development be the hallmarks of the new government. This was contained in a statement issued yesterday by the group in Ilorin signed by its coordinator, Dr Alagbonsi Abdullateef. The statement read, “We would also like to remind you all, that like many other concerned Kwarans, we would be monitoring the Federal and State Budget to ensure that monies are used only for what they are budgeted for. The account of our monitoring activities will be made available to the public and some appropriate authorities, if necessary, in order to ensure that government do not waver in its duties to the people.” Tge group also applauded the electorates for the peaceful manner in which they conducted themselves during and after the elections and commends the spirit of sportsmanship exhibited by the opposition parties, which has greatly promoted harmony in the state after the election.
