The chief executive of Volkswagen has apologised for evoking a Nazi slogan to describe the importance of boosting the group’s profits. Herbert Diess used the line “Ebit macht frei” at a company event on Tuesday. The phrase echoes the maxim “Arbeit Macht Frei” – meaning “work sets you free” – which was famously emblazoned in wrought-iron on the gates of the Auschwitz concentration camp. Ebit is a commonly used acronym for “earnings before interest and taxes”. In a statement, Mr Diess said he was sorry for what he described as “definitely an unfortunate choice of words”. He said he was referring to the freedom afforded to VW brands in strong financial health, and added: “At no time was it my intention for this statement to be placed in a false context. At the time, I simply did not think of this possibility.” Inside Nazi concentration camp Changing face of fun little Volkswagen Beetle Volkswagen to produce 2m cars in Nigeria — MD
