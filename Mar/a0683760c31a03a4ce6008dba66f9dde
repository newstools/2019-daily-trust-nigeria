The Governorship candidate of the Accord party in Abia state, Bar. Emeka Uwakolam has joined forces with Alex Otti of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) to kick out the incumbent governor Okezie Ikpeazu. Uwakolam believes that, since he shared the same ideology and objective with Otti, it would be better for him to loan him his structure for the forth coming election. He disclosed this in a joint press conference with Otti at his party Office in Umuahia. Uwakolam, who narrated that his decision was not induced, said he considered a lot of variables before arriving at the conclusion that Otti was the best choice, given he had no god father behind him. He emphasised that his party or structure was not collapsing with APGA, but has only chosen to support and form alliance with someone with genuine desire to move the state forward. According to him, with his support and those of his support groups with over 100,000 membership, nothing will stop the APGA candidate from winning the polls. In his response, Mr. Otti, who was visibly elated, commended his former counterpart for his humility and courage in approaching him for the alliance. He corroborated the statement of Ukanwoke that there were no financial inducement at all, as the later rejected offers he made to him. Otti also said the state needed to be refocused and returned to God, saying that efforts should be made to abolish idolatry in the state. 2019: APGA pledges free and fair primaries in Abia ABIA: COURT STRIKES OUT UFOMBAâ€™S SUIT AGAINST APGA, OTTI APGA rejects Abia rerun results, to go to tribunal
