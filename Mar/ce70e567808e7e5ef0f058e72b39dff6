The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), yesterday, presented certificates of return to Delta State governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa and his deputy and running mate in the March 9, governorship election, Barr. Kingsley Otuaro. INEC also presented certificates of return to 24 of the 29 House of Assembly members-elect withholding four over “unresolved court cases.” Those withheld were the three constituencies won by the All Progressives Congress (APC) namely: Ethiope East, Ughelli North 1&2. It also withheld that of Ukwuani State Constituency, which was won by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Although Ndokwa North East constituency was not mentioned among those withheld, the member-elect and Deputy Speaker of the Delta State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Friday Osanebi, was conspicuously absent and therefore not presented with the certificate of return. Governor Okowa while receiving his certificate at the INEC office in Asaba, thanked Deltans, the electoral, security agencies and all those who played different roles during the elections. INEC’s National Commissioner, Dr. Mohammed Lecky, who presented the certificates of return, congratulated the governor and all those who won. “Today’s event is the highpoint of one of the legal requirements on the journey to assumption of office after being elected,” he said.
