By Shaba Abubakar Idris  At least 50 students of the University of Abuja, Gwagwalada, have been trained in Guosa language. Guosa language evolutionist, Prof. Alex Igbineweka, has engaged the 50 students on train-the-trainers basis for two weeks. Igbineweka, who spoke with City News during the programme at the permanent site of the university, said Guosa language was a common indigenous lingua franca in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). “Guosa Language is a scientific and artistic evolution of integration of all languages and dialects to be found in Nigeria and other West African nations,” he explained. He said the language is a medium of communication for unity, identity, tourism, political stability, culture, science and technological breakthrough. “Guosa language is now an international language that has gradually spread its tentacles in international academic institutions worldwide. The American Heritage University in Southern California has adopted it as a subject and anybody can apply to study Guosa language in the university,” he added. He appealed to the management of the National Universities Commission (NUC) to work with him to develop the Guosa language for the sake of posterity. Prof Igbineweka, however, advised students in the institutions of higher learning across the globe to deem it necessary to learn or study the language, saying that Guosa is a language that connects every ethnic group or every tribe in Nigeria. Also speaking during the train-the-trainers programme, a 200 level student in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Abuja, Adejumo Jumoke Grace, commended the initiator of the Guosa language for the steps taken to grow the language.
