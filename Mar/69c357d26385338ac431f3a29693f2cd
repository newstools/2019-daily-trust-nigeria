The Imo State governor-elect, Emeka Ihedioha, has attributed his victory in the March 9 governorship election as the resolve of the people of the state to take their destiny into their hands. Ihedioha, speaking at his maiden press briefing in Owerri, yesterday, described his election as historic. He said, “This election is as epochal as its outcome is momentous. It is a fervent protest against impunity and the celebrations in all the nooks and crannies of the state are a testimony to your belief in the rightness and wisdom of our vision for Imo State and the new path to progress which we shared with you during the campaigns.” Outgoing Governor Rochas Okorocha who had worked hard, including using a different political party to get his son-in-law, Uche Nwosu elected as governor but failed. The governor-elect also gave kudos “to our indefatigable team, men, women and youth who worked tirelessly, and gave their time, talents and resources freely in furtherance of the greater Imo dream.” While pledging to rebuild the state from the abyss of decay, he gave thanks “to the leaders, faithful members of the PDP who not only found me worthy of the governorship ticket, but worked assiduously to realise this dream.” He pledged to run an open, transparent and accountable government with due process as its hallmark.
