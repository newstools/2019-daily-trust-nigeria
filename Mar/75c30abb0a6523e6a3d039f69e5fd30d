The presidential candidate of the National Rescue Movement (NRM), Usman Ibrahim Alhaji, has sued President Muhammadu Buhari and the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, over campaign funds. In an ex parte application filed at the Federal High Court in Abuja, Alhaji sought for an order of the court nullifying the participation of Buhari and Atiku in the February 23 presidential poll for allegedly spending more than provided for by the Electoral Act in their campaigns. Counsel to Alhaji, Ezekiel Ofor, yesterday, asked the court to invoke Section 91(2) of the Electoral Act, 2010 to nullify the participation of Buhari and Atiku in the poll for allegedly violating the electoral laws. Alhaji contended that having spent more than the N1bn allowable under the law for their campaigns, including financial inducements, the two main rivals’ participation in the election ought to be set aside by the court. “A declaration that the 1st defendant unauthorized use of state resources brand-named ‘Tradermoni’ with which the 1st defendant through his running mate, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, has employed to tacitly induce the electorate in exchange for their votes amounts to fraud covered within Section 124 (1)(a);(b);(c); and Section 130 of the Electoral Act,” he said. Meanwhile, Justice Ahmed Mohammed had directed service of court processes on President Buhari, Atiku and other defendants. He adjourned the matter to March 26 for further mention.
