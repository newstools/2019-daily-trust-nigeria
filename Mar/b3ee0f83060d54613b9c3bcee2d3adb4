The All Progressives Congress (APC) national leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has commiserated with the families of victims of Wednesday’s building collapse at Ita-Faaji in Lagos Island, describing the incident as tragic. The former Lagos governor said the state government must ensure adequate treatment for rescued victims while he called on Lagosians to also donate blood to them. In the statement signed by his media aide, Tunde Rahman, the APC leader lamented that the school children lost to the building collapse did not deserve to die the way they did while he prayed for the repose of their souls. He urged the state government to fast-track demolition arrangement once a building is discovered to be weak and deserving of demolition in order to save lives. “While we await the inquiry into the circumstances that led to the incident, we must all support government’s intervention efforts. The Lagos State Material Testing Laboratory for buildings must be strengthened and the officers must do their work. “Government’s laid down regulations on building construction and maintenance must be faithfully respected and enforced. To mobilize support for these regulations, Community Development Associations need to come to government’s aid. “If after the collapsed building had been found to be weak and marked for demolition, everybody had done what was required of them, perhaps this terrible incident would have been averted,” he said. He therefore advised all to take appropriate lessons and learn from the sad incident.
