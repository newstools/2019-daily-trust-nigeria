The Peoplesâ€™ Democratic Party (PDP) has won 17 out of 30 seats in the Benue State House of Assembly thus leaving the All Progressives Congress (APC) with four seats so far as declared by INEC. Our correspondent obtained the record on Monday from the state INEC office in Makurdi. The record however indicated that the results of nine seats are inconclusive following cancellations of results or inability to hold exercises in affected areas. It was gathered that supplementary elections would hold in the remaining nine constituencies on March 23 alongside the governorship rerun exercise of the state. At least 432 candidates had participated in the Assembly polls across the state for the 30 available slots. The nine constituencies where winners are expected to emerge during the supplementary exercise include; Ado, Gwer East, Gboko East, Kastina-Ala West, Konshisha (Gaav), Obi, Okpokwu, Otukpo/Akpa and Ukum. PDP wins 17, APC takes 4 Assembly seats in Benue APC wins 15 assembly seats in Plateau, PDP eight Assembly polls: APC wins 28 seats in Bauchi, PDP 19 in Ondo
