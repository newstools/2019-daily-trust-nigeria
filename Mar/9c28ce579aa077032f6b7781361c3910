Members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kuje Area Council have accused the All Progressives Congress in the area of allegedly harbouring thugs in some hotels to disrupt the supplementary chairmanship election in some polling units in the council tomorrow. Addressing a press conference at the state party secretariat in Abuja, yesterday, the PDP Public Relations Officer (PRO) in Kuje, Sir Henry Ugbaja, alleged that some APC chieftains have already written results of all the polling units where the supplementary poll will take place. He said members of the ruling APC in the area were desperate to retain power during coming supplementary election, despite PDP having already won eight out of the 10 wards in the area. “The alliance with the Nigerian Army and other security agencies is to also intimidate voters on election day and use force to impose failed politicians on the people that have been rejected by their own people through the ballot,” he alleged. The party spokesman said they were ready to protect their votes, adding that violence has never developed any community and it will be highly regrettable to invoke violence in Kuje Area Council because some desperate politicians want to remain in power. Reacting, the spokesman APC in the FCT,  Engr.  Adaji Usman, described the allegations as a white lie from the pit of hell. He said members of the PDP were already known for raising false alarm. He said the allegations raised were all baseless, adding that the ruling APC would emerge victorious during the Saturday rerun election in the area. “Rubochi is a catchment area of the APC and that is where the chairman comes from. And we shall win with a landslide by the grace of God,” he said.  FCT poll holds tomorrow FCT poll holds tomorrow APC used thugs to win last FCT area council polls – Aduda
