Twenty five candidates from six political parties have signed the pledge cards for Vote4WASH, a citizen’s engagement advocacy project developed by communities in Plateau’s 17 local government areas to demand clean water, improved sanitation and hygiene (WASH) by those in elected positions. The 25 candidates are members of the ADP, ANN, APC, PDP, PPC and SDP including three governorship candidates, two senatorial candidates, six from the House of Representative, 13 from the Houses of Assembly and one local government chairman. The Project Officer and European Union (EU) Technical Assistant to Civil Society Organizations in Plateau State, Jephtha Daleng said in a statement that signing the pledge cards cut across the entire state and candidates from the political parties considered to have structures at the wards, local and state levels. Daleng said most of the candidates who signed the pledge cards were those vying for the state house of assembly seats, adding that the decision was deliberate considering the closeness of those offices to the communities. He said the campaign would be implemented in collaboration with a number of international, national and state CSO’s to use the 2019 general election and post-election period as an opportunity to highlight the availability and accessibility of clean water and hygienic services.
