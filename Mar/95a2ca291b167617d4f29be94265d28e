The Emir of Yauri, Muhammad Zayyanu Abdullahi, has called on the Federal Government to fulfil the promise made to his emirate to site an inland port and boat-making factory in Yauri. The emir, in a statement yesterday, said the government also promised to construct an irrigation system  and a road from Yelwa to Kainjiin in his emirate. The royal father said Yauri needed those projects in view of the devastation inflicted on the emirate during the construction of Kainji Dam back in the 60’s. He said: “The bulk of Kainji Lake that from the Dam is in Yauri Emirate and it led to the submerging of many settlements, islands including Gungun Hoge, Gungun Zamare and Gungun Ikum. “However, we must also give thanks to Almighty Allah for the establishment,by federal government the Hydroelectric Power Producing Areas Development Commission (HYPPADEC).” Why Yauri is home to every tribe in Nigeria – Emir of Yauri HYPPADEC states have  been neglected by FG -Yelwa Yauri Rigata: Kebbi community celebrates 200-year-old marine prowess
