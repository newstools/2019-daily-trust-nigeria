Ahead of the inauguration of the 9th National Assembly, a former Abia State governor and senator-elect for Abia North, Chief Orji Uzor Kalu, yesterday, vowed to contest for the position of the Senate president if the deputy Senate president is not ceded to the South East. He said he would respect the decision of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) which had zoned the Senate president’s position to the North East but asked for fairness for the South East. Kalu threatened to run for Senate president if the party denied the South East the position of the deputy Senate president. Speaking with newsmen, yesterday, at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), in Lagos, Kalu said it was only fair and just to allow the South East to produce the deputy Senate president. He also pledged to work to add value to Nigerians as a member of the National Assembly, saying his loyalty first and foremost was to the Nigerian people. He said he would bring his private sector experience to bear in galvanizing his colleagues to enact laws that would improve the country’s economy. The former governor said he learnt that the party ceded the DSP position to the North West which was not right. Kalu reiterated that he would make his intention known to the party’s leadership and President Muhammadu Buhari whom, he said, was poised to address issues of injustice in the South-East. He said ceding the DSP position to him would give South East a sense of belonging, declaring that he already had 56 senators by his side.
