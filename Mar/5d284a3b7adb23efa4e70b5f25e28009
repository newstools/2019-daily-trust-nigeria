Rivers state PDP Campaign Council has said the state governor, Nyesom Wike did not offer N3billion to the governorship candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC), Biokpomabo Awara. Reacting to the press conference held by Awara, the Director of Information and Communications of the state PDP Campaign Council, Emma Okah, denied that Governor Wike offered Awara the sum of N3billion or any sum to drop his governorship ambition. “The allegation is childish and ridiculous. Does he know the weight of N3bn? Where will the governor get such money to give anybody as bribe to win an election that he has already won? “What did Awara do or will do that will make the governor offer him such money? Is it for the lies he tells or the election he contested and failed?” Okah queried. He noted that even though lying is part of the APC, “Awara is running faster than his masters in learning the art of falsehood.” Okah said Awara stands before history to elect between darkness and light and whichever course he chooses will have political implication for the rest of his life. He urged Awara to tow the line of honour mapped by his deputy, Elder Akpo Bomba Yeeh, and free himself from the yoke of standing before history to answer questions which his inordinate ambition has inflicted on the state. “How will Awara explain to God and men of goodwill that he does not care about those that died during the governorship elections; robbing Rivers people their right to choose the governor they like and indeed, the huge economic toll the state has to bear as a result of his recklessness in wanting to serve the wrong master at the wrong time and at all cost?” he said.
