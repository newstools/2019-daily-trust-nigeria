The Peoples Democratic Movement (PDM) has rejected the outcome of the governorship and state House of Assembly elections in Bauchi State over alleged omission of its logo on the ballot papers. The PDM, in a statement in Bauchi, yesterday, signed by its State Secretary, Alhaji Sani Waziri, said the leaders and members of the party considered the omission of its logo by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as “mischievous injustice and absolute violation of the right to vote and be voted for.” According to the statement, PDM is a duly registered political party with INEC, like any other party in the country, and had made all the necessary arrangements to participate in the 2019 general elections. The statement added that PDM had complied with the INEC Timetable and fielded candidates after conducting free and fair primary elections. PDM, however, lamented that its logo was omitted on the National Assembly ballot papers during the presidential and National Assembly elections. It added that its logo was again not placed on the governorship and state House of Assembly elections held on March 9, 2019. The party rejected the results of the governorship and State House of Assembly elections in the state and promised to approach the election tribunal to demand justice for its flag bearers in the elections.
