Over 20,000 security personnel comprising of Police, Army, civil defence and DSS are to cover tomorrow’s gubernatorial and state house of assembly elections in Kano state. The state’s Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Haruna Abdullahi, confirmed this to Daily Trust in a telephone chat on Friday. Abdullahi said one Deputy Inspector General of Police, one Assistant Inspector General of Police and four Commissioners of Police were among the police deployed to monitor the election in Kano. He said the security personnel were deployed to various places especially the flash points across the 44 local government areas of the state. The police spokesperson warned that anybody caught trying to cause trouble would face the wrath of the law, as police would not take it lightly with trouble makers. “Security agents will always be on the alert to ensure that voters respect law and order before, during and after election. “So, I am calling on the public to exercise restrains so that they should not cross the boundaries of law,” he said.
