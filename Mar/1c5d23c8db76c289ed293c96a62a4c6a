The Peoples  Democratic Party (PDP) in the FCT has accused the ruling APC of alleged connivance with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to deploy dysfunctional card readers on election day to frustrate and disenfranchise their supporters. Addressing a press conference at the FCT secretariat of the party in Abuja, yesterday, Secretary of the PDP, Bako  Angulu, alleged that the plot was to target  strongholds of the PDP across the six area councils during the Saturday council polls. He said the party was appreciative of security agencies for exhibiting high sense of professionalism during the presidential and National Assembly elections, and called on them to be wary of desperate moves by the APC to disenfranchise voters on election day. The PDP scribe alleged intimidation and harassment as well as detention of some of the party’s chieftains saying “As we speak some of  our PDP chieftains are being detained at FCT police command and DSS office since last week, which we look at as a move to rig Saturday’s election and disenfranchise our supporters by APC,” he alleged. Reacting, the spokesman of the FCT APC, Adaji Usman, described the PDP allegations as baseless, saying they were an attempt  to win sympathy from the public. He said the ruling APC would triumph across the six area councils in Saturday’s council polls, noting that the achievements of the six council chairmen would be proven on election day.
