Chairman of the Senate Committee on Petroleum (downstream) Kabir Marafa has written to the President of the Court of Appeal Justice Zainab Adamu Bulkachuwa over the delay in the constitution of the appeal panel to entertain the Zamfara All Progressives Congress (APC) primaries tussle. Marafa, in a letter by his counsel, dated 13th March and addressed to Justice Bulkachuwa, said the delay in the constitution of the panel was likely going to deny him justice. The case number CA/32/2019/ Sen Kabiru Garba Marafa & 142 others, was part of the pre-election litigations that trailed the failure of the APC to conduct primaries/ consensus in Zamfara State. The letter reads: “My lord, refer to our letter of concern (copy attached hereto) in which we had respectfully requested that the present panel hearing the above appeal recuses itself for the reasons already humbly adumbrated in the said attached letter dated 4th March 2019 “The appeal came up on the 13th March, 2019 before the Sokoto Division of the court of Appeal. My Lord, to our surprise, the court did not sit but merely sent the court Registrar to inform all counsels and parties concerned that it has recused itself from hearing the appeal; but without any word as to the constitution of another panel to hear the appeal or as to what date the matter will now come up for hearing before a new panel. “This letter is therefore, a SOS to your lordship to kindly and urgently constitute a new panel to hear our client’s appeal. The urgency of this letter and your timeous action are underlined by the very fact that this appeal is constitutionally time-lined and same will expire on the 27th March 2019 constitutional effluxion of time. Where that happens, the appeal itself would lapse and die prematurely due to no fault of the Appellants. “We therefore respectfully appeal to your Lordship to kindly and urgently constitute a new panel to hear our appeal immediately.” A/Court strike out case opposing Zamfara APC from fielding candidates PDP to Appeal Court President: Disband Rivers tribunal AGF’s unfortunate letter to INEC
