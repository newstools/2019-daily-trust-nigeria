The man charged over Friday’s twin mosque attacks in the New Zealand city of Christchurch is believed to have acted alone, police say. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a self-described white supremacist, live-streamed the attack on Facebook. Three others arrested afterwards are not believed to have been involved, Police Commissioner Mike Bush said. Tributes have been paid for the 50 victims while the first bodies are expected to be released for burial. About 34 people are in hospital being treated for injuries including severe gunshot wounds. A four-year-old girl remains in a critical condition. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said her cabinet would discuss issues including gun policy reform on Monday, repeating that there would be “changes to our gun laws”.
