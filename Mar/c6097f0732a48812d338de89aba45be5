The Kano State chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Abdullahi Abbas, has described the forthcoming supplementary election in the state as “do or die contest.” In the short video that went viral yesterday, the party chairman told his supporters that they were ready to provide them maximum protection as they work towards the success of the APC during the supplementary election scheduled to hold on Feb. 23. Surrounded by party supporters at a residential building, Abbas told them not to entertain any fear. “There is every possibility that you can be arrested (by the police),” he enthused. “But let me tell you; before you get to the police station we will make sure you are released and the police that arrested you will likely lose his job,” he said. “We are going to give you every protection that is required. This election is a matter of do or die for us. We must win this election,” Abbas added. The video was probably shot and uploaded by one of the APC loyalists.
