The National Chairman of APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and Africa’s richest man Aliko Dangote have congratulated Governor Jibrilla Bindow of Adamawa State. The duo thumbed up the Adamawa governor for the support he gave in ensuring that President Buhari made a good outing in the North East. In a statement, yesterday, Umar Duhu who is the Secretary of Buhari/Bindow Campaign Council Caucus in Adamawa State, called on well-meaning citizens to disregard mischief makers who insinuated that the PDP overwhelmed the APC in Adamawa State or any other state in the North East. According to Duhu, in spite of “the humongous amount of money spent by Atiku Abubakar of the PDP estimated to be over N4 billion at the just concluded February 23 presidential and National Assembly elections, APC was beaten by just about 31,000 votes in Adamawa compared to the defeat Atiku suffered in Katsina State where the APC candidate, President Muhammadu Buhari comes from. “In Katsina State, Atiku’s PDP was beaten with over 900,000 votes. This display of patriotism and loyalty by Governor Bindow has earned him commendations from notable personalities,” he said. Duhu added: “People have indeed not forgotten history. During the 1979 elections when late Alhaji Ibrahim Waziri contested under the GNPP, the people of the North East supported him to the fullest. “Here we are today, the defunct North East State comprises of six states but Atiku did not win in any of them with any serious margin.” Atiku''s Defection: I am in APC for life – Bindow Why Atiku won Adamawa by a whisker Buhari doesn’t need to campaign in Adamawa – Bindow
