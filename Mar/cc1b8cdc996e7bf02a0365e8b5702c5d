First City Monument Bank (FCMB) Women have trained and empowered some underprivileged widows in the production of various household items. The FCMB Women intervention was in collaboration with Jakin N.G.O, a renowned organisation that works with vulnerable groups in Africa to overcome economic, educational and health challenges. In a statement, FCMB explained that the beneficiaries, 50 widows in all, underwent series of intensive training with Jakin N.G.O in making liquid detergent, air fresheners, insecticides, the use of beads to make various accessories, and headgear tying, among other household items. FCMB’s Divisional Head, Corporate Services, Felicia Obozuwa, said the gesture is in line with the bank’s Corporate Social Responsibility and the commitment of FCMB Women to recognise and support the well-being of the underprivileged in the society. Founder of Jakin NGO, Mrs. Olubukola Adebiyi, expressed gratitude to FCMB Women for their noble role in alleviating the challenges encountered by the underprivileged in the society. A beneficiary, Mrs. Bukky Idowu, who underwent training in soap making, expressed gratitude to FCMB Women and Jakin N.G.O for providing her with the opportunity to acquire the skill. “I had enrolled at various vocational centres to learn how to make soaps, which has been my passion, but none yielded the desired results.” Another beneficiary, Mrs. Caroline Ewurum, said “With the support provided by FCMB Women, I am set to live my dream and become self-reliant as well as an employer of labour soon.’’ FCMB assists widows on small businesses page 22 extra FCMB constructs hostel, water system for the blinds
