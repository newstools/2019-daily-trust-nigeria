The All Progressives Congress (APC) has called for the cancellation of the governorship election results in some parts of Cross River State over alleged disruption of the electoral process. APC National Vice Chairman (South-South), Hilliard Eta and Acting State Chairman, John Ochala, made the call yesterday in Abuja at the party’s National Secretariat. Eta described both governorship and State Assembly elections which held March 9 as ‘sham’. “The National Assembly and governorship/State Assembly elections organized by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Cross River State on Saturday February 23 and Saturday March 9, 2019, respectively, were, at its best, a sham that cannot stand the test of time,” he said. Eta, who said the APC lost to INEC and not Governor Ben Ayade, accused INEC and security agencies of bias. He said the party would use every available legal means to retrieve its mandate and alleged that the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Pastor Usani Uguru Usani, sabotaged the party by working for the re-election bid of the incumbent governor.
