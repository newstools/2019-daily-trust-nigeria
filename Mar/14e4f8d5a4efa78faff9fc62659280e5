Israel’s attorney general intends to indict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on corruption charges. Avichai Mandelblit said Mr Netanyahu would face charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three cases, pending a final hearing. The prime minister is alleged to have accepted gifts from wealthy businessmen and dispensed favours to try to get more positive press coverage. Mr Netanyahu, who is facing an election in April, has denied any wrongdoing. In a televised address, he said the case against him would “collapse like a house of cards”. He repeated his assertion that he is the victim of a left-wing “witch-hunt” intended to topple him ahead of the closely contested election on 9 April. The prime minister will have an opportunity to make his case against the indictments at the final hearing, which is likely to take place after the election. Mr Netanyahu is set to be charged with fraud and breach of trust for accepting expensive gifts – including cigars, pink champagne and jewellery – from Israel-born Hollywood film producer, Arnon Milchan, in return for favours such as help with a US visa and tax breaks.
