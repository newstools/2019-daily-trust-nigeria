The Senior Special Assistant to Imo State Government on Documentation, Dr Austin Uganwa, says “the Eastern Heartland” was adjudged the least corrupt in the country because of the efficient manner through which Governor Emeka Ihedioha has been administering the state governance structure since assumption of duty. Uganwa, who said this yesterday in Abuja, stated that the decisive and audacious steps Governor Ihedioha has taken towards promoting transparency, openness and probity in government business earned the state the award. He cited the introduction of Treasury Single Account (TSA) regime in August through the ratification of Executive Order 005 as one of the major steps. He said another basis for the rating was the revitalization of the Bureau of Public Procurement and Intelligence (BPPI) made moribund by the past administration by the Ihedioha administration. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) working in conjunction with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and other partner international agencies last week graded Imo State with 17.6 percent as the least corrupt state in Nigeria.
