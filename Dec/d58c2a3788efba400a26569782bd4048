The Bayelsa State Governor-elect, Chief David Lyon, has distributed over 5,000 food items and cash gifts to the aged and less privileged persons, including widows, orphans, and person living with disabilities in the state as way of demonstrating love and the spirit of giving among the people. Lyon, who led members of a Non- Governmental Organization (NGO) known as ‘David Lyon Foundation’ to present the items, said the gesture was part of his love for the physically challenged and the aged in the state. The governor-elec, who said he had always told the people of the state that Bayelsa monies belonged to them and not his personal money, reiterated that the donation was aimed at alleviating the suffering of the less privileged. Similarly, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, has celebrated Christmas with the less privileged, urging Nigerians to imbibe the spirit of peace, unity, love and sacrifice. Chief Sylva, who was at his native Okpoama town for the celebration, called on the people to take Christmas as a time  of love as was evidenced in the nativity and the story of Jesus Christ.
