The Conference of Nigeria Political Parties (CNPP) has urged the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr Abubakar Malami, to put all relevant anti-graft institutions in motion to ensure that all aspirants ahead of the 2023 general elections, particularly those who want to take over from President Muhammadu Buhari are “thoroughly” investigated for corruption. The CNPP Secretary General, Chief Willy Ezugwu, yesterday, in a statement, said that would further deepen the war on corruption in the country. The body welcomed the hint by the attorney-general that no fewer than 22 former governors were either on trial or facing investigations over corruption allegations. He said the only way President Buhari administration could consolidate on the new face of the war against corruption was by standing up against corrupt politicians who would want to take over as president or governors in 2023.
