The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has challenged President Muhammadu Buhari to lead by example by publishing details of his spending and financial transactions as an impetus to enforcing his financial reporting directives on Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). The PDP, in a statement yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, also tasked the Presidency to publish details, including the beneficiaries, the purpose and the amount of each payment, in line with the Presidential directive to the MDAs. The party argued that it was not enough for President Buhari to issue spending directives to MDAs, without his Presidency, which received billions of naira in budgetary allocation, leading by example. “Nigerians deserve to know how much is allocated to the Presidency, the various expenditure subheads, process of award of contracts, the contractors, the beneficiaries, amounts paid and payment system. “Perhaps such would explain why certain individuals who are close to the Presidency live in ostentatious opulence and flaunt very expensive lifestyle in the same country where millions of citizens wallow in abject poverty, hunger, homelessness and disease. “It is worrisome that the Buhari Presidency has failed to make details of its yearly budget and expenditure public, despite several demands for openness, which raises anxieties and allegations of huge sleazes and corrupt concealments against certain officials and cabal in the Presidency,” the party said.
