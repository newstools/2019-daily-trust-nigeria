The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has expressed worry over the growing national debt, warning against a full blown debt crisis as President Muhammadu Buhari moves to secure a fresh $30 billion loan. Director-General of the Chamber, Muda Yusuf chronicled that Nigeria’s debt profile grew from N12.6trillion in 2015 to N25.7trillion in 2019 second quarter, an increase of 104 percent. He noted that there is also the bigger worry about the capacity to service the debt. “For instance, the debt service provision in the 2019 budget was a whooping N2trillion; whereas the total capital budget was N2.9 trillion; this implies that the debt service commitment was 70% of capital budget allocation. Debt to revenue ratio was about 30%, which is also on the high side,” “In the 2020 budget, debt service commitment and recurrent spending are beginning to crowd out capital expenditure. This trajectory is not consistent with our national aspiration to build infrastructure and a competitive economy,” he said. Yusuf also said the opportunity cost of high debt service commitment for the economy and citizens is very high; noting that, there is also the exchange rate risk inherent in the exposure to mounting foreign debt, which he said is worrisome. He stressed the need for government to look beyond tax credit in its quest for more complimentary funding sources for infrastructure, while he urged government to look more in the direction of equity financing. “For this to happen, the policy and regulatory environment must be right. It is also critical to review the spending structure of government and the cost of governance. The ballooning recurrent expenditure, in the face of declining revenue is a cause for concern,” Yusuf noted.  $30bn loan: LCCI warns against full blown debt crisis Debt servicing gulps N8trn as FG seeks more loans 2019 budget: Debt service casts doubt on financing infrastructure
