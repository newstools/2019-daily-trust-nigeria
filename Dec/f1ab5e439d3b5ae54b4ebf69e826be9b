An Abuja based organisation, Poverty Alleviation Advocacy and Justice Initiative  (PAAJI), has unveiled a programme aimed at strengthening institutions which provide social services and alleviate poverty. The Executive Director of PAAJI, Barrister Stephen Orukpe, said the organisation’s main purpose is advocating for poverty alleviation, socio-economic justice and strengthening institutions. Orukpe who spoke during the unveiling of the thematic focus of the NGO in Abuja at the weekend, added that majority of Nigerians today are faced with poverty, especially those living in rural areas, stressing that people barely have food to eat and that is  pushing many to commit crimes just to sustain themselves. “With this initiative, we tend to identify such people and proffer lasting solutions to the problem they face. “We have undertaken various reach out services and we believe strongly that it is possible to attain a better society. Today, we intend to show our seriousness by occupying the civic space in having our voices heard and that’s why this event has been modestly packaged,” he added. Also speaking during the event, the Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Poverty Alleviation,  Abdullahi Salami, who was represented by Comrade Muhammad Bawa, said “poverty alleviation cannot be done by the government alone, we need NGOs like PAAJI and others to help reduce the issue of poverty in the society. “The role of NGOs is important to a growing society, though government keeps striving to reduce poverty, NGOs can work together with government to address public issues. “We focus on addressing the poor in the society, therefore, the idea is to teach Nigerians how to fish and not always providing fish for them.” Government intervention for MSMEs sector inadequate - JAAJI NAPEP, poverty and  matters arising FG commits N500bn to poverty alleviation
