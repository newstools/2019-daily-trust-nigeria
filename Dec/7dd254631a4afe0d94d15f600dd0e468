Gunmen suspected to be kidnappers have killed a middle aged man, Usman Dadonyi, and abducted his son, Nasiru Usman at Sukuku village in Kwali Area Council, Abuja. A resident of the community, who preferred anonymity,  said the incident happened last Thursday night when the gunmen numbering about 20 invaded the community shooting sporadically into the air. He said the gunmen went to where the kidnapped victim was charging phones in his shop and asked him to lead them to his father’s room. He said the victim told the gunmen that his father was not at home but when the gunmen threatened to kill him if he failed to lead them to his father’s room, out of fear, he  took them along. “When Dadonyi noticed that the gunmen were coming to his room he tried to escape through another door but one of the gunmen opened fire and shot him,” he said. He said the man died on the spot while they took his son away. A member of the victim’s family, who preferred not to be named, said the family had established contact with the kidnappers and they were demanding  N1 million ransom. “Although, they earlier demanded for N5 million ransom, as the negotiations were on ongoing, the contact person was able to beat it down to N1 million. And how to raise the ransom is what the family is still battling with right now as I speak, “ he said. He said the remains of the deceased middle aged man have been buried according to Islamic rites. The spokesperson of the FCT police command, ASP Mariam Yusuf, did not pick calls or replied to a text message sent to her phone as at the time of filing this report.
