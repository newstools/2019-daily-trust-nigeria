The Executive Secretary, Kaduna Investment Promotion Agency (KADIPA), Hajiya Umma Aboki has said the state government will look into how it can reduce the cost of energy and provide alternative sources of power to ensure that indigenous industries thrive. She noted that if such industries have alternative sources of energy, they will become more efficient which will in turn reduce cost of production. Speaking when she and her team went on a facility tour at El-Jahab Mubarak Nigeria Limited, Hajiya Umma further noted that government will develop a free trade zone in its green allied industrial zone along the Kaduna-Abuja through the African Growth and Opportunity (AGOA) project. She added, “We have had a conversation with the Managing Director of the company around doing a free trade zone because of AGOA project and it is something that we will explore and ensure that we have a free trade zone in our green allied industrial zone along the Kaduna-Abuja road. Managing Director and the Chief Executive Officer of the firm, Alhaji Jafar S.
