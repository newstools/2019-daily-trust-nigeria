The Association of Professional Bodies of Nigeria (APBN) has demanded the inclusion of other professionals in President Muhammadu Buhari’s Economic Advisory Council. The President of Board and Council, APBN, Engr. Olumuyiwa Ajibola while reading the communiqué of the group after its board meeting last Friday, commended Buhari for the economic council. He however noted that the scope should be expanded to accommodate professionals from different sectors of the economy. “It is expected that this would enrich the quality of production of the Team. it is important to note that the Nigerian professionals are willing allies and hereby call on the government to involve them in helping to design the implementation strategies thereof,” APBN said. On infrastructure, the group urged the government to engage local professionals by embedding high local content in the processes, the physical, human and soft infrastructure acquisition to replace foreign-dominated procurement. He said despite the laudable Executive Order 5, most of the government ministries and agencies have not started full implementation to ensure the involvement of local partners in contract execution and supplies. On the various road projects, APBN commended the federal government’s efforts on highways rehabilitations across the country. The members are however concerned that the negative impact of traffic delays are not considered during the implementation of the projects.
