Abuja residents were treated to all genres of music and inspirational performance at a concert tagged S.T.A.G.E 2019. The event which held at the old Parade ground Area 10, Abuja attracted thousands of residents from within the city centre and the satellite towns of Abuja. The initiator of the event, the  head pastor of Summit Bible Church, Abuja, Dr Andy Osakwe, said the essence of the programme is to unmask the creativity in young people and help them harness their talents. “S.T.A.G.E is Showcasing the Artistry of Gods Excellence. It was initiated in 2003 out of the need to discover new expressions and talents through performing arts and provide a platform for youths to showcase their talents and help them grow to achieve those successes. STAGE is not just a show, it is a ministry and through the academy, we provide training and capacity building for the artistes in the area of stage  craft, professional voice and technical training, entertainment/performance management, and ethics and etiquette as it relates to the creative industry,”Osakwe said. Nathan Thomas, Joseph Iditere and Worship Yakubu emerged the finalists of the S.T.A.G.E 2019 talent hunt. A-list Christian artistes such as Tim Geoffrey and The Xtreme Crew, Ada Ehi, Dunsin Oyekan and Sarah thrilled Abuja residents with their music. One of the residents, Mercy Jacob, said the event was awesome. “It is a programme that I feel every person can be inspired by. This is my first time of attending the programme, but I have been inspired by the different artistes, through music, choreography, jokes and the creativity displayed here,” she said. 2018 One Lagos Fiesta to attract 2m participants — Commissioner Naija Sings season 2 returns MUSON music scholars host grand concert in Lagos
