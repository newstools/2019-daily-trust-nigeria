Muslim faithful yesterday besieged the Christ Evangelical and Life Intercessory Ministry in Sabon Tasha, Kaduna to celebrate Christmas with their Christian counterparts in order to strengthen peace and unity.
The General Overseer of the church, Pastor Yohanna Buru expressed delight over the turnout saying such gestures will bring about unity and harmony among adherents of the two faiths.
The cleric said, “The number of Muslims who trooped into the church to attend Christmas services with us is increasing year-by-year as a result of better understanding and religious tolerance.”
He pointed out that the gesture by the Muslims including Islamic schools and religious leaders is clear testimony that Nigerians can be their brothers keeper.
In his sermon, Pastor Buru stressed the importance of promoting peaceful coexistence amongst different faiths in Africa so as to strengthen better understanding in order to live in peace and harmony.
Buru added, “We must remember that we are from one family, because Adam and Eve were our original biological parents; we all have our holy scriptures, the Bible and the Qur’an and we also believed in paradise and hell fire, therefore, we must be our brothers keepers, to live in peace and harmony.
“We are using the Christmas season to unite Muslims and Christians and to promote better understanding among different faith-based organizations.”
Responding on behalf of the Muslim delegate from Katsina State, Malam Murtala Marafa from Funtua said, “We are really happy to be here. We came with Muslims from Kano, Sokoto and Zamfara states to join in celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ with our Christian brothers and sisters.” Over 500 Muslims celebrate Christmas at Pastor’s house in Kaduna Muslims celebrate Xmas at Pastor’s house in Kaduna Christmas: Muslim youths, imams worhip with Christians in Kaduna
