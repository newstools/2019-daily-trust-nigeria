Capital market experts have called on the Federal Government to eliminate multiple tax audits in the country to boost investment. The experts made the call at the sixth Triennial Delegates Conference organised by the Independent Shareholders Association of Nigeria (ISAN) in Lagos last weekend. The Partner, Financial Service Group, Deloitte Tax Function, Mr Taiwo Okunade said government must ensure elimination of multiple tax audits currently discouraging investment. Okunade said federal and state governments agencies must work together to eliminate multiple tax audit and multiple taxation in the country. Speaking on the topic: “The role of taxation in developing the Nigerian capital market,” he said: “There should be harmonisation of audit under the umbrella of the Joint Task Force to conduct a single audit instead of different agencies doing different tax audits.” He revealed that Nigeria was lagging behind in the ease of paying taxes because of multiple taxation and other unfriendly tax laws which discourage investment and tax payment. Okunade also called for the elimination of Value Added Tax (VAT) on commission and fees paid by investors to stockbrokers. Also speaking, the ISAN National Coordinator, Mr Adeniyi Adebisi, urged governments to pursue and implement policies that would enhance national interests rather than selfish interests. He stressed the need for government to relax its hold on projects that required private sector involvement. Adebisi, while delivering a paper on the ‘Capital Market as a Barometer of a Nation’s Economy’, said if the capital market was developed, Nigeria would be opened to the world.
