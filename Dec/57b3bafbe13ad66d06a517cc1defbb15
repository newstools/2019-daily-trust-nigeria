The Lagos State governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, yesterday inaugurated the Physical Planning and Building Control Appeals Committee to interface with members of the public and government in the implementation of the state’s urban planning laws and regulations. The 13-member committee will be mediating and balancing the interest of the citizens and government in disputes that may arise from actions taken in line with the state’s urban development laws. The constitution of the committee, Sanwo-Olu explained, was part of the framework of the Lagos Urban and Regional Planning and Development Laws of 2010, which provided for a public engagement channel for stakeholders and the citizens to channel their complaints to the government. The Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Dr Idris Salako, said he strongly believed the quest for a socially and economically sustainable Lagos could not be achieved without the institution of a platform to settle disputes in the interest of all parties. The committee chairman, Mr. Ayodele Adeniran, described the constitution of the body as a turning point in the implementation of the state’s urban planning laws.
