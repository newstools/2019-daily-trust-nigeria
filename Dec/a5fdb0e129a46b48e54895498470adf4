The Chief Imam and National Missioner of Ansar-Ud-Deen Society of Nigeria (ADS), Sheikh Abdulrahman Olanrewaju Ahmad has called on the Muslim community to intensify their efforts in living a life that reflects the virtues of Prophet Muhammad. He made the call yesterday during the 2019 annual Moulud of the Abuja’s branch themed, “Helping Hands: Virtues of Our Holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W).” Sheikh Abdulrahman, who emphasized the need to help one another, especially the less privileged, said it was not enough for one to identify his or herself as a Muslim, but they must portray and emulate the exemplary life of the holy prophet. He said the program was a call to the entire Muslims to give more to charity. “One of the core messages of Islam is communalism, which is to be our brothers’ keeper, giving alms to the less privilege, among others. I know the Muslim community is already engaged in this but we can actually do better,” he said. The Imam of the Abuja branch of ADS, Dr. Musa Olaofe urged the Muslim community to be proactive in helping the needy in the society.
