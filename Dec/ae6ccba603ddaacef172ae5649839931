Barely a week after 14 persons were remanded in a correctional facility for violating the Lagos State Traffic Laws, another set of 22 offenders have been tried on Monday for same offence. The state Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, had promised to tackle the chaotic traffic situation in the state when he assumed office. To make good his promise, he ordered for the deployment of over 2,000 policemen for traffic duties during peak hours which led to the arrest and arraignment of 22 persons. It was learnt that the 22 offenders were dragged before the state mobile court for allegedly driving against traffic. In addition, the 22 vehicles belonging to the offenders were also confiscated. The state police command commenced the trial in collaboration with Lagos State judiciary and the Attorney General and Commissioner of Justice. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, said the 22 persons were apprehended on Friday, December, 13, 2019 in different parts of Lagos Elkana said that they were nabbed mostly for driving against traffic while their vehicles were confiscated.  “The offenders were immediately arraigned before the mobile court. The enforcement of traffic laws will be sustained all through the festive periods and beyond. The Enforcement team is guided by the mantra ‘Traffic must flow,’” he said. It could be recalled that the Lagos police commissioner upon assumption of office declared a state of emergency in traffic. The CP with the support of Lagos State Government also deployed 200 motorcycles for traffic control and patrol to ensure free flow of traffic and also combat traffic related crimes such as robbery.
