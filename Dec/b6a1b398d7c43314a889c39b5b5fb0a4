Ogun State House of Assembly on Friday passed N449.97billion 2020 budget presented to the house by Governor Dapo Abiodun earlier this month. The assembly, however, passed the Appropriation Bill with an adjustment to the capital expenditure, which led to an increment of N2.1bn for capital projects. With the increment, the capital estimate now stands at N271,232,349,884.46 as against N269,132,349,884.46 proposed by the governor. The passage of the bill titled: “HB. No. 032/OG/2019- Year 2020 Appropriation Law”, followed presentation and consideration of the report of the House Committee on Finance and Appropriation by Hon. Olakunle Sobukanla. The report showed that there was also a review in the recurrent expenses of six agencies, capital estimates of nineteen others and the revenue targets of seven agencies, while the recurrent expenditure was slashed from N154.896bn to N152.796bn, representing a reduction of N2.1bn in the recurrent expenditure. Besides, the capital expenditure was moved from N269.132bn to N271.232bn, representing an increment of N2.1bn. Having considered the bill clause-by-clause during the plenary presided over by the Speaker, Olakunle Oluomo, the Majority Leader, Yusuf Sheriff, moved the motion for the third reading and final passage of the bill and seconded by the Minority Leader, Ganiyu Oyedeji. Oluomo, therefore, directed the Acting Clerk of the house, Deji Adeyemo to prepare a neat copy of the bill for the governor’s assent. The Speaker applauded his colleagues “for their dedication and support which led to the timely passage of the bill.” He said “the prompt passage of the Appropriation Bill was a Christmas cum new year gift for the people of the State.” Ogun Assembly passes  budget bill Kaduna Assembly passes 2019 budget Benue Assembly passes 2019 budget
