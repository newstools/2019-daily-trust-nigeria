The Cross River State Independent Electoral Commission (CROSIEC) has shifted local government election from February 22 to March 28, 2020. CROSIEC Director General Dr Mike Ushie confirmed this in a statement made available to journalists in Calabar. He said the decision was taken after wide consultation with stakeholders in the electoral process across the state. While regretting any inconvenience the postponement might have caused, he said the action was considered in line with the provisions of CROSIEC Law, 2004, and the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended).
