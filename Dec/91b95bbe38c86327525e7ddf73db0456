Barely two days after gunmen suspected to be kidnappers abducted the traditional ruler of Rubochi, Alhaji Mohammed Ibrahim Pada, the gunmen have again abducted a man, Jarus Iliya and his younger sister, Mercy Iliya at the neighbouringTika village of Kuje Area Council in the FCT. A member of the victim’s family, who confirmed the abduction to our reporter in the village on Sunday, said the incident happened around 12:46am last Friday in the area. He said the gunmen who came wielding sophisticated weapons invaded the community and went straight to the house of the victim to pick him up alongside the younger sister at gunpoint. He said the gunmen shot severally into the air to scare residents of the community before they whisked away the victims into the bush. According to him, the family has been able to establish contact with the kidnappers, adding that the kidnappers were demanding for N10million ransom before the victims will be set free. “Although negotiation is still ongoing because the last time they called, they are saying the family should bring N5 million while the family is pleading with them to accept N500,000 after which they suddenly switched off their phones,” he said.
