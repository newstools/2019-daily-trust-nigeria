Inter Party Women Network (IPWN), Kaduna State chapter, has called on political parties to create avenues for women in politics to have access into elective positions rather than appointment. The call was made in Kaduna after a one-day synergy meeting between media practitioners and women in politics organised by Legal Awareness for Nigerian Women (LAWN) in collaboration with National Democratic Institute (NDI). A member of the group, Hon. Aisha Mohammed, who lauded Kaduna State government for appointing women into key positions in the cabinet, called on political parties to create gender sensitive bills that would allow women stand for elective positions into political party offices. Mohammed, who advocated that the position of women leaders be scraped to allow women vie for key positions in political parties, said it would enable them venture into more tasking roles in politics rather than limiting their chances to being women heads. LAWN Coordinator Hannatu Ahuwan identified fear and societal perception of women as home keepers as the factors hindering them from competing with men, stressing the need for journalists to use their platforms to create awareness and encourage more women to participate in politics.
