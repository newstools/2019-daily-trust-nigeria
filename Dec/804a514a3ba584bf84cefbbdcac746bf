Scores of women in Ogun state yesterday stormed the State House of Assembly complex, rejecting the 18 – man Commissioner-nominees of Governor Dapo Abiodun. This comes just as the legislature began screening of the nominees for possible confirmation as requested by Governor Abiodun. The women groups numbering about 25 equally laid siege at the entrance of the governor’s office, saying the nominees’ list fell short of the  35 per cent representation in the cabinet. Speaking on behalf of the Coalition of Women in Ogun state, the convener, Dr Abiola Akiyode said the women rejected the commissioner-nominees list submitted by the governor on the ground that there was only 11.5 per cent women representation. Akiyode argued that the governor had refused to fulfill his promise of 50 per cent women representation in his cabinet. She described the list as an affront to women in the state, adding that the women of the state are angry with the governor. The Speaker of State House of Assembly, Olakunle Oluomo, who addressed the protesters,  said the legislature would look into the demands of the women and ensure that proper actions were taken.
