The member representing Ado/Okpokwu/Ogbadigbo Federal Constituency of Benue State, Francis Ottah Agbo, has said that despite the contributions to the nation’s economy, his constituency is the most neglected in the whole country. Agbo, who is the spokesperson of the Minority Caucus, said this when he received a delegation of his constituents from Ijigban/Ulayi/Ekile Communities of Ado Local Government Area led by Emmanuel Ogaba. He said his constituents contributed a lot to the economy of Benue State and the nation, especially through agriculture but remained the most neglected set of people in terms of infrastructure and employment into the state and federal civil service. He said the constituency had been “grossly underdeveloped”, thereby turning his people to “a laughing stock in Nigeria”. Agbo pleaded with the federal government to address the neglect of Ado, Okpokwu, Ogbadibo Federal Constituency in the area of infrastructure and federal appointments. The lawmaker informed the delegation of his decision to donate his four-year salary to the poorest of the poor like widows and orphans to help ameliorate their plight. He told the delegation  that he had lobbied for the inclusion of some projects in the 2020 budget and expressed hope that the government of President Muhammadu Buhari would release adequate funding to execute the projects in his constituency. Speaking earlier, the leader of the delegation commended the lawmaker for his good representation at the green chamber. He encouraged him to lobby for mass employment of his constituents in the state and federal civil service as well as paramilitary agencies.
