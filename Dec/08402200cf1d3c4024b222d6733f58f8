The governorship candidate of Alliance for Democracy (AD) in the 2019 Lagos State gubernatorial election, Chief Owolabi Salis, has described the decisions of the governorship election petitions tribunal and Court of Appeal dismissing his petition against Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s election as “corruption of justice.” He has therefore approached the Supreme Court seeking the nullification of the victory of Sanwo-Olu in the March 9, 2019 governorship election, insisting the governor was not elected by majority of lawful votes. The election petition tribunal had dismissed Salis’ petition for lacking in merit while his appeal filed at the appellate court was also resolved against him. Dissatisfied by both verdicts, the AD candidate approached the Supreme Court in suit number SC:1421/2019 seeking nullification of Sanwo-Olu’s election on various grounds. He said the election was marred by many irregularities, vote buying and politicking, adding that the result was doctored to reflect zero votes for AD in Ifako Ijaiye Local Government in Lagos. He said the governor was not elected by majority of valid votes even as he claimed that the voter’s card used by the governor was “cloned.” Salis said he discovered this when he called for Sanwo-Olu’s forms at INEC and the fact was proven and documented. The AD candidate said, “It is laughable that our so acclaimed law abiding governor elect will use a clone card to vote during election, this and so many other irregularities that we discovered has proved that Babajide Sanwo-Olu is not only fake he does not deserve the seat he is currently occupying.” AD heads to Supreme Court, seeks nullification of Sanwo-Olu's election Lagos guber poll: AD, Labour Party challenge Sanwo-Olu's victory, head to tribunal Appeal Court upholds Sanwo-Olu’s election
