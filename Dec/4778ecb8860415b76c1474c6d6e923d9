Nigerians, especially Christians, have been enjoined to display love to neighbours, family, friends and the needy in society in commemoration of the birth of Jesus Christ which heralded salvation for mankind. In a goodwill message yesterday, Globacom, reminded Christians of the real essence of Christmas, a season of sharing and caring as exemplified by the teaching of Jesus Christ. “As we celebrate Christmas, let us prepare for  the second coming of Christ  in our acts and deeds and in caring for our loved ones and  neighbours. We should always remember that the advent of Christ is near,” the company stressed. “We, therefore, call on all Nigerians to allow the celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ to engender progress and amity in the society through good neighbourliness, selflessness and unity”, Globacom said.
