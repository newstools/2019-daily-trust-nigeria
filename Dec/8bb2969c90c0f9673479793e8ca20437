A Catholic Priest, Rev. Fr. Francis Odigbo, on Sunday warned children who abused and beat up their parents at old age to desist and ask for forgiveness to prevent being battered by their own children later in life. Odigbo also called on parents to inculcate strong family values especially love and peaceful co -existence in children to instill good citizenship in them for the improvement of the society. This was during a sermon held to mark the  Feast of the Holy Family of Jesus, Mary and Joseph at  Christ the King Catholic Church, Kurudu, Abuja on Sunday, where he is also the Parish Priest.He described the family as a special place where values were being learnt and that if the children picked good morals and values at home, the society would be a peaceful place to live. “If parents show love to their children, they teach them how to love other people even in the wider society, the children will only pick what they see you doing and that’s what they take outside to other children too.” Odigbo attributes the rise in all manners of crime and insurgency to the loss of family values and called on all to change the narrative for the better. He said strong family values such as kindness, love, respect for one another, honesty were very important for the society to thrive well. “Couples should find time to bond and share quality time with themselves and with their children, thereby inculcating these virtues in their children will only do what they see parents doing.” (NAN) He also advised the children to show  respect and become pillars for their parents in their old age as the attributes come with immeasurable blessings as they grow to become parents.
