Mr Samson Aliyu of Peculiar Disciples of Christ Ministry, Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church, has urged Christians and  others to embrace peace during the Christmas and New Year season and beyond. Aliyu, a pastor, who made the call at the 2019 Christmas carol of Nine Lessons at Dakibiyu District, Kubwa, Abuja, on Sunday, said Jesus Christ was born to bring peace to the world and to those who believe in him. He emphasised the need for Christians to run to Jesus Christ whenever in need and to create time to fellowship with him. “We are celebrating Christmas because an unusual person has stepped into the world; it is beneficial for Christians to make Jesus their best friend because he gives inner peace to men which other friends cannot give,” Aliyu said. He further advised Christians to imbibe the culture of praying for peace for oneself and the society. “By redemption as a Christian, you are light, search for light because when light comes, darkness gives way. “It is the potency of the light you carry as a Christian that determines your speed in life,” Aliyu added. Oluwatosin Ademola,, an evangelist of Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church, urged Christians to live like Christ in their places of work and businesses. Ademola added that it was the light of Christ in them that would distinguish them from other individuals. While advising Christians to embrace Jesus at all times, Ademola urged them to be good ambassadors of Christ in all their endeavours. “This is the season of love, let us remember the poor and less privileged people among us. “Let us share what we have no matter how little,” he said.
