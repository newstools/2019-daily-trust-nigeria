The President of Relate International Prayer Forum for Nations, Barr Ebuk Ekpo, has urged Nigerians to pray for leaders to succeed and not just criticise them. Ekpo said this during the end of year prayer meeting by the forum which was held on Friday in Abuja, stressing that there was need to pray for Nigeria and its leaders at different levels. “We are here to pray for disturbed nations and today we are praying for Nigeria. We want to pray for the First Lady of this nation and wives of governors and ministers because they are the mothers of this nation and Esthers of our time. “When the first lady says all is not well, we do not see anybody praying for her. They need our prayer as leaders because when things are bad and there is a problem, you talk to the wives/mothers and they talk to their husbands,” Ekpo said. She added that as people criticise the leaders, they should also give solutions to the problems, stating that the nation will survive and people will stay in peace and love. Leading the prayers, Pastor Michael Olufemi of Redeemed Christian Church of God, FCT, Province 10, Karu said the significance of the prayer meeting was to return Nigeria to God. “We pray for mercy and we are reconnecting Nigeria back to God,” he said.
