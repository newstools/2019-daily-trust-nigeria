The Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) has raised an alarm over suspected plans by cyber fraudsters to attack telecommunication networks to perpetrate financial fraud. Executive Commissioner of the commission’s Stakeholders Management, Mr Adeleke Adewolu, disclosed this in Abuja at the 4th Quarter 2019 Industry Consumer Advisory Forum (ICAF) meeting. He said Nigeria has lost “whopping sums of money” to cyber fraud, noting that the telecom sector was not immune from “the scourge of cyber fraudsters across the country. Attackers are now targeting telecom networks with the intent to disrupt service delivery and infiltrate their data banks.” Adewolu explained that “Illegal SIM Swaps and Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) e-payment frauds are currently some of the most serious cyber threats in the telecom industry. “Fraudsters conduct illegal SIM swaps of targeted individuals and then, conduct USSD-based transactions which cost the unlucky victims huge losses. “This malevolent use of modem technologies is taking its toll on the Nigerian telecoms industry, with some subscribers reportedly having lost huge sums of money to telecom related financial crimes since the emergence and use of smartphone technology in the country,” he noted. The NCC official, however, told the gathering that the commission was working in collaboration with telecoms operators, banks, security agencies and other stakeholders to tackle the menace of financial fraud headlong.
