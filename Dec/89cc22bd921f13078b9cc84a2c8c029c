The FCT sector commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) ACC Ayuba Wobin Gora, has said about 1,600 men and officers of the corps will be deployed on the highways ahead of the Christmas and new year celebration. Gora, who made this known during an interview with our reporter in Abuja yesterday, said  special marshals will be deployed at four exit points of  Nyanya, Dutsen Alhaji, Zuba and Gwagwalada-Lokoja highways. He said the four entry and exits points were the major places that people come into Abuja and go out, saying the officers will focus more on traffic control as motorists convey travellers to their destinations for celebration of Christmas and new year. He said the corps will be strict with deviant motorists who disobey traffic rules and regulations, saying the major concern of the corps is to ensure free movement of vehicles without any hitch. “But owners must ensure that their vehicles are road worthy, well maintained and they can do the journey they want to embark on,” he said. He also said the corps will deploy ambulances at all strategic spots across the four exit points in case of accident, saying the ambulances can easily get to the crash scene to rescue any accident victim to the hospital. Gora added that the corps will also meet with leaders of heavy duty trucks to discuss with them on how they should avoid indiscriminate parking, which he said causes obstructions on the highways. He therefore warned motorists against overloading, over speeding, dangerous driving while plying the highways, saying mobile courts will be at strategic places to prosecute drivers that violate traffic rules and regulations.
