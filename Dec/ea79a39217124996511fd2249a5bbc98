He said it was important for not only the children but also adults to devote their time to acquire Islamic religious knowledge, which he said will enhance the sustenance of peace in the society. “And again, I want to call on all our Muslim clerics and Imams here to devote their time in also praying for peace of the country, as we all know the security challenge surrounding us as a nation is daunting, ” he said. The council chairman further called on parents to send their male children to attend Islamiyya school, saying it was quite worrisome that majority of the graduands were mostly females. He therefore urged the graduands to continue to be obedient to their parents, and also spare their time in reciting the Holy Qur’an at all times so that the younger ones will learn from them. The chairman later presented prizes to some of the graduands.  ‘Encourage your children to acquire Islamic knowledge’ Madarasatul Islamiyya graduates 11 in Abaji Centre for Islamic Excellence graduates 95 in Abaji
