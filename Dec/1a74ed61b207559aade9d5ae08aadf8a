A 55-year-old man, Uchenna Paul Uneli, was yesterday charged before the Ogudu chief magistrate court in Lagos with allegedly obtaining the sum of N1.485 million under false pretence. The police said Uneli committed the offence between October and November 2017 at Kosofe, Mile 12, Lagos. It was alleged that the accused person obtained the money from Eze Okpara on the pretence he would supply him copper wire, brass, stainless steel and zinc. The police further alleged that the accused person then converted the money to his own use. Uneli, however, pleaded not guilty.  The court admitted him to bail in the sum of N500,000 and fixed trial for January 14, 2020. 55-year-old surety faces trial over suspect’s escape Building contractor allegedly swindles client of N4.8m N2.5m fraud case against fake Customs officer continues Aug 19
