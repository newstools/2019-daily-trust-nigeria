The FCT ministerial task team on traffic free flow has given the Abuja Market Management Limited  a directive to immediately address the traffic situation in and around  the Wuse market. In a letter which was signed by the chairman,  Ikharo Attah, the traffic team said, “ we have noted with dismay the continuous traffic gridlock around the Wuse market as vehicles enter the market”. Attah added that, “ Having studied the situation  at Wuse market for over two months , we have come to a conclusion that the problem lies within the market itself. A situation where vehicles are pouring into the market in geometric proportions and  exiting in arithmetic proportions,  shows that something is significantly not adding up. Every market or shopping centre where vehicular movement does not show a balance in entry and exit always experience chaotic traffic gridlock in roads around them”. The traffic task team chairman pointed out that, “ the FCT administration haven addressed the traffic problems at Nyanya, Dutse Alhaji, and  Kubwa Expressway would not ignore the disturbing traffic problem around Wuse market which is located in the heart of the city.” Attah told the market managers to, immediately take urgent and bold steps to address the problem which has made it difficult to traverse roads around the market.  The task team chairman pointed out that the FCT minister, Mallam Muhammad  Musa Bello, haven been briefed  on the issues, has shown total commitment to addressing the problem. The traffic task team chairman concluded by warning that if the traffic problem is not immediately solved by the market managers, its members, “ would move in and take very drastic steps that would restore traffic sanity in and around the market”.
