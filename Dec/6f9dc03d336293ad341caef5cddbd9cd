A brand management consultant, Pwano Maxwell, has called on the federal government to implement the indigenous policy in business. Maxwell who disclosed this in Lagos recently, said it is important for the federal government to, as a matter of urgency, enact laws that will enhance the growth of local brands. According to him, the indigenisation policy was intended to bolster the economic and political autonomy of post-colonial Nigeria, but as with several other government agendas and with the passage of time, numerous unforeseen obstacles have cropped up, proving that the indigenisation policy may be easier said than done. He further stressed that, “several cunning foreigners who were about being dispossessed of their businesses devised a clever strategy that would enable them to appear to have relinquished control, but in reality, they would still manage their businesses through the agency of their indigenous associates.” “Indigenous brands invest in the country’s economy, and the foreign brands do not. If they say they do, let them show us round their factories and present their workforce for interview about their welfare.” Reacting to the battle of carbonated soft drink brands in Nigeria, which from all indications had simmered down, a number of pertinent issues still deserve mention and insightful analysis in a healthy public discourse by the people and their leaders, he said. They must speak up against any attempt to frustrate the growth of indigenous brands, he said. While responding to questions on how unhealthy competition affects local brands, he pointed out that, when the focus is only on competition, quality gets undermined.
