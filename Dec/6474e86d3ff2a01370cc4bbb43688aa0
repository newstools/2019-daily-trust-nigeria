Speaking on the efforts being made to upgrade facilities following the recent electrical incident in Ikoyi MSCC, Lagos, where five inmates lost their lives, he said “a reassessment of utility services in our facilities nation-wide is currently ongoing in order to device possible ways of coping with the phenomenal overcrowding in the system and avoid recurrence. Enobore added that Corrections Information Management System (CIMS) had been developed to capture inmates’ biometrics. “This CIMS will assist the Service to Identify Inmates and aid their case management. The project has taken off already in 80 locations across the country,” he added.
