The mother of a former governor of Ondo State, Alhaja Muyinat Mimiko, is dead. She was  88. In his sympathy message to Mimiko, the incumbent governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu, said he received the news of the death of Alhaja Mimiko with “a deep sense of loss.” In a statement signed by the Ondo State Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mr Donald Ojogo, Akeredolu said, “I consider the demise of the mother of my school mate, friend of decades and immediate predecessor in office as a personal loss. “Undoubtedly, her exit has created an irreplaceable vacuum in the family and her immediate environment. Nonetheless, our collective sense of fulfilment lies in the comfort of Mama’s hard work, high moral standard and discipline. “The government of Ondo State is particularly enthralled by the exploits of one of her sons, Olusegun, the former governor whose shrewd intervention in the critical health sector is now a reference point.”
