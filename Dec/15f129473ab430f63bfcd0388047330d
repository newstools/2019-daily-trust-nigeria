The Governor of Rivers State,  Nyesom Wike, says since it is beyond his power, he cannot promise that a particular ethnic nationality will take over from him. Wike, who spoke yesterday during a solidarity visit by the Ogoni Ethnic Nationality at Government House, Port Harcourt, said only God has the capacity to make any ethnic nationality Governor of Rivers State. “Let nobody say that I have met with Ogoni Ethnic Nationality and I promised them Governor.  I didn’t promise because I cannot give. “It is only God that will give the position of Governor.  With proper arrangement, things can be done. Don’t say I made a promise, don’t rely on anyone, just work hard. As Nyesom Wike, I can only support, but cannot make anyone Governor,” he said. He urged the people of Ogoni to work together in order to achieve set goals and build bridges across various ethnic nationalities to succeed politically. The governor, who thanked the Ogoni people for supporting him to win the election, advised those planning to run for governorship election in the state among them to be fully prepared to struggle for the position. Speaking during the solidarity visit,   Gbenemene Tai and Chairman, Supreme Council of Ogoni Council of Traditional Rulers, King G.N.K. Giniwa, lauded the governor for his support to the Ogonis and pledged their support to the administration.
