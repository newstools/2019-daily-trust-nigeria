Christmas was celebrated amidst tight security in Kano,  with heavy police deployment at worship centres and recreational facilities within the state capital and its surrounding environment inhabited by Christian communities. Our reporter observed that the security presence had encouraged massive turnout at churches by Christian faithful of different denominations as they commemorate the birthday anniversary of Jesus Christ. Some of the Christian leaders who spoke to our reporter lauded the security measures taken by the government during the festive period, commending it for its efforts at sustaining peaceful coexistence, as well as entrenching spirit of tolerance among the adherents of the two major religious groups in the state. The resident pastor, the Apostolic Church Kadawa, P. O. Ajayi lauded the spirit of tolerance and accommodation accorded the Christian minority to practice their faith in the state, appealing to all and sundry to show love to one another based on teachings of Jesus Christ. “First of all we are very grateful to God for the grace given to us to witness today that we celebrate the birth of our lord Jesus Christ the savior that surrendered his life and died on the cross for our sins. Secondly we thank God for living in this environment particularly Kadawa village, we thank God for the understanding that God has given our Muslim neighbours to allow us to practice our faith. “Since I came here we have never had any issues with our brothers from the other religion, it has always been love, peace and mutual respect for each others’ religion. We celebrate together at the time of joy and mourn together at moments of grief. During Christmas they celebrate with us and during Sallah we celebrate with them as well and it has always been love and tolerance” he said.
