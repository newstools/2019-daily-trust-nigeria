The Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Board Chairman of Nexim Bank, Okwu Joseph Nnanna, has commended Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State for his “industrialization drive,” and encouraged him to approach them for more funds to boost his dream. He said they have financed similar industrial projects which the governor has set up at the federal level, adding that the bank would back them since they would not only provide jobs but also boost economic outputs. He spoke in Calabar when he paid a visit to the state governor over the weekend during which he inspected the Ayade Industrial Park. The CBN boss expressed excitement over the industrial park project, noting that the factories would boost job creation and economic empowerment. Okwu lauded the governor for establishing the industries, saying “this is job creation, economic empowerment for men and women, youths and the vulnerable. It is fantastic and there is nowhere to be compared.” On his part, the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of the bank, Abba Bello, revealed that his bank already has a Memorandum of Understanding with the state and as such, is willing to partner with it.
