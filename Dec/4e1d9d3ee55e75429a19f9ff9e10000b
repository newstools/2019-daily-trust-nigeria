Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) has called on the Niger State Independent Electoral Commission (NSIEC) to douse the tension that trailed the conduct of the local government election in Tafa Council by announcing the contentious result. Daily Trust reports that protest had trailed the decision of SIEC to cancel the result for Tafa Local Government Area in last Saturday’s poll following the alleged disappearance of the returning officer for the area. However, IPAC at the end of its meeting to review the conduct of the election yesterday in Minna, said the commission should have gone ahead to announce the outcome since collation was done at the ward level. “IPAC as an umbrella body of all registered political parties in the state and major stakeholder in politics is jealously guided by the interest of political parties but believe that the peaceful coexistence of the people of Niger State is equally paramount. “In this vein, our attention has been drawn to Tafa local government which is the only contentious area. As partners in progress, we resolved to advice the commission that, hence collation of results and returns were made at the ward levels and the only reason given by the commission was the disappearance of the Returning Officer, we urge for the completion of the process and whoever emerges victorious should be declared winner irrespective of political parties,” it observed through the statement signed by its secretary, Mohammed Bello Maikujeri. It said its position is in line with the desire and wish of the two contending political parties, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Congress (APC).
