The Minister of Power, Engr. Sale Mamman, says he is inspecting power projects nationwide to be acquainted with them and verify issues before making promises. He was speaking during a facility tour to MEMMCOL, an indigenous meter manufacturer in Lagos at the weekend, to ascertain the capacity of company to meet their 30 percent quota of metering Nigerians. After the inspection, Mamman said he could speak on solutions only when he was sure of the facts so that people would have confidence in the system. The minister noted that the major problem traumatising electricity consumers in the country was the problem of meters and the attendant issues of estimated billings. He vowed to ensure that Nigerians are adequately provided with meters to justify their payment instead of billing them above their actual consumption. He said the provision of meters would also resolve the issue of the claim by Distribution Companies (DisCos) that consumers are not paying their bills, a statement by his spokesman, Aaron Artimas said. Engr. Mamman who expressed satisfaction with MEMMCOL’s meter production capacity assured that the Ministry of Power will support every endeavour to massively provide meters to Nigerians. The chairman of MEMMCOL, Engr. Kola Balogun, told the minister that the company produced about 1,000 meters daily with capacity to exceed with more support and patronage. Balogun said the company also produced other electrical equipment like digitized transformers and tracking systems.
