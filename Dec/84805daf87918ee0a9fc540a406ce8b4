Chairman of Board of Directors of Brass LNG Limited, Mr. Jackson Gaius-Obaseki, has commended the government of President Muhammadu Buhari for the commitment and support towards the take-off of the Brass Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project. In a chat with journalists after the 13th Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Brass LNG Limited in Abuja, Mr.Gaius-Obaseki said both the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources Chief Timipre Sylva and the Group Managing Director of the NNPC Mallam Mele Kyari have shown enormous enthusiasm to work with shareholders of the company in realising the early delivery and realisation of the Brass LNG project. “Something you can’t take away from this government is that they don’t abandon projects. Even projects they met, they have picked all up, completed and improved on it. It is just for shareholders to say we want to do and it will be done,” he said. Originally set up in 2003, the Brass LNG is a multi-billion dollar liquefied natural gas project located in Brass, Bayelsa State with NNPC as its major shareholder (59.08%), Total (20.46%) and ENI (20.46%). The gas project has been stuck in the early works  stages for more than a decade due to a number of challenges. Gaius-Obaseki said the shareholders have kept the project long for years and it was time to either restart it or look for alternative.
