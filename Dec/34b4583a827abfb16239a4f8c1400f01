The Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) has said the recently released 2017 audit report by the Auditor-General of the Federation, Anthony Ayine, is characterized by some irregularities. The 591-page “Annual Report of the Auditor-General for the Federation on the Account of the Federation of Nigeria for the Year Ended 31st December, 2017” has generated diverse reactions. Onyekpere while presenting a report titled “Highlight of Infractions in the 2017 Audit Report” by the centre said there is an omission of over N22bn in the federation account transcript statement. He urged the Accountant-General to reconcile the sum of N22,259,485,631.84 that did not reflect in the transcript for the month of April 2017. He said, “Examination of Federation Account transcript statement revealed that revenue collected for the month of March, 2017 amounting to N22,259,485,631.84 being excess proceeds on PPT from oil did not reflect in the transcript for the period. “The Accountant-General is required to reconcile the sum of N22,259,485,631.84 not reflected in the transcript for the month of April 2017”, the report partly read. He also faulted that report of the AuGF in 2017 dated July 22, 2019, which is coming 19 months after the end of the financial year and one month short of meeting the 18 months international standard. Onyekpere said that the report is a litany of woes evidencing “the poor management and unaccountability of the federal fiscal system and should be corrected”. He also urged the Accountant-General to revisit the calculations of Capital Grant and Reserves to make appropriate corrections.
