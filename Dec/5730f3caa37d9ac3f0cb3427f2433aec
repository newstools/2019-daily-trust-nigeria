The Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Ndudi Elumelu, (PDP, Delta) says the opposition caucus will monitor the implementation of the 2020 budget by stepping up its oversight activities. Elumelu, in a statement issued yesterday in Abuja, said that the minority leadership had already worked out an end-to-end monitoring strategy that would ensure effective implementation, check corruption and diversions and plug waste. The minority leader reiterated that Nigerians had placed confidence in the opposition for solution and as such opposition lawmakers had braced up to leave no stone unturned in ensuring that budgetary provisions, especially those that have direct bearing on the wellbeing of the masses were fully implemented. He directed all opposition lawmakers to insist on intensified budget oversight in their respective committees to guarantee transparency and strict compliance to expenditure items, figures and location, as passed. He also called on all lawmakers to ensure effective and timely implementation of constituency projects in line with their commitment to the people. He tasked ministries and agencies to exert its implementation capacity to ensure that all funds released to them were fully utilized and accounted for. Elumelu also cautioned ministries, departments and agencies, particularly revenue-generating agencies to bear in mind that Nigerians were already economically stressed and as such should develop more efficacious wealth-creating strategies that did not place more burden on the citizens. The minority leader assured that the opposition would not relent in protecting the interest of the people while “constructively” disallowing any programme and policy that were inimical to the health of the nation.
