The Federal Government has inaugurated the Nigeria Immigration Service Forward Operation Base in Daura, Katisna and Adamawa State command complexes Jimeta, Yola. The Service Public Relations Officer, Mr Sunday James, disclosed this in a statement on Monday in Abuja. The projects, commissioned by the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, was funded by the Federal Government. Aregbesola admonished the officers and men of the command to be dutiful and professional in their approach to National assignment as it relates to their core mandates. He emphasised the need for officers and men in Adamawa and Katsina states to be security conscious at all times. “Being security conscious would enhance economic prosperity of Nigeria by ensuring that only genuine, regular migrants are allowed into the country,” he said. Aregbesola, however, tasked both commands to maintain a green environment by planting trees to make it more conducive and refreshing. The Comptroller-General, NIS, Muhammad Babandede, reiterated that visa on arrival at the point of entry was not going to compromise national security against the opinion of many who misunderstood the good intentions of government. Babandede tasked the officers and men of the service to justify the support and commitment of government to the service to improve conditions of working environment and livelihood of the officers.
