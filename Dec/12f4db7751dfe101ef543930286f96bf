Governor Aminu Masari of Katsina State says the dissolution of the State Muslim Pilgrims Board and the sacking of its Executive Secretary are based on reports that revealed several underhand dealings and racketeering in collusion with service providers in the holy land, especially on accommodation, feeding and transportation. Speaking when he received the 2019 Hajj report, Masari said it was disheartening for people saddled with responsibility to be involved in such unwanted acts, adding that the government has set in motion moves to reorganise the board to come to terms with modernity. He gave a picture of the situation saying, “people who didn’t pay through our board are later loaded unto us to accommodate and this has been consistent. International pilgrims will displace our people and we as government are later made to pay for additional expenses.” Earlier, in his remarks, the leader of the state delegation, Muntari Lawal, told the governor that for years, officials have been lying to government on securing accommodation close to the Haram, saying “it is all lies and this year was worse as places gotten were infested with rodents and lacked basic facilities.
