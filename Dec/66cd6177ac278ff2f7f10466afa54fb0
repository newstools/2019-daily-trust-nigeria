The Edo State House of Assembly has removed the suspended chairman of Esan West local government area, Patrick Aguinede, over unremitted internally generated revenues (IGR). Aguinede was removed yesterday, following the consideration of the report of the panel of enquiry set up by Governor Godwin Obaseki to investigate allegations of fraud levelled against him. The panel report which considered by the house stated the chairman did not only present fake figures to it but also found him wanting for under-remitting the IGR of the LGA into the state government coffers. According to the panel, Aguinede was remitting N4.5 million while within the period he was suspended, the council remitted N7.6 million. According to the report, the Acting Chairman of the council, between October 7 and 30 October remitted N9.1 million IGR to the state government. The report said the difference in the amount generated in the LGA  revealed that Aguinede was under remitting the council’s IGR and recommended that the chairman be removed from office having been found culpable of the allegations. The house, however, adopted the panel’s recommendation by removing the chairman from office. The speaker, Francis Okiye, directed that copies of the resolution be sent to Governor Obaseki.
