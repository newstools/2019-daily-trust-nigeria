The Lagos State police command yesterday docked a 35-year-old man, Shakiru Mumuni, before an Ikeja magistrate court for allegedly abducting his ex-lover, Mariam Abifari.
The police prosecutor, Assistant Superintendent of Police N. Peter, told the court that Mumuni allegedly abducted Abifari on November 5, 2019, at about 2pm, at Olabua, Orile Agege, because the woman decided to end her relationship with him. Mumuni pleaded not guilty to the two-count criminal charge levelled against him.
Chief Magistrate Y. O. Aje-Afunwa admitted him to bail of N250,000, with a surety whose tax status should be verified.
Aje-Afunwa also adjourned the case till February 4, 2020 for further hearing. Police arraign man over N10.5m fraud Man arraigned for stealing N9.150m Police arraign man over N2.3m diesel theft
