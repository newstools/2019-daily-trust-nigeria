The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has said that it received the news of the death of the senator representing Imo North Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Benjamin Uwajumogu, with “great shock and sadness”. National Publicity Secretary of the party, Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, in a statement issued yesterday in Abuja, said many who crossed paths with the late senator described him as pleasant and accommodating. Issa-Onilu said the deceased was an astute politician, fine lawmaker, social crusader, successful businessman, humanitarian and a philanthropist. “As a former speaker of Imo State House of Assembly, the late Senator Uwajumogu was known for his commitment to the promotion of legislations to enhance good governance, particularly in the area of education, infrastructure and social amenities. “He was one of the frontline party leaders that worked assiduously to entrench the APC in the South East. He always made himself available to serve the party whenever called upon,” the statement also read. The APC extended heartfelt condolences to his immediate family, constituents, National Assembly, particularly the Senate and the government and people of Imo State. The party prayed the Almighty God to grant the late Senator Uwajumogu eternal rest and those left behind the strength to bear the “painful loss”.
