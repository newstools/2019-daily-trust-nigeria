A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State, Engr. Gideon Ikhine, says the party has jettisoned imposition and impunity, following its abysmal performance during the state assembly election. Engr. Ikhine, who said this yesterday in Benin while answering questions from journalists during a media parley, stated that PDP leaders in the state were better prepared to reposition the party ahead of the 2020 governorship election. He said they had discovered that the people of the state still believed in the party despite being out of power for over 10 years. “The PDP has thrown away imposition and impunity, if not for anything, we learnt lesson from the House of Assembly election. Those anomalies have since been corrected,” he added. According to him, they have taken responsibility for the misfortune that has befallen the party in the state and have resolved to make it viable by winning elections again. While expressing his desire to bring back the state’s lost glory, he called on the PDP faithful in the state to close ranks and chart a common course for the party.  2015: PDP, APC and the rest of us How PDP is picking its pieces in Kogi 2019:  PDP will rebound in Kogi — Ex-Gov Idris
