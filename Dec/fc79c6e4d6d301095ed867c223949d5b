The Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) has said its 10-year development plan to grow local content in the oil and gas industry from the current 30 per cent to 70 per cent by 2027 is achievable. Part of the target is to oversee the in-country retention of about $14 billion out of the $20 billion annual oil industry capital spending by 2020 and create over 300,000 direct jobs. Speaking at a capacity building workshop for media stakeholders in Abuja during the week, the General Manager Research, Statistics and Development at the agency, Mr. Abdulmalik Halilu, said the success of the 10-year roadmap would be dependent on five pillars. Mr. Halilu, in his presentation, ‘X-Raying the Nigerian Content 10 Year Strategic Roadmap Targets and Milestones’, listed the pillars to include: technical capability development, compliance and enforcement, enabling business environment, organisation capability and sectoral and regional market. He said the five pillars rested on funding, regulatory environment, stakeholders’ development, including increasing research, and overall development in the sector. Earlier, the agency’s General Manager, Corporate Communications and Zonal Coordination, Dr. Ginah O. Ginah, said the creation of the board through the enactment of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development (NOGIC) Act in 2010 has unlocked unprecedented opportunities for indigenous companies in the industry. On the $200 million Nigerian Content Intervention Fund (NCI Fund) launched by the board to provide funding support to local service companies, Ginah stated that 70 per cent of the fund has been disbursed to beneficiaries.
