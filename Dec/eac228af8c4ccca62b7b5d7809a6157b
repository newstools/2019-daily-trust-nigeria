The Catholic Bishop of Ekiti Diocese, Reverend Felix Femi Ajakaye, has called on Nigerians to shun rituals in the name of sacrifice. Bishop Ajakaye condemned sacrifices placed at strategic places on roads, which he frowned as rampant in the country. He called on the people to shun any practice that did not glorify God in whatever form, even if it came from people expected to show good examples. Ajakaye made the remarks in Ado-Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital, at the end of the 2019 mass held for the lay faithful of the Catholic Diocese of Ekiti held at St Patrickâ€™s Cathedral. Three priests of the diocese who clocked 70 years old were honoured. In his sermon, Rev Arinola Abegunde urged Nigerians to be hopeful, saying that things would be better in the country.
