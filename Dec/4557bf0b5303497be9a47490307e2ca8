The Senate yesterday mandated its Committee on National Security and Intelligence to investigate the last Friday’s alleged court invasion by operatives of Department of State Services who re-arrested the convener of the #RevolutionNow Movement, Omoyele Sowore. This followed a motion by Senator Bamidele Opeyemi who said the alleged invasion was generating controversy. “Yet, much as we cannot just jump into conclusion, is it also a fact that we cannot pretend not to know that Nigerians are not concerned about this development,” he said. The committee is to submit its report within one week. Senate orders probe into DSS court invasion Sowore: FG investigates alleged court invasion by DSS Atiku wants probe into DSS court invasion
