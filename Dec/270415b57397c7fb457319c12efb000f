Jasawa Community Development Association (JCDA), has decried the delay in accessing  Central Bank Nigeria Agric-Business/Small and Medium Enterprises Investment Scheme (AGSMEIS), saying the delay is frustrating the Small Scale and Businesses Enterprises in Plateau State. The chairman of the Economic and Business Committee of the community, Sani Tanko who stated this at the end of a stakeholder’s meeting said the delay was making them to lose confidence in present administration’s promises and polices to alleviate bedeviling poverty in Nigeria. He said CBN has launched the scheme since 2017 but the scheme has not yet made any significant impact to SSBE because they were yet to access the loans initiated. The chairman noted the community had submitted hundreds of particulars to the CBN through Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) for two years but not received any response from the agency which was later substituted with Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agriculture Lending ( NIRSAL)to champion the process. The chairman however appealed to Federal Government to intervene and check the alleged malpractices and delays surrounding the scheme and quicken the process for the benefit of small scale businesses in Nigeria.
