Fidelity Bank Plc has rewarded 13 customers with N15 million in the first draw of its Get Alert in Millions (GAIM) Season 4 Savings promo. The bank rewarded the lucky customers at the prize presentation ceremonies held in different locations across the country recently.  Two Lagos customers namely Mr Okechukwu Darlington and Mr Chisom Akazie won one million Anita each. Other customers carted away consolation prizes of power generating sets, refrigerator and television sets. Speaking at the prize presentation ceremony, Darlington, a business man said he never imagined himself becoming a winner and even thought the call from the bank was a scam. Akazie also commended the bank for keeping to their word. He urged other customers to continue to have faith in the financial institution. Mr Ken Opara, Regional Bank Head (RBH), Ikeja said that the promo was instituted to encourage savings culture and to reward loyal customers. “The GAIM 4 is the 9th promo being conducted by the bank in the last 13 years and this is not about Fidelity Bank mobilising savings. “It is worthy to note that similar presentations are also going on in our locations outside Lagos as a total of 31 winners that emerged would be presented with their prizes and N1.5 million worth of airtime will be also given to 1,600 customers as weekly give away”, he said. Mr Bashir Ale, Chief Executive Officer, Lagos State Lotteries Board, congratulated the winners and urged them to use the money judiciously. He noted that more than 94 per cent of Nigerians were living off a low-budget while adding that the board would continue to protect its citizens from frivolous gaming and gambling. The savings promo, which will end in April 2020, will see customers cart away a total of N120 million in cash prizes.
