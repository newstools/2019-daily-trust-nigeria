The Minister of State, Mines and Steel Development, Dr Uchechukwu S. Ogah, has called for strong partnership between the federal and state governments to generate more revenue from solid minerals. He made the appeal during a familiarisation visit to the Imo State Governor, Rt Hon. Emeka Ihedioha, recently at government house, Owerri. In a statement, the minister said such collaboration between government and traditional rulers will ensure that mining revenue due to the federal government is recognised, properly articulated and paid into the Federation Account, adding that will ensure that states benefit from the current 13 per cent derivation granted by federal government based on their mineral deposits.
