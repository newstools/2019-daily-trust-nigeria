The Israel Ibeleme Foundation has rewarded eight police officers with gifts and a promise of scholarship for one of their children each for outstanding performance and personal sacrifice while carrying out their duties. The police officers, mostly traffic wardens, who were drawn from divisions within the Metro Area Command, received hampers filled with groceries yesterday at the command’s headquarters in Maitama, Abuja. Presenting the items to the recipients, CEO of the foundation, Mr. Israel Ibeleme, said the gesture was to inspire them do more at their respective duty posts. He said the traffic wardens risk their lives every day to bring sanity on the city’s roads and they deserved to be recognized and rewarded. “We see them every day on the roads, risking their lives to bring sanity to the ever busy road so we saw the need to encourage them to do more to bring safety to the roads,” he said. In his opening remarks, the Area Commander, Metro, ACP Nuruddeen Sabo, said it was a morale booster for those who were chosen and it was also an opportunity for those who were not chosen to emulate them so that, together they can make Abuja safe. He thanked the foundation for its benevolence and urged it to continue to impact positively on the society. On his part, the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) of Maitama, M.B. Magaiwata, urged the recipients, Inspector Sunday Abah, Inspector, Anthonia Uchendu, Inspector Jibrin Dada, Inspector Audu Isah, and traffic wardens Selbol Audu Abdullahi Isah,  Usman Yakubu, Emmanuel Kopwul, to work harder and justify the honour given to them.
