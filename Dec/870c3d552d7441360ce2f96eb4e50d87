The Nigeria Labour Congress has asked states still negotiating with it and those yet to set up negotiating committees on the consequential adjustment of the N30,000 new minimum wage to either conclude negotiations before the end of December 2019 or expect “a not-too-friendly” New Year gift from it. NLC President Ayuba Wabba, in a statement yesterday, said workers and pensioners deserve the very best of care and welfare during this yuletide “because they are the ones that turn the wheel that creates the wealth.” He said political leaders and elite should dedicate themselves to ideals espoused by Christmas. He expressed hope that in the coming year, Nigerians would reap “tonnes of positive turnaround in their existential realities as consequence of re commitment of our leadership to common goal.” He added: “We encourage Nigerian pensioners and workers in every nook and cranny of our country – our teachers, our seamen, civil servants our engineers, the labourers, the cleaners, factory workers, our journalists, our medical professionals, workers in the transport sector, bankers, Nigerians working in the hospitality industry, out soldiers and law enforcement officers, to take some moments this Christmas to savour the joy of their toil brings to millions of the compatriots.” Minimum wage: Governors’ stubbornness won’t distract us - Wabba Minimum wage: Retirees seek increment in pension Minimum Wage: Labour urges FG to finalise salary adjustment
