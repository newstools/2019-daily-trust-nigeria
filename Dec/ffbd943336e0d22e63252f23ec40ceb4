The All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) has urged the Federal Government to roll out massive palliative measures for the masses, saying this year’s Christmas is coming at a very critical time in the nation’s history. The National Chairman of the party, Dr Victor Ike Oye, said on Tuesday that despite the social, economic and political challenges facing the nation, there are still many reasons to be grateful to God, at least, for keeping the citizens alive and united to face these challenges. “The coming year will be fruitful, peaceful and progressive for Nigerians as we hope that the efforts made in the past five years to take Nigeria to the ‘next level’ will begin to bear fruits. “We urge the federal government to factor the sufferings of the people into whatever programmes it plans for 2020 as anything outside of this will increase their hardship. “The federal government owes the people of Nigeria adequate security; more amenities  such as steady electricity, potable water, and medicare; more food; quality education; and general atmosphere of peace and tranquility,” Oye said. He urged all Nigerians to remain steadfast in prayer and patriotic service to the nation, while hoping for the best in 2020. He said, “We single out the administration of Governor Willie Obiano of Anambra State for special commendation for the able way it has piloted the affairs of the state, especially in the areas of security, road construction, food production, education, general infrastructure and regular payment of workers’ salaries and leave allowances, pensions and gratuities, asking God to bless and keep the governor.”  Maku urges FG to monitor utilisation of states''monthly allocations 2019‘ll be better for Nigerians – APGA 2019: Sam Amadi, Okey Ezeh, 20 others jostle for Imo APGA ticket
