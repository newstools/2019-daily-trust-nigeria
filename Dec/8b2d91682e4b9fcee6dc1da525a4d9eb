The APC in Ogun State yesterday described the rejection of Governor Dapo Abiodun’s commissioners’ list by some loyalists of former Governor Olusegun Osoba as a distraction to both the party and the government. Daily Trust reports that scores of  APC members loyal to Osoba had on Sunday rejected the list, insisting that the composition did not represent the proclamation by Abiodun, that “he will run all inclusive government in the State.” But the Publicity Secretary of the APC  Caretaker Committee, Tunde Oladunjoye, in a statement issued yesterday, said the composition was based on the lists of nominees sent by the party leaders to the governor. According to him, the conclusion reached at the party’s caucus meeting, on Friday, October 11 was that every leader of the party in each Federal Constituency should forward the list of candidates to be considered by the Governor as Commissioners. Oladunjoye said, contrary to some people’s views that the list was lopsided, investigation by the party revealed that majority of the party members were satisfied with the list. Meanwhile, Ogun State House of Assembly yesterday confirmed 17 out of 18 commissioner – nominees sent to the legislature by Governor Abiodun. The 17 commissioner – designates had separately appeared and responded to questions before the assembly on Monday. However, one of them, Dr Tomi Coker, failed to appear for the screening.   It was learnt that the nominee equally did not send copies of her resume to the parliament, a requirement for the screening.
