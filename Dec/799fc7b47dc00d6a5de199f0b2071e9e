Emmanuel Ishaya, a cripple, is one of the 5, 000 beneficiaries of the Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Tukur Buratai’s medical outreach for locals at Rigachikun, Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna State. Emmanuel, who told Arewa Trust that he used to crawl on the ground to and from his business premises, where he makes shoes, appreciated the medical gesture as well as the donation, which he said would make life easier for him. According to him, “When I am crawling to work, some good Samaritans who know me, do carry me on their motorcycles or bicycles to my place of business.” The outreach, which was part of the activities marking this year’s Chief of Army Staff annual conference, was targeted at selected community with little or no medical facility. According to COAS, the Rigachikun community was targeted for the medical outreach as the host community of the ongoing conference, aimed at enhancing civil-military relationship. Represented by the Chief of Administration (Army), Nigerian Army, Major General Sani Yusuf, the COAS added that the medical outreach was also part of the Nigerian Army Corporate Social Responsibility to its host community. “Since coming on board of the current COAS, the issue of winning the mind of civil populace has been given top priority through the newly created department of Civil-Military Affairs. They have been coming to receive medical attention since the commencement of the conference. “We also have our CSR in communities where we have our barracks. It has been our regular programme as one of the major exercises that has come to stay in Nigerian Army,’’ he said. Responding on behalf of the community, Sarkin Sabon-Gari, Rigachikun, Alhaji Abubakar Ja’afar, thanked the COAS for the intervention, noting that the common aliment in his domain is high blood pressure.
