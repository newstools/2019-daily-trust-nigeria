The Ogun State government says it has not approved the appointment of any candidate to fill the vacant stool of Aboro of Ibeseland, in the Egbado North local government area. The clarification followed a protest at the Governor’s Office yesterday over the selection of a new Oba, with a group of Ibese indigenes bearing different placards with inscriptions asking for the respect of due process and implementation of the Ibese Obaship Declaration of 1957. However, the government assured that once the Commissioners have been sworn in, a process for the selection of the Oba would be reopened and due process followed. Governor Dapo Abiodun said this yesterday through the Permanent Secretary, Minister of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Kunle Osota, while addressing a protest by the Oloko ruling house at his office in Oke-Mosan. Gov Abiodun warned that whoever was parading himself as an Oba-elect would be doing so at his own volition. The Asiwaju of Ibeseland, Dr Hezy Idowu, who addressed the government’s representatives, alleged that some powerful people in Ibeseland were threatening the peace of the land by subverting the process, alleging that those working against the choice of the people had the support of the Secretary to the Ogun State Government, Tokunbo Talabi. He said that the sole Obaship candidate of the Oloko Ruling House was Prince Azeez Adedimeji Idowu, whom he added had been “rightly selected, nominated and presented.”  Protests dog Gov Amosun’s valedictory installation of new traditional rulers Ibese community rejects ‘imposition’ of monarch Why we recommended demotion of 75 traditional rulers  –  Ogun panel
