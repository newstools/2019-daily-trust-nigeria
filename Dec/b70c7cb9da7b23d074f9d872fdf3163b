The National Working Committee (NWC) of the PDP says it has activated internal reconciliation machinery to halt the disagreement between Governors Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa state and Nyesom Wike of Rivers state. The two South South governors are at loggerheads over oil wells, political differences among others. The PDP in a statement yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said it had noted the issues and would settle the matter amicably. The party said the disagreement was informed by the love each of the governors had for their States and the people.
