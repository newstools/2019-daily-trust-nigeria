The Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) has said that President Muhammadu Buhari has raised the bar in open governance with his directive that the country’s daily income and expenditure be put in the public domain. According to the group, government finances had always been opaque and shrouded in secrecy. BMO, in a statement signed by its Chairman Niyi Akinsiju and Secretary Cassidy Madueke, said that only a President with a clear conscience and mind could have insisted on an Open Treasury Portal (OTP) where information on financial transactions are provided to the public on a daily basis. “This is nothing but a bold step by a President that is averse to corruption and is prepared to strengthen government institutions. “Never in the history of the country has an administration been so prepared to open itself to public scrutiny. “We see this as an affirmation of President Buhari’s readiness to run an open administration such that any information about government finances could be readily available to members of  the public. “For the avoidance of doubt, Nigerians would now have daily access to information on payments from N10m from the Treasury as well as payments above N5m from all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) on the OTP.
