Following the signing  into law of the new Kano emirates bill, Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State has revealed that he will personally announce the chairman of the State Council of Emirs soon. This was contained in a statement signed by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary Malam Abba Anwar. According to the statement, the governor made this known during an exclusive live Channels Television programme, State of the Nation. The statement noted that the governor assured the people of Kano State that the new first class Emirs of Bichi, Karaye, Rano and Gaya have come to stay for the overall socio-economic development of the state. Ganduje said the law gave him the right to appoint the chairman of the State Council of Chiefs, which is the central Council for the five first class Emirs, apart from their individual Emirate Councils. He recalled a similar demand during the reign of the late former governor of the old Kano State, Muhammad Abubakar Rimi, and how the process didn’t comply with the provision of the constitution then, which  made it easy for the succeeding administration in the state to stop that action.
