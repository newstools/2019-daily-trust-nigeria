I tried so hard to refrain from talking about Sowore’s continued incarceration. But I have lost that battle. I would like to understand why someone who has been granted bail by the court is still being held in custody. This move by DSS undermines the power of the court. Sowore’s fundamental human rights are being violated and no one is batting an eye toward his plight. I implore the government to intercede on his behalf, so he can go home to his family.
