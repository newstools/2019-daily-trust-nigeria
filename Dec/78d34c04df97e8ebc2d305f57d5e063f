The Chairman of Kwali Area Council, Danladi Chiya, has urged the Federal Government to allocate enough funds to the area councils by next year, 2020 to enable the chairmen execute more projects that will impact on the lives of their people. Chiya made the call when he received heads of departments of the council, led by the head of administration of the council, Alhaji Abdulkarim Attahiru, at his private residence who paid him  Christmas homage yesterday. He said despite the council’s financial struggles and challenges, it has been able to utilize its meagre resources in embarking on viable projects that can impact on the lives of his people as well as empowering of youths and women. “We are asking God by the year 2020, God should touch the heart of the government to give us more funds so that we can touch the lives of our people, “ he said. He added “we have a lot of zeal towards what we want to achieve but because of the predicament of the resources, we are left behind. We are now calling on federal government to give us better allocation so that we can touch the lives of our people.” The chairman appreciated the heads of the council’s departments in felicitating with him during the Christmas and for cooperating with his administration towards making the council great. ‘Kwali council's 2020 budget will focus on viable projects’ Youth become liability when unemployed - Kwali boss Group declares support for Kwali APC  candidate
