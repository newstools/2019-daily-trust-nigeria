Elder statesman Dr Junaid Mohammed has backed Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State over the creation of four more emirate councils. Mohammed, who spoke to journalists in Abuja, said the decision to create emirate councils was in line with laid down rules and regulations. The second republic minority leader of the House of Representatives upbraided the Bashir Tofa-led Kano Elders under the umbrella of Advocates For United Kano who opposed the plan on the ground that it was an attempt to destroy 1000 years old heritage of the Kano emirate council because of political consideration. He cautioned the Tofa-led group not to play politics with the issue since it was in tandem with the aspirations of the people of Kano State. “Today, they have five emirates in Jigawa State. Yet, Kano is three times the size of Jigawa State. Why didn’t anybody say due to history, no Emirate should be created apart from Hadeija, Gumel and Kazaure?” Mohammed said.
