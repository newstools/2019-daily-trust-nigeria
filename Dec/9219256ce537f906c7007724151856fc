Over 77,000 teachers are reportedly writing Professional Qualifying Examination (PQE) across the country but the exercise was postponed in Ekiti State due to technical challenges. Registrar, Teacher Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN), Professor Josiah Ajiboye said after monitoring the exam in Abuja, that apart from Ekiti State where there was a technical problem, it was conducted smoothly in other places. He said, “Over 77,000 teachers are writing the exam, which is going on smoothly in Lagos where we have over 8,000 candidates, the highest in the country. In Ibadan too, which used to be our crisis-prone area, I can report to Nigerians that the exam is going on well with over 5,000 candidates. The only place where we have a challenge is Ekiti State due to the technical problem at a Computer Based Test Center. The exam will be rescheduled for next weekend or thereabout.” Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education, Architect Sunny Echono said government would avoid paying lip service to teachers’ welfare to ensure that effective teachers stay in schools. He said, “We are happy that Mr. President is paying more attention to the welfare of teachers. Part of the local government reform is for teachers to get their salaries on time just like the legislators and judicial officers. We are going to be looking at special allowances for teachers in the areas of science and technical education and those who are going to rural communities.” Timetable clash: Candidates forfeit SSCE to write UTME in Benue 77,827 teachers to write qualifying exams Teacher shortage reaches all-time low
