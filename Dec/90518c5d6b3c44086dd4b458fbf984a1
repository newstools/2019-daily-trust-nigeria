The Igbo Leadership Development Foundation (ILDF) has said that it would hold a grand meeting of national leaders over President Muhammadu Buhari’s comment on 2023 Presidency as contained in his maiden national address. Leaders of the foundation Dr. Godwin I. Udibe, Dr. Law Mefor, Dr. Emeka Okengwu, Nze Elvis Agukwe, Dr. Ifedi Okwenna and Comrade Auston Ifedinezi addressed the press in Abuja yesterday. Dr. Law Mefor who presented the position of the group recalled that President Buhari, in his maiden media chat, challenged the South East to organize and assert their rights within an indivisible, indissoluble Nigeria to aspire for the nation’s presidency. “We also note that the five states in the South-east will not make anyone from there Nigerian President. In fact, the Constitution requires a spread of at least 25 percent in at least in 24 States to produce a Nigeria President,” Mefor said. He said that it was the reality of the situation that informed their decision in conjunction with Igbo Renaissance Foundation, World Igbo Summit Group and others to convene the “Great Debate on Restructuring and Rotation of Presidential powers in Nigeria” on January 30, 2020 in Abuja.
