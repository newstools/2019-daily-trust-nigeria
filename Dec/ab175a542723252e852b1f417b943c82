The 35-year-old marriage between Mr. Micheal Longe and his wife, Magaret, has been dissolved by an Ado-Ekiti Customary Court sitting in Ikole-Ekiti. ‎The President of the court, Mrs Yemisi Ojo, who dissolved the marriage yesterday, based the grounds on desertion, lack of affection and that the differences between the couples were irreconcilable. Mrs. Ojo ‎ordered both parties should go their separate ways as they stand unmarried. The court president ‎further ordered both parties to stay away from each other’s premises except due consent was obtained, advising both parties to maintain peace. It will be recalled that the petitioner, Mr Micheal Longe, 75, a Surveyor‎ and registered draftsman sought the dissolution of his association with the respondent on the grounds of desertion since 1988. He informed the court that the union was blessed with a child named Mrs  Mercy Olaoye, 35, and currently living in her husband’s house. Longe explained that his wife deserted him since 1988 only to come back in 2010 when he needed someone to be with him. He told the court that since his wife came back, things have not been peaceful between them as the respondent began to threaten him. The petitioner recalled that he had once instituted a case against his wife in court and he later withdrew the case after family members intervened but the respondent refused to change from her bad behaviours. Longe, however, prayed the court to dissolve his association with his estranged wife and also appealed to the court to restrain her from visiting his house. The respondent, Mrs Magaret Longe, did not honour the court summons after she was served on several occasions to give her own evidence.
