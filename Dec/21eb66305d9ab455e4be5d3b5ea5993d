The National Library has sensitised more than 500, 000 Nigerians including residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) on how to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Prof. Lenrie Aina, who disclosed this while addressing journalists in Abuja, said the library has taken SDGs’ message to all the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) through its Readership Promotion Campaign. He said though the campaign had been ongoing before the release of the SDGs, it was modified and adapted in order to achieve the SDGs. Aina said that several rural communities, motor parks, hospitals and correctional centres were visited during which books were donated and empowerment programmes were undertaken, while food and other items were donated to youths, girl-children, and other vulnerable people in the states. He said the operations of the National Library have evolved, as it now looks at means of bettering the lives of Nigerians. “We are doing a lot of things but we are not showcasing ourselves,” he said, adding that the library as a member of the International Federation of Library Association, has access to a pool of information on how to engage  Nigerians to achieve these goals. “Library is very important in promoting Sustainable Development Goals because by training we are supposed to deal with the public and all the SDGs are for the public and that is why we are very much involved. We are expected to serve all categories of users in different ways that is why we are really involved in all the goals. We promote it everywhere,” he said. Aina said the library would have done better if it were well-funded to pursue the SDGs through its wide contact and reach within the country.
