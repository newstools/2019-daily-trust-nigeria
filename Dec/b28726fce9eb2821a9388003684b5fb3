The All Progressives Congress (APC) Youth Parliament in Bauchi State has thrown its weight behind state chairman of the party, Uba Nana and other party officials. They are also berating returnees of the party who are allegedly planning to factionalize it to bring about turmoil and fracas within the state. Secretary General of the Parliament, Nasiru Cigari, in a statement issued to newsmen yesterday in Bauchi, alleged that the returnees had worked assiduously for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and other parties during the last general elections when they failed to secure APC tickets to actualise their political aspirations. The statement read: “The only way, according to them, is to fractionalise the party and bring about turmoil and fracas within its hierarchy. This is in their quest to secure tickets in the forthcoming party congress and by extension the general election by hijacking the party’s structure.” Returnees planning to factionalize  Bauchi  APC - Youths 2019: Challenges before senators, reps in new political parties Re-run: How governors would emerge in states -CDD
