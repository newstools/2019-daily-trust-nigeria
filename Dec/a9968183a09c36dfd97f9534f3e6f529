The newly posted Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, Mr. Edet Sunday Akpan, has charged staff in the ministry to be creative and committed to help the minister achieve his mandate. A press release from the ministry states that Mr. Akpan expressed delight on the warm reception, and thanked his predecessor for the good work he has done. “I thank God for His grace to make me part of this family. I assure you to continue the good work my friend and colleague has done, and if possible to improve on it. “There must be creativity and commitment on the part of staff so as to ensure that the ministers meet their mandate of driving the sector to achieve the diversification of the economy,” he said. In his handing-over remarks, the out-going permanent secretary, Dr. Abdulkadir Mu’azu, commended the management staff of the ministry for the support given him, and implored them to extend same to the in-coming permanent secretary, saying it is the only way to move the sector forward. He told Mr. Akpan that the sector is very technical and he has a lot to learn from the directors as he received briefings. He said the minerals sector, which had one time been in the forefront in foreign earnings to the country, was for long neglected. However, he said, the present administration has taken it as second to the agricultural sector in the diversification of the economy as such a lot had been done in the recent past in the sector towards meeting the goal.
