Vice President Yemi Osinbajo says the Federal Government has massively invested in critical infrastructure with a view to tapping from about $200bn accruing from the African  tourism. Osinbajo noted that poor infrastructure had deprived Nigeria and other African countries of huge economic benefits derivable from tourism. He spoke in Abeokuta, Ogun State, while inaugurating multi billion naira Conference Hotel, owned by former Governor, Otunba Gbenga Daniel. According to him, tourism has increasingly become the driver of economic activities and  major job creators around the world. Quoting the World Tourism Organization, Osinbajo said tourism and hospitality sector in Africa as a potential of over $200 billion out of which 50 billion has been developed due to poor infrastructure. The Vice President said President Muhammadu Buhari led government had invested in road and rail projects as part of moves to drive economy through tourism. Osinbajo asked Nigerians to emulate Daniel by investing in hospitality business in order to drive the economy and job creation. While describing the project as “remarkable and landmark”, Osinbajo said the hotel has capacity to provide 1,000 direct and indirect jobs. …Disowns VON DG on medical tourism expenses Zambian President, Osinbajo laud Dangote on African expansion Adesina assumes duty at AfDB, promises to curb inequality
