A group, Anambra Demand for Soludo (ADS), has urged former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, to contest for the 2021 governorship of the state. The group made the call during its stakeholders’ meeting held in Awka, the state capital. The convener of the meeting, Mr Peter Nnamdi, who spoke through an All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) chieftain, Chief Jude Emecheta, said Soludo is presently the only person that can lead the state to greater heights. Emecheta said the former CBN governor should be prevailed upon to show interest in the position again because he had “creditably” done well  for Nigeria and the world. He also urged the state chapter of APGA to give him automatic ticket to contest the governorship seat rather than allowing people to waste money on primaries. Emecheta also called on other aspirants to step down for Soludo because he remained the best person that can move the state to economic greatness.
