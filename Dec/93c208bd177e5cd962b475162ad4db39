Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State has condemned Tuesday’s attack on Otuoke home of former President Goodluck Jonathan in Bayelsa State. Okowa, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Olisa Ifeajika in Asaba, said the incident was disturbing and unwarranted. The governor said the incident was more condemnable because the former President was a peace loving man who always preached peaceful political engagements. He said Jonathan who had been a great patriot and a promoter of peaceful politics did not deserve to be attacked in his home town or anywhere else.
