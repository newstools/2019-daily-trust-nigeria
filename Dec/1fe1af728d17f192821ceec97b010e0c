Plateau State Governor, Simon Bako Lalong has said his administration was working with a group of consultants to leverage on technology and strengthen institutional capacity for effective revenue collection and accountability. The governor stated that legislation was in the works to enable MDAs offer better services to the business community quickly and efficiently. Speaking at the 3rd Executive Governor’s Interactive Dinner with the Business Community in Plateau State at the weekend, Lalong said he was committed to improving the business enabling environment and IGR which he said has gone up slightly but was a far cry to what can be collected. The engagement organized by the Plateau Investment and Property Development Company (PIPC) and Plateau State Microfinance Development Agency (PLASMIDA) was supported by German agency for international cooperation, GIZ. He said following the adoption of a 5- year Strategic Development Plan, the state has benchmarked its plans and ties them to revenue generation templates and timelines. “Our administration has continued to work on the ease of doing business by removing obstacles in the way of investors. We have established the One Stop Shop to make it easier for investors to get information and other facilitation under one roof to save time and cost,” he said. Vice President of Plateau Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (PLACIMA), Yop Gbadamasi said businesses thrive in areas with industrial parks and urged the governor to revisit the idea of industrial parks especially in the local governments.
