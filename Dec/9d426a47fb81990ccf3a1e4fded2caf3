Personnel of the Nigerian Army have restored normalcy to Gbishe community after a series of herders’ invasion, communal crises and other forms of crimes. Gbishe is the home of an allegedly most wanted criminal kingpin, Terwase Akwaza popularly known as “Gana” in Kastina-Ala Local Government Area of Benue State. The military also dismissed fears from residents of Benue state on an alleged planned to phase out the ongoing Operation Whirl Stroke (OPWS).
