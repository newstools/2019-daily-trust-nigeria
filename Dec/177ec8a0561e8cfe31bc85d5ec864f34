The Director General (DG) of National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), Malam Is’haq Modibbo Kawu, has charged the people of Kwara State to support the present APC government in the state for a better future. Kawu gave the charge in Ilorin, the Kwara state capital at the 5th anniversary symposium of Fresh Insight newspaper, held at the Banquet Hall of Government House, Ilorin, Kwara State. He was the guest lecturer at the event themed “Kwara: Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow”. He said, “as a citizen of Kwara state; a citizen that feels a tremendous gratitude to our state and all the opportunities Kwara state gave me, to be educated; to work, and to become a professional in the media, as well as to begin to impact upon life. The story of our state started on May 27, 1967. I am very lucky to have lived through the entire history of our state. “I have lived through some of the most impressive phases of the development of Kwara State; periods that spoke to a genuine commitment to the development of the structures of our state as well as of its various peoples. “There was no area of development that is not witnessing incremental development, in those early years of our state. Healthcare facilities are opened all over; agricultural programs inherited from the old Northern Regional government are not only maintained, but improved upon.” He, however, affirmed his confidence about the future of the state under the present leadership.
