The FCT Police Command’s Criminal Investigation Department (CID) is investigating two vigilante members in Dakwa, Abuja, over alleged killing of a labourer and chopping of the two arms of his colleague. It was gathered that Muhammad Ibrahim, a vigilante commander in the area and his colleague Nura Shuaibu, allegedly murdered Muhammad, aka Papa, and  amputated Hussaini Muhammad’s arms. The two suspects were arrested over the incident, while another suspect, simply identified as MD is still at large, a police source privy to the investigation, revealed yesterday. Speaking from his hospital bed on Wednesday, the arms amputation victim, Muhammad, said the suspects who he was able to identify, met him and his murdered colleague around 2am where they were working and decided to pass the night. “On arrival, they accused Papa who was an ex-vigilante member, of involvement in the killing of their late colleague, Adamu Zakari, and when they discovered that I recognised them, they stabbed me on the stomach and amputated my arms. They never expected that I would survive when they fled the scene,” he said. The Zuba Divisional Police Officer (DPO) CSP Muhammad Yahaya, who confirmed the incident, added that the case of the other murdered person which was linked to this, was reported to the Sabon Wuse police division under Niger State Command.
