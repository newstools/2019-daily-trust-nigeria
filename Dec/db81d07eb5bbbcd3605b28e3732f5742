The Dean, Faculty of Education, Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, Professor Yahaya K. Kajuru, has said that the university is not discriminating against physically-challenged persons in its admission and employment policies. He stated this during an event organised by the university as part of the World Disability Day. Kajuru explained that some of the persons living with disability are more intelligent and committed than their colleagues who are physically alright, adding that ABU would continue to give the physically-challenged persons more opportunities to explore their potentials. Speaking at the event, wife of the Kaduna state governor, Hajiya Aisha Ummi-El-Rufa’i, said the state government was giving the welfare of people living with disability serious attention in order to integrate them into the society and improve their well-being. Ummi-El-Rufa’i explained that physically-challenged persons are getting fair share in all the state government empowerment programmes, saying that the goal is to make them self-reliant and contribute their quota in the development of the state and the nation at large. She counseled Nigerians on the need to stop discriminating against persons living with disability as they were creators of the Supreme Being like any other citizen. Ummi-El-Rufa’i advised the physically-challenged persons to strive to seek for knowledge as a means of addressing all their predicaments. In a lecture, Professor Julius A. Ademokoya, urged all relevant stakeholders to continue to provide enabling environment for physically-challenged persons to make their contribution for national development.
