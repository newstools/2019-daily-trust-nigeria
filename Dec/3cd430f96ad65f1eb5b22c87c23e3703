But an Abuja based financial inclusion specialist Mr Tiko Okoye said the Federal Government’s efforts at stabilising the foreign exchange and controlling inflation will come to nought if the production sector of the economy is neglected. “No matter the amount of monetary policy the CBN applies to control inflation, it will not work without growing the real sector’’, Okoye said. He called for the decimalisation of the country’s currency to make it stronger and stable.
