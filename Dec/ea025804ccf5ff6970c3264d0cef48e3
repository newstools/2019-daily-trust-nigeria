Minister of Mines and Steel Development Arc. Olamilekan Adegbite has reiterated the need for professionalism in the extractive industry. Adegbite spoke on Tuesday on the occasion of the 9th Induction Ceremony of the Council of Nigerian Mining Engineers and Geoscientists (COMEG) in Abuja. “The importance of professionalism in the extractive industry cannot be overemphasised, as such all hands must be on deck to ensure that COMEG succeeds in its mandate as the foremost regulator of the professionals in the sector. “You are all aware of the importance President Muhammadu Buhari has placed on the mines and steel sector as one of the major focus of his administration with commensurate support in funding. In return, this sector is expected to provide jobs and prosperity for Nigerians. This cannot be possible if it is operated as an all comers affair,” he said. The guest speaker at the event, Prof Shedrack B. Jatau, said the mission of COMEG is to be proactive in ensuring quality manpower for the Nigerian extractive industries while maintaining professionalism and training amongst others.
