The federal government has reiterated Nigeria’s goal of launching a road infrastructure programme for the West African region that will ultimately integrate the African continent. The MD/CEO of FERMA, Engr. Nuruddeen Rafindadi, stated this at the opening ceremony of the maiden edition of the Nigeria-South Africa Integration Road Transport Infrastructure Initiative event held in Abuja. He said the event was a collaborative initiative between the South African National Roads Agency Limited (SANRAL), the Development Bank of South Africa (DBSA), and Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) on how to fashion a transport and logistics infrastructure agenda for the African sub-region. He said FERMA was delighted to be a partner in the collaboration with the agency tasked with the mandate of maintaining federal roads in Nigeria having the largest network of roads south of the Sahara. Nigeria’s road network is about 200,000km in lane kilometres with about 35,000km gazetted as federal roads while state governments are responsible for another 32,000km, with the remaining 134,000km as rural in the purview of local governments. These roads constitute 94% of all movement on roads in the country, he said. The activities of FERMA, the MD added, are routine periodic maintenance works and that there has been an increase in that regard due to extreme weather conditions. He further said in view of the recent signing of the AfCFTA, expected to commence in 2020, the collaboration will provide a platform for member countries to communicate with each other towards resolving issues related to road transportation in West Africa. Director General of the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) Dr. Chidi K.C. Izuwah, commended all the partners in the collaboration and said he looked forward to the successful implementation of the project.
