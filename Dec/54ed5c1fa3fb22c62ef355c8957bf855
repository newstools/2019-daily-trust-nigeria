A former governor of Zamfara State,  Alhaji Abdul’aziz Yari Abubakar, says the APC still remains a formidable party to beat despite losing power in the state. Yari, who addressed a large crowd of APC members and supporters from the 14 local government areas (LGAs) of the state shortly after a stakeholders’ meeting of the party in his home town of Talata Mafara, said the APC is not a pressure group but a strong political party. He said the APC in the state had moved to resolve the crisis among party members, especially with some members of the G8 group. The former governor also urged the party supporters in the state to remain calm and law abiding citizens, adding that the party would continue to provide good leadership to ensure peace and unity within its ranks. Earlier, the state APC chairman,  Alhaji Lawal Liman, thanked the former governor for his efforts to make the party  stronger in the state and called on other party stakeholders to reunite for the progress of the party. The party chairman said the meeting was organised by the state secretariat of the party to show solidarity with the former governor as the APC leader in the state.
