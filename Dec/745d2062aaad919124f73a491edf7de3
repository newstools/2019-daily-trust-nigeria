Chairman, Senate Committee on Cooperation and Integration in Africa/NEPAD, Senator Chimaroke Nnamani, has called for harmony between and among religious adherents in order to engender peace and unity in the country. According to him, this is necessary to have a common approach towards addressing underdevelopment in Nigeria. Nnamani (Enugu East), in a goodwill message to Nigerians on Christmas celebrations, noted that the time called for unity of purpose towards tackling the issues facing Nigeria. He said: “We need to be on the same page in order to produce the desired result”. He noted that Nigeria had had her fair share of ethno-religious conflicts in the past in which the nation lost millions of naira worth of properties and scores of her productive citizens needlessly. He stated: “we must all focus on the positives without degenerating to the level of low minds who cling to primordial fault lines as their road map for survival”.
