The Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) will today unveil a register that shows the real owners of oil, gas and mining companies in Nigeria. The unveiling scheduled to hold in Abuja is in fulfilment of the global Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) standard which requires implementing countries, including Nigeria to maintain a publicly available register of the beneficial owners of the corporate entity(ies) that operate or invest in Nigeria’s extractive sector by 1st January 2020. The register will in addition disclose the identities of the individuals who own part or whole of these companies. President Muhammadu Buhari’s and Vice President Yemi Osibanjo have also at different fora in 2016 and 2017 respectively reiterated Nigeria’s commitment to the development of a public register of beneficial owners of Nigeria’s mineral assets. The development and unveiling of this register thus, is Nigeria’s fulfilment of the national commitment to beneficial ownership disclosure. NEITI in a statement said the register is the outcome of about two years of conscientious collaboration between it, the Directorate of Petroleum Resources (DPR) and the Mining Cadastre Office among other government agencies relevant to the process.
