A Federal High Court sitting in Makurdi in Benue State on Tuesday remanded a former Vice Chancellor of the Federal University of Agriculture, Makurdi (FUAM), Prof. Emmanuel Kucha, in the custody of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in Makurdi zonal office. Justice Mobolaji Olajuwon ordered that Kucha, who was arraigned before him by the EFCC on a four-count charge of conspiracy, misappropriation of public funds, abuse of office and gratification remain in the commission’s custody until perfection of his bail condition. The court earlier heard that the former vice chancellor, being a public officer of FUAM allegedly obtained money as bribe in the course of performing his official duties. Kucha, while serving as the vice chancellor of FUAM between 2012 and 2017 in Makurdi, within the jurisdiction of the court allegedly accepted the total sum of N70.3million through several payments into his personal bank account. He however, pleaded not guilty when the charges were read to him. Prosecution counsel, Y. Y. Tarfa, prayed for a date to open his case even as he confirmed to the court that he received the bail application of the defendant. The defence counsel, Timothy Dim, however moved his client’s bail application and urged the court to grant him bail on liberal terms. Dim also asked the court to remand the defendant in EFCC custody, pending the perfection of his bail condition which the court granted in the sum of N10 million with one surety in like sum. Justice Olajuwon has adjourned the matter to January 5, 2020 for commencement of trial. Court remands ex-Makurdi varsity VC in EFCC custody FUAM gets new Vice Chancellor FUAM gets new Vice Chancellor
