Concerned Leaders of Political Parties (CLPP) yesterday clashed in Abuja with two other political groups – Grand Coalition of Political Parties (GCPP) and Forum of Governorship Candidates (FGCI)  – over the election of Governor Emeka Ihedioha of Imo State which was recently upheld by the Court of Appeal. National Chairman of New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP) Chief Agbo Major, who addressed a press conference on behalf of CLPP, claimed that Ihedioha  was not a product of “genuine” election. Major argued that the election that produced the governor was characterised by fraud and other infractions, claiming that he didn’t meet the constitutional minimum requirement of scoring 25 percent of the votes cast in each of at least two-third of the local government areas in the state. But members of the two groups led by Chief Ngwoke Frank, which were carrying banners and placards stormed the venue of the press conference at Treasure Suit, protested against the CLPP. Speaking with newsmen, Frank dispelled the allegations  by the CLPP, saying the governor was validly elected and declared winner by INEC.
