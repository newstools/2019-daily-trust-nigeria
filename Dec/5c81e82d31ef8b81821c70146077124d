A former Nigerian president, Goodluck Jonathan, has asked security agencies to immediately swing into action and bring those behind the gun attack on his residence to book. Gunmen in about five engine boats at about 1:30am on Tuesday stormed the security post located about 100 metres away from Jonathan’s residence in his hometown, Otuoke in Bayelsa State. A statement by the media adviser to Jonathan, Ikechukwu Eze said the gunmen attempted to take away a gunboat belonging to the military stationed at the creek beside the residence. He said they were however resisted by gallant soldiers who engaged them in a fire-fight. “The gunmen who couldn’t stand the firepower of the military were forced to beat a retreat. One soldier, unfortunately, lost his life in the fight while another was injured. The injured soldier who is currently receiving treatment at a medical facility in Yenagoa is in a stable state,” he said. “The former President who was not in Otuoke at the time of the attack however returned to his village early this morning to assess the situation. Dr. Jonathan promptly condemned the attack and reassured his people that there was no cause for alarm. “The former President has also condoled with the family of the deceased soldier, the military and has urged the concerned security authorities to swing into action and bring the culprits to book.” Gunmen attack ex-President Jonathan's house in Bayelsa, kill soldier Police denies knowledge of alleged attack on Oronto Douglas’s residence Presidential touch changes the story of Otueke
