The National Automotive Design and Development Council (NADDC) is to collaborate with relevant stakeholders in promoting cleaner transportation and air quality in the country. The Director General of NADDC, Mr Jelani Aliyu, stated this in Abuja at the National Stakeholders Workshop on the Implementation of Global Fuel Economy Initiative in Nigeria. Mr Aliyu said globally, air pollution has become a source for serious concern going by its effect on human health and environment, hence the need to adopt measures to combat it. According to him, the Global Fuel Economy Initiative is aimed at ensuring global doubling of the vehicle Fuel efficiency by 2050. He said this would lead to a shift from the global average vehicle fuel consumption of 8 litres per 100 kilometres in 2005 to 4 litres per 100 kilometres by 2050. The Director General stated that this would be made possible with the current vehicle technology. Mr Aliyu therefore called for effective policy that would promote the importance and manufacturing of more efficient vehicles towards repositioning the sector. He explained that NADDC would synergize with stakeholders and other government agencies on motor vehicle administration from production and import to what he described as End-of-life. Speaking on the overview of the Global Trends to Improve Vehicle Fuel Economy, a Professor from University of Nairobi, Kenya, Professor James Nyang’aya, said Nigeria has a lot to benefit from it if properly implemented.
