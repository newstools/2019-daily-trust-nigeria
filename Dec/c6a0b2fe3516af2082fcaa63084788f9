The FCT Police Command has arrested two suspects who allegedly attempted to kidnap the son of their employer in Wuye, Abuja. City News gathered that one Mrs Ogundipe of Wuye District reported to the police that she overheard her security guards, Abedeen Bogumbe and Segun Bamidele, planning to kidnap her son. The Police Area Commander for Metro, ACP Nurudden Sabo, who confirmed the incident to our reporter explained that the suspects were arrested early last week when their employer reported the alleged conspiracy. He said Mrs Ogundipe provided evidence of the kidnap plan to the police and when their recorded conversation on kidnapping  her son, who was in school, was played back, the suspects confessed to the plot, claiming that they were hatching the plan because their employer was owing them salaries. In a related incident, Sabo said the police were on the lookout for two armed men who attempted kidnapping one Mrs Sylvia Musa, a Bulgarian married to a Nigeria, at the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) quarters, Garki, on the 22 November, 2019. “The armed men who drove in a Honda car trailed Mrs Musa to the quarters and as she came out from her car, they ordered her to enter their car but she refused and raised an alarm which got the suspects scared and they fled,” he said. He added that the woman had earlier in the day received a call from a stranger who demanded that she paid money into an account and she suspected it was the same people who trailed her to her home.
