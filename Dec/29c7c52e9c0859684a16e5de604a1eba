The Managing Director of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), Mr Usman Gur Mohammed has assured that transmission wheeling capacity will reach 10,000 megawatts (MW) by July 2020. Mohammed disclosed this at a quarterly TCN briefing in Abuja last weekend. He said the massive milestones were achieved between February 2017 and October 2019 through the implementation of the Transmission Rehabilitation and Expansion Programme (TREP). He said the TREP targets raising the bulk power transmission wheeling capacity from 6,500MW to 10,000MW in 2020 and reaching 20,000MW by 2021. He disclosed that the conductors to be used for the line re-conductoring have arrived Nigeria for upgrading major lines in Lagos, Onitsha, Kaduna and many other areas which will raise the grid capacity to evacuate the 10,000MW power. The TCN boss said the capacity could be more than the projection due to other transmission lines project being delivered, including the Jos to Kaduna line which about 98 percent completed.
