The traditional ruler of Rubochi in Kuje Area Council, FCT, His Royal Highness (HRH) Alhaji Ibrahim Mohammed Pada, has called on Christian faithful to use the occasion of the Christmas to pray for God to expose those behind spate kidnapping in his chiefdom. The traditional ruler was kidnapped by gunmen who invaded his house three weeks ago and a sum of N6.5 million ransom had to be paid before for his freedom after three days in captivity. Alhaji Pada, who made the call at his palace, yesterday, in his Christmas message, urged pastors to also use the occasion to devote their sermons in church praying for God to ensure that those behind evil acts repented. He stressed on the need for both Christians and Muslims to sustain peaceful co-existence, saying the celebration of the Christmas should be one of sober reflection. The traditional ruler, while felicitating with Christians in his chiefdom as they celebrate the Christmas, urged residents to be security conscious and report any suspicious persons to security agents. “And I will also want to call on our youth, as they join their friends to celebrate the Christmas, they should stay away from social vices such as drunkenness, drug abuse, dangerous driving among others,” he said.
