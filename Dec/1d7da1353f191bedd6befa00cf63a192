The All Progressives Congress (APC) South West Forum, Federal Capital Territory (FCT) chapter, has dismissed the purported existence of a souring working relationship between President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, saying that there is no bad blood between the duo. The chairman of the forum, Pastor Olusegun Erinle, who addressed a press conference yesterday in Abuja, said both Buhari and Osinbajo have enjoyed cordial working relationship since their election in 2015. Pastor Erinle, who warned those fanning the embers of discord to repent, dismissed the story of rancour between the duo and claimed that the insinuation was orchestrated by the fifth columnist. The APC chieftain, who implored Nigerians to support the Buhari government to deliver its electoral promises, voiced concern that such divisive insinuation was capable of distracting the government from implementing and achieving the Next Level Agenda if not checked. He said, “It becomes auspicious and expedient of us that the APC South West Forum, FCT chapter, should come on air particularly to allay the fear that has currently become palpable in our public space over time on the purported souring working relationship between President Buhari and his deputy, Prof. Osinbajo. “Since the inauguration of this government in 2015 , Change Agenda has not only brought about the meaningful redirection that has positively positioned our economy on the part of progress and sustainable development, but has also demonstrated a healthier understanding and a robust working relationship like we have never had before between our past president and his deputy. The president has always expressed confidence on his deputy. People should not instigate our leaders against themselves. There is no bad blood between the two.”  Northern Christians warn VP over political appointments Presidency says no rift as Buhari sacks Osinbajo’s aides Christian leaders should stand for the poor, good governance – Osinbajo
