The member representing Ado/Okpokwu/Ogbadigbo Federal Constituency of Benue State, Francis Agbo, has lamented that despite the contributions to the nation’s economy, his constituency was the most neglected in the whole country. Agbo who is the spokesperson of the Minority Caucus disclosed this when he received a delegation of his constituents from Ijigban/Ulayi/Ekile Communities of Ado Local Government Area led by Emmanuel Ogaba. He disclosed that, his constituents contribute a lot to the economy of Benue State and the nation especially in Agriculture, they remained the most neglected, in terms of infrastructure and employment in the state and federal civil service. According to him, his constituency has been grossly underdeveloped which turned his people into a laughing stock in Nigeria. “I want to use this medium to tell the world, how marginalised the Enone people are and particularly the people of Ulayi, Ekile and Ijigban. I agree with the leader of the delegation who just said that the Nigerian state has forgotten the Ulayi, Ekile and Ijigban Community. I cannot agree less! My people are still in darkness. “These communities are the only ones in the whole of Nigeria, without electricity, roads, water and development of any kind; there is no single person in this communities, employed in the Federal civil service, no officer in  the Nigerian military, Police , the Customs, Immigration, Fire Service, and the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps,”  he lamented.
