The governor-elect of Bayelsa State, Chief David Lyon, has said that the committee he inaugurated on Wednesday was not meant to probe outgoing Governor Seriake Dickson but to facilitate a transition from the incumbent to the incoming administration. Lyon, in a statement by his media aide, Chief Gift Ebiki, yesterday said the clarification became necessary following misconceptions in some quarters about the assignment of the committee. The governor-elect emphasised that the committee, chaired by a former acting governor, Chief Werinipre Seibarugu, was expected to ensure a hitch-free, peaceful and smooth transition. He said the terms of reference of the committee did not permit it to begin probing the outgoing government. “We are in transition and our actions and utterances are restricted to smooth transition. The APC transition committee will interface with a similar committee set up by the outgoing government. “It is in their own responsibility, not only just to find and identify failures of outgoing administration but also proffer possible solutions to tackle economic, security, development, infrastructure and several other areas that often put any administration in the negative,” he said.
