The ComeChop Initiative and the Chester Fries, on Christmas and Boxing Day visited the Internally Displaced Camps (IDP) camps where it fed over 12,127 women and children. The initiative which visited New Kuchingoro, Area 1 and Lugbe as well as Angwar Cement, Dape 1 and Dape 2 communities in Abuja, under the #Project20000, developed by the ComeChop Initiative, a Non-Profit Organisation founded with the primary vision of eradicating hunger in Nigeria. The co-founder of the initiative, Mr. Paul Obasi Smith, said many Nigerians are hungry, and something has to be done about it, especially that people across the world associate the Christmas with spreading the message of love, a period of celebration and sharing. He cited the 2019 Global Hunger Index, with Nigeria ranking 93rd out of 117, saying this calls for urgent actions to solve the problem. “I read a UNICEF report that mentioned that only 20 percent of the 2.5m hungry children in Nigeria get help. The government and international community need to intervene to come up with sustainable projects to eradicate this challenge,” Smith said. Another co-founder of the initiative, Mr. Sola Bakare, said that the issue of hunger is a looming crisis that if not tackled will become a calamity. Bakare said, “Almost every problem in Nigeria can be traced back to hunger and poverty and the reason why we have to tackle this now is because certain people have weaponized hunger and poverty and this is why issues like voter trading, book haram and corruption continue to rise. Nevertheless, today is all about the Gospel of Jesus and all about loving our neighbor.” WFP spends 95m dollars for food intervention in North-East Hunger: Children in Bauchi IDPs camp feed on onion leaves Yuletide: Huawei donates foods, clothes, other gifts to Abuja’s IDP camps
