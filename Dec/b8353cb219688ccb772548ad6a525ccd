The ministerial task team on free flow of traffic in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) has raided about 15 motor parks operating along roads in Kubwa town. The operation which started before 6am on Monday saw many transport operators attempting to withdraw their vehicles from areas where they used to load passengers for interstate journeys in the town in order to avoid the vehicle being impounded. It was gathered that the operation was coming after days of raids on roadside traders around NNPC Junction, and the newly commissioned Maitama Modern Market, Kubwa, where severe traffic build upÂ  has become a norm. There was also demolition of some shops on Saturday around the road that led to the NYSC camp, from the market. Reacting, the chairman of the ministerial team, Attah Ikharo, said all the transport operators in the town are going to be affected with the ban which he said was communicated to them some months ago. He said the roadside business operators around the affected areas are being advised to either relocate to Maitama or Kukwaba modern markets, just as those that are operating parks at roadside or residential areas, have the option to go to the transport terminal also provided at the Kukwaba market.
