A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo State, Asiwaju Rotimi Ajanaku, has urged monarchs and elders in Yorubaland to support the National Leader of party, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, for the 2023 presidential election. He described Tinubu as a relevant factor in actualizing Yoruba unity and agenda for 2023 general elections. Ajanaku, who stated this in a release he personally signed and made available to journalists in Ibadan on Sunday by his media aide, Prince Adebowale Adeoye, further described Tinubu as an indispensable catalyst to the actualization of Yoruba agenda in 2023 and beyond. “As Asiwaju Odo Oodua (Oodua Youths Leader), it becomes imperative that I speak on issues affecting South West states and Oodua agenda ahead of 2023 as well as unwarranted discussion on Tinubu’s presidential ambition, subsequent attacks on his person by some uninformed people and those planted by antagonists to draw the progress and advancement of the southwest region backward. 2023: Afenifere can't stop Yoruba man from becoming President – Salvador I joined APC to champion Tinubu’s 2023 project – Ex-PDP Org.
