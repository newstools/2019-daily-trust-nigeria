Air Peace on Thursday denied media report linking the airline to a seized aircraft in Atlanta, United State, saying the airline doesn’t have any aircraft in the US. A corporate communication executive of the airline, Stanley Olisa said linking the airline to a seized aircraft in US is mischievous. He said in a statement, “The attention of Air Peace airline has been drawn to a false report linking the airline to a seized aircraft in Atlanta, USA. The company does not have any aircraft  in the US. Linking Air peace to the aircraft that was seized in the US is the act of mischief makers locally who are bent on tarnishing the image of the airline and its owner. “We have since learnt that the actual owner of the aircraft appeared in court on Tuesday in the US but unfortunately, some people are still linking the aircraft to Air Peace.” Ethiopian Airlines crash sparks global safety concerns on 737 Max planes Air Peace to add Boeing planes, inaugurate flights to S/Africa, India AIB accuses Air Peace of not reporting serious accidents
