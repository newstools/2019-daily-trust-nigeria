The Accountant-General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris, has warned that university lecturers that are not on the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Integrated System will be sanctioned if they do not enrol on the IPPIS on or before Friday, December 6. In a statement yesterday, Ahmed said some vice chancellors of federal universities were yet to enrol on the IPPIS one week after the commencement of the exercise. “The passive response from the leadership of these universities appears to be an indirect demonstration of their unwillingness to key into this government policy designed to promote transparency and accountability in the government expenditure. “Those that are in this category are hereby advised to enrol on IPPIS on or before Friday, 6th, December, 2019, to enable us meet the deadline set by the Federal Government for the payroll of federal universities,” he said.
