A member of the Vigilante Group of Nigeria (VGN), Ekiti State Command, Mr Alabi Odunayo Solomon, 52, has been killed by some suspected robbers while at his duty post in the state. Information gathered revealed that the suspected killers had last Thursday night invaded a quarry site along the Ado/Akure road to steal some of the company’s property. A member of the vigilante group who escaped the robbery scene narrated that the robbers killed one of the three of them on duty.  He said the robbers shot Solomon, who was the leader of the vigilante team on security duty at the company, through the window, while they tied another one before stealing and carting away electric cables and other facilities from the quarry. Confirming the incident, the Commandant of the VGN, Ekiti command, Mr Akin Olounloni, said that Solomon had earlier called him to report that some cultists had threatened to kill him after he reprimanded them. The commandant noted that the police had arrested the suspected killers and the case had been transferred to the State Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), in Ado-Ekiti. Also, the SARS Commander in Ekiti, Mr Marcus Ogundola, confirmed that three suspects had been arrested in connection with the crime. “We have arrested three suspects but investigation is still ongoing. We cannot say for now whether they were the real perpetrators, but we are thoroughly digging into the killing,” he noted.
