Two women were yesterday arraigned before an Ikeja magistrate court, Lagos, for allegedly beating up a man, Mr Samuel Edeh, and stealing his phones worth N40,000. The defendants, Mrs Ejiro Johnson, 43, and Mrs Patience Samuel, 42, are facing a five-count charge. The police prosecutor, Chief Superintendent Akin Raji, alleged that Johnson and Samuel assaulted Edeh on December 9, 2019, at Mufutau Ope-Ifa Street, Oke-Odo, Lagos. Edeh told the court that the two women conspired to beat him up and inflicted on him injuries on his right eye, his left hand and left leg. A prosecution witness testified, “Edeh was on his way home on that fateful day in his car when he asked some children who were in the way to leave the road for him to reverse, but they replied by abusing him. He reported the children to their mother, but instead of the woman cautioning them, she, with the support of a female neighbour, beat Edeh up with a cane and plank.” The two women pleaded not guilty to the charge against them. The magistrate, Mrs O. A. Layinka, gave them bail in the sum of N300,000 each, with two sureties and adjourned the case till January 22, 2020 for trial.
