The Executive Director Finance and Chief Financial Officer of OES Energy Services, Mogaji Adegboyega Adegoke, has advised President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure proper monitoring of loans the federal government is collecting. He said he should ensure the loans are judiciously invested on Infrastructural development. The financial expert said nothing is wrong in borrowing, but pointed out that such loan should be channeled towards infrastructural development so as to provide more jobs and other social amenities for the citizens. Adegoke gave the advice while addressing journalists during an end-of -year party he organised for some of his associates, friends and families in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. He maintained that many Nigerians were against borrowing more money by the government due to the experiences of not spending loans judiciously. “There are instances you need to borrow to bail yourself out of problems. Because, there was a time we went on recession. Tactically, once your GDP growth is negative, two quarters consecutively, you are in recession. “And part of the means of getting out of recession is to spend yourself and start putting money in roads construction, infrastructure, and if you don’t have that money, you borrow the money. “So, I don’t have issue with borrowing money. I don’t have anything against borrowing so far as there are no leakages. When I say leakages, not that they are borrowing money and somebody will be diverting it. That is leakages. “But, when you borrow spend it to develop infrastructure and provide electricity. I can tell you that if you solve electricity problem in Nigeria, about 60 per cent of our problems would be solved,” he said.
