Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Mr Yekini Nabena has lauded the ruling of the Court of Appeal which reversed an earlier Federal High Court judgement that disqualified the deputy governorship-elect, Senator Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo, from participating in the Bayelsa State governorship election on November 16. Nabena, who spoke to journalists yesterday, shortly after the judgement in Abuja, thanked the people of the state for their support for the APC and its governor and deputy governor-elects despite what he called the PDP’s underhand tactics to steal their mandate and rubbish the Bayelsa governorship electioneering process. You can't blame army, police for PDP’s defeat, Nabena tells Dickson Nabena to Dickson: You can’t rig Bayelsa poll Bayelsa governorship: APC raises alarm over arms stockpiling
