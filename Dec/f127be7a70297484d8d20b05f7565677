Minister of the FCT Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, over the weekend toured areas prone to traffic gridlock within the FCT and commended the Ministerial Task Team on Traffic Management for easing traffic at the spots. Malam Bello, in company of the Executive Secretary of FCDA, Engr. Umar Gambo Jibrin and operatives involved with traffic management, last week visited the AYA-Nyanya section on the Abuja-Keffi road, Gwarimpa U-turn at the Outer Northern Expressway and Dutse Sokale road. The minister also visited the Gado Nasko and the NYSC roads in Kubwa  town where the task team succeeded in not only opening up  the road which hitherto  had been congested due to illegal street trading but also enabled a clean-up operation by the Abuja Environmental Protection Board. Speaking after the tour, Malam Bello said  members of the task team were selected because they exhibited a passion for work and had proven track record of competence. He further said a lot can be achieved if officers were focused. While expressing happiness with the support the Department of Road Traffic Services (DRTS) AEPB, FRSC and other agencies and departments involved in the task team had provided it, the FCT minister assured that with inter-departmental cooperation, “we can move mountains.”  FG: 25,000 made in Nigeria vehicles ready this year FG approves draft policy for Parks reform FG receives final draft of National Transport Policy
