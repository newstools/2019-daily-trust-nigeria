A non-governmental organisation, Partners West Africa Nigeria (PWAN), has called on the Lugbe community of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to always report every form of sexual gender-based violence in the community. Speaking yesterday in Lugbe, Abuja, during the sensitisation programme, project manager of the programme, Barr. Henry Anoliefo, said the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA) has provisions for punishment on anyone who committed such crime. He said sexual gender-based violence did not only affect the female gender but the male gender as well, adding that it was a crime that must be eradicated. “We feel that a lot of ladies are dying in silence; we came today to encourage them to come out and report the offence and not suffer on silence,” Anoliefo said. Part of aim of the visit, he also said, was also to enlighten people of the community about ACJA so that they will know their rights in the case of arrest and how they should go about it. He said it was important for people to know their rights and also well to protect that of others. He said the organisation will visit Kuje correctional centre and help inmates who are awaiting and those who do not have legal representation to give them lawyers to handle their case.
