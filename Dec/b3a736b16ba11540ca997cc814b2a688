The member representing Hadejia-Kafin, Hausa-Auyo Federal Constituency, Usman Ibrahim a.k.a Kanfani ((APC Jigawa), has condemned the campaign of calumny against him. His Special Assistant on Publicity, Ibrahim Yunusa, while reacting to a report that the lawmaker had not executed any project in the constituency since he was elected into office in Dutse, said representative Ibrahim had touched the lives of the downtrodden. He said this was different from his intervention in the provision of potable water provision, agriculture and socio-religious matters. He said his boss sank 600 solar powered and manual boreholes, provided the peasants farmers with irrigation generator sets as well as funds for free healthcare services for the his constituents. Yunusa said the attack was the handiwork of some detractors to smear the image of his principal, stressing that the records of achievement available in public domain are enough to support his hard work. He added that 200 communities benefitted from his overhead water tanks each. “In agriculture, he donated 400 irrigation water pumps to farmers. In the area of empowerment, 200 sewing machines, 600 motorcycles and 200 grinding machines were distributed. In healthcare provision, 60 were sponsored for eye treatment, while 300 female orphans were provided with dowries,” he added.
