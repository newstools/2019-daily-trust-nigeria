The Edo State Chapter of the APC, Anselm Ojezua, has accused former Governor of the state and suspended National Chairman of the APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, of lacking legitimacy, temperament and moral authority to lead the party. Ojezua, who spoke during a World Press Conference at the APC Secretariat in Airport Road, Benin City, called on Oshiomhole to resign from his position having been suspended by his ward and local government. He also accused the national chairman of the party of orchestrating the crisis rocking the party to discredit Governor Godwin Obaseki and the state party executive in order to have forcible regime change in the state. Responding, the suspended party secretary, Lawrence Okha, said the call for Oshiomhole’s resignation was laughable because it came from members of the Obaseki/Shaibu Solidarity Movement and not APC members. “Ojezua is the chairman of OSM and not APC. Col. Imuse is the authentic chairman of the APC and recognized by the NWC,” he said.
