Plateau State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Damishi Sango has resigned from his position following the recent crisis that rocked the party and corruption allegations against him. Speaking at a farewell press conference in Jos, the state capital, Sango said his deputy, Amos Gombi, will take over as acting chairman. He said: “You are all aware that since April this year, the state chapter of our great party has been rocked by a tsunami-like crisis that has threatened its very existence as one united political party. “This followed my purported suspension along with my deputy as chair and deputy, respectively, by some members the executive committee on trumped up allegations of mismanaging funds meant for the party’s logistics arrangements in the 2019 presidential election in the state. “Following the unfortunate incident, determined to resolve the crisis and get the chapter moving again, the national leadership of the party, led by Prince Uche Secondus, set a three-man committee under the chairmanship of Senator David Mark, to look into the said allegations and advice it accordingly. “ He said Secondus communicated that the Senator Mark committee did not find him guilty of any financial impropriety, “and so I was exonerated of all allegations against me. “Pursuant to my being exonerated, the group of 16 executive committee members should write to the NWC, withdrawing their allegations. Upon the withdrawal of the allegations, in consideration of the fact that there’s bad blood between me and most of my colleagues in the executive committee, particularly the group of 16, and to pave way for peace in the state chapter, I should step aside as chairman. “In line with provisions of the party’s constitution, my deputy, Hon. Amos Gombi, shall be acting chairman,” Sango said.
