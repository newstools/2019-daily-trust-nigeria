A 42-year-old member of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) died in a chase to stop a vehicle from picking a passenger. Our correspondent gathered that the deceased, identified simply as Jaloo by his fellow NURTW patrol team members, lost his life in a multiple motor accident involving three vehicles. Jaloo and his colleagues were said to be chasing, in their patrol vehicle, a driver who they considered had “unlawfully” picked a passenger along the road along the Ondo-Akure road, Ondo State, at about 12.10pm yesterday. Two other persons were said to have sustained serious injuries and were rushed to a hospital by officials of the Federal Road Safety Corps from Ondo town. The Unit Commander, Ondo Town Unit Command, Assistant Corps Commander Olanrewaju Adeyemi, said the accident involved a Mazda car with plate number TUN 84 AE, a Toyota Picnic car registration number BDR 152 XA and a Volkswagen bus RLE 736 AA conveying 13 passengers, comprising 11 males and two females.  2 killed, one injured in Abaji auto crash 6 injured as truck loses rear axle, tyres along Abuja-Keffi highway Big money, big trouble: The story of Nigeria’s multi-billion naira transport union
