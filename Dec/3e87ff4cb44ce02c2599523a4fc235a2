The All Progressives Congress (APC) has lauded President Muhammadu Buhari on the launch of the Open Treasury Portal (OTP), describing it as another groundbreaking initiative that will tackle public sector corruption and plug leakages in the public treasury. The APC National Publicity Secretary, Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, said in a release issued yesterday that the launch of OTP was another giant step in the pursuit of open governance, transparency, and anti-corruption fight promises the APC made to Nigerians. Issa-Onilu said the APC administration invited all who meant well for the country to support ongoing efforts at plugging revenue leakage, tackling graft and rebuilding the country. He said countries progressed when government and citizens put the interest of the nation above any other consideration be it political and other affiliations. “Those who want to do business with government should understand that henceforth, everything would be done in the open. Every Nigerian can now have access to every naira the government is making and every naira that the government is spending and on what it is being spent “In the fight against public sector corruption, the OTP complements other initiatives such as the administration’s full implementation of the Treasury Single Account (TSA) which has increased the level of accountability and transparency in the financial resources of the government; stoppage of budget padding, contrary to what we witnessed throughout the 16 years of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and pruning out thousands of ghost workers through stricter implementation of Integrated Personnel Payroll System (IPPIS). “To name a few of OTP’s requirements, all MDAs are to publish: daily reports of payments from N5m; monthly budget performance; quarterly financial statements; and annual financial statements prepared in compliance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). All the reports are to be published within stipulated deadlines on the OTP portal which will be open to and can be accessed by all,” the release added.
