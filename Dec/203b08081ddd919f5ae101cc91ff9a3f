Senator Philip Aduda, representing the FCT has felicitated with residents of the territory as they celebrate Christmas. Aduda, in a statement by head of his media team, Stephen Ajiya, urged the Christian faithful to use the period to reflect on the ministry of Jesus  Christ, which he said preaches love and support for one another. He called on leaders to work for the betterment of humanity as Jesus Christ did, by leaving the comfort of his father to come into the world to free humanity from all forms of bondage. According to him, the  birth of Jesus Christ, who is the saviour, was a moment to savour. “I am excited to share this moments with my constituents (the FCT residents) who have stood resiliently beside me all through the year, with prayers and moral support. And therefore wish the good people of FCT, a gloriously merry Christmas filled with love, joy and happiness,” he said. He enjoined Christians to exhibit the spirit that the season has brought which he said exemplified love, giving, and peaceful coexistence.
