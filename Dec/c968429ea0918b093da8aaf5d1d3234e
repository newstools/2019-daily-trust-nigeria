The Minister of Power, Engr.

In separate statements by the Minister’s spokesman, Aaron Artimas, which were also posted on the ministry’s Twitter handle, the minister said the actions were in continuation of the reorganisation and sanitation in the ministry. For the NBET, it said: “In view of this, the minister has also directed the Constitution of a 5-man investigative committee to look into the myriads of complaints against the MD/CEO (of NBET) with the view of restoring sanity in the management of the company. “Consequently, she is to handover to the most senior director in the organisation,” the statement noted. Commenting on the suspension of the REA boss, the statement said the suspension followed some apparent infractions in the Agency which prompted the indefinite suspension. Ogunbiyi, according to the statement, is to hand over to the next most senior officer in the Agency.
