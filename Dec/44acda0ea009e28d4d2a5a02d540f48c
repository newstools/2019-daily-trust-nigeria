Members and students of the International Organization of Tijaniyyah Brotherhood (IOTB) and the Tijaniyyah Muslim Students Association of Nigeria (TIMSAN) have been told not to rest on their oars until peace, sanity and spiritual upliftment dominates Nigeria. Chairman of IOTB, Prof. Abdullahi El-Okene, who stated this in Abuja yesterday at an international conference organized by IOTB and TIMSAN, described Nigeria as a precious gift and called on all members to stand up and ensure it is repaired. He said God has favoured Nigeria to have over 40 million Tijaniyyah adherents and called on members to pray and shower love to others, adding that they cannot positively impact on the society if they are not morally upright. Students from over 70 higher institutions across the country were in attendance at the conference, while various Islamic scholars such as Sheikh Muhammad-Mahy Cisse of Senegal, Habibou-Rasoul of the USA, Sheikh Tahir Usman Bauchi, Shaikh Sharif Ibrahim Saleh Alhussainy, Khalifa Ahmad Abulfathi, Shaikh Al-Khalifah Sharafdeen Ajara and others, addressed participants or sent messages that were read out at the event.
