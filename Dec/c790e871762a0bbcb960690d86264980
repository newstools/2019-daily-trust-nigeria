Keystone Bank Limited has rewarded 34 winners in its ‘Growbiz Account Save and Win’ promo with cash and consolation prizes in different parts of the country. The winners which were selected through a computerised and random process, were picked from the bank’s branches across the six geo-political zones, with members of National and Lagos Lottery Regulatory Commission in Nigeria in attendance, to ensure transparency and accountability. The lender had on August 5, 2019 launched the promo as part of its efforts aimed at expressing appreciation to its loyal customers whilst engendering a good savings culture in the country. The promo which was open to both new and existing customers of the bank and scheduled to run till November 30, 2019 requires customers to grow their Keystone Growbiz Account balance by N50, 000 and maintain it for 90 days to qualify for the raffle draw. In all, 9 customers won N100, 000 each, another 9 customers went home with N50, 000 each, while other consolation prizes of refrigerators, generators, standing fans and microwave ovens were given to other winners. Speaking at the event, Helen Nwelle, Head, MSME & Value Chain Management said: “MSMEs are significant contributors to the nation’s economy, hence they consistently require intermittent support to scale up their business, thrive and also continue to create jobs which would impact the nation’s GDP.” One of the winners, Nnaemeka Anthony (from the Northern region), who won N100, 000 thanked the bank for the gesture stressing that the cash would go a long way to supporting her business.
