One of the research centers of the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University (ATBU), Bauchi, the National Center for Petroleum Research and Development (NCPRD) of the Energy Commission of Nigeria (ECN) has organized the 2nd summit on research activities in Nigeria’s frontier basins. Organized in collaboration with NNPC, Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, and ATBU with the theme: Nigeria’s Frontier Basins: Vehicle for Reserve, the two-day summit, in Abuja, focused on how to grow petroleum oil and gas reserve base of Nigeria through research and development. The Vice Chancellor of ATBU, Prof. Abdulazeez Muhammad Ahmad, at the event, revealed that ATBU was part of the late 1990s exploration campaign in the Kolmani River-II of the Gongola Sub-basin of the North East Nigeria. He said though SNEPCo earlier reported a non-commercial gas discovery in Kolmani, ATBU independently studied another well Nasara-1 as a PhD research and indicated the presence of oil in the well sourced from lacustrine sediments. That finding, Prof. Ahmad said, earned the NUC’s best PhD award from all physical sciences from all Nigerian universities for the year 2006 as well as NMGS/Chevron best PhD award for the same year. ATBU, he added, is one of the specialized institutions of higher learning established in 1980 by the federal government to drive technological development and transfer of scientific knowledge for the socio economic development of Nigeria and humanity in general.
