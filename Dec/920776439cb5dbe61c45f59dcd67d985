Aircraft manufacturer, Boeing yesterday sacked its Chief Executive Officer, Dennis A. Muilenburg, following the prolonged crisis triggered by the Max 737 crashes which killed 346 people. The planes have been grounded since March 2019 and the moves to return the Max aircraft to the sky have even precipitated bigger crisis amidst growing disapproval from airlines. Also, the US congressmen, airlines, regulators and the victims’ families have faulted Boeing’s approach to resolving the multitudes of issues raised by the 737 Max crisis. Boeing said yesterday that David Calhoun, the chairman, would replace Muilenburg on Jan. 13. Until then Boeing’s chief financial officer, Greg Smith, will serve as interim chief executive. The board of Boeing arrived at the decision on Sunday and the embattled CE has stepped down immediately. In a statement posted on its website yesterday, Boeing said Calhoun will remain a member of the Board. In addition, Board member Lawrence W. Kellner will become non-executive Chairman of the Board effective immediately. “Under the Company’s new leadership, Boeing will operate with a renewed commitment to full transparency, including effective and proactive communication with the FAA, other global regulators and its customers,” Boeing said. “On behalf of the entire Board of Directors, I am pleased that Dave has agreed to lead Boeing at this critical juncture,” Mr. Kellner said. The incoming chief executive said, “I strongly believe in the future of Boeing and the 737 MAX. I am honored to lead this great company and the 150,000 dedicated employees who are working hard to create the future of aviation.” Ethiopian Airlines questions Boeing’s ‘aggressive’ software ‘Preliminary report on ET 737 Max crash out soon’ Air Peace to decide on Max 737 order after investigations
