A group, Association of Imo Patriots, has said that the credit for the current rating of Imo as the least corrupt state in Nigeria should go to immediate past governor Rochas Okorocha. A statement signed by the group’s spokesman, Mr  Emma Ezekwe, asked Governor Emeka Ihedioha to apologise to his predecessor for the millions of naira spent on “unnecessary panels” he set up to probe Okorocha. The group claimed that Ihedioha had continued on his agenda to discredit the Igbo nation in the guise of maligning Okorocha. “As non-partisan patriots from Imo State, we demand an immediate apology from Chief Ihedioha’s administration over their several lies against the Okorocha administration. Wobbly Start for Governor Ihedioha Ihedioha can probe me after May 29, not now,  says Okorocha Okorocha: Ihedioha can probe me after May 29, not now
