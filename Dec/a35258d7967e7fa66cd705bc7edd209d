Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Reconciliatory Committee in Oyo State, Bar. Lowo Obisesan, has said that over 5000 aggrieved members have rejoined the party. Obisesan said hosting state governors and state chairmen across the country by President Muhammadu Buhari showed that he didnâ€™t only send the committee to reconcile aggrieved members but also show qualities of a good leader. The committee, under the APC Reformer, which comprises of political appointees, former members of the state and federal houses of assembly, former commissioners, former Special Advisers, and other aides to the immediate past governor of the state, Senator Abiola Ajimobi and other faithful leaders of the party, urged all the leaders to drop their ambitions for the reconciliation to work. The group, at a well-attended meeting by the leaders of the party across the 33 local governments of the state, chaired by Barr. Obisesan, said the members in the state made a mistake in the past and were ready to correct them. At the meeting were representatives of a former governor of Oyo State, Otunba Adebayo Alao-Akala, those of a former leader of the Senate, Senator Teslim Folarin, former chief whip of the state house of assembly, Abiodun Adigun-Hammed, and a former chairman of Oyo East Local Government, Hon.
