The Senate on Saturday hailed the railway modernization in the country particularly the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge line which test-run has commenced. The Senate Committee on Land Transportation gave the commendation during an oversight visit to the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) and inspection of the 157-kilometer fast train. Managing Director of the NRC, Engr. Fidet Okhiria took the Committee on inspection of the ongoing project from Lagos up to Abeokuta in Ogun state. Daily Trust reports that the Federal Government had last week declared free train ride from Lagos to Ibadan which would last for the next four months. The committee which inspected the ongoing train stations however advised the contractor,  the China Civil Engineering and Construction Corporation (CCECC), to ensure transfer of knowledge and skills in the construction of railway projects across the country to enable Nigerians take over the system in the nearest future. Chairman of the Committee,  Senator Abdulfatai Buhari said, “We are very pleased because we have been to three stations, we are now here in Abeokuta station and we are told we have nine stations, so far we have been to five out of nine. “The intention is to get to Ibadan but the train is parading between Lagos and Ibadan carrying people everyday free of charge throughout this December and early part of January which is called test running.
