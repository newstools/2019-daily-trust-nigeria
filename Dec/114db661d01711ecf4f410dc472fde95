A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State, Charles Idahosa, has said that the party is dying under the National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. Idahosa, who said this while reacting to issues surrounding the crises rocking the party in the state, said he could not pretend the party was losing its grip on account of Oshiomhole’s leadership. He said the moral decision left for Oshiomhole to take at this moment was to resign in the interest of the survival of the party. According to him,  the party is losing its grip due to alleged overbearing attitude of the national chairman. He explained that Oshiomhole had been a very good trade union leader but lacked the temperament and the character to lead a political party. “The best we can do for himself is to tender his resignation so that the party can have peace because the way the party is going, it is going out of control,” he said. Idahosa dismissed Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu’s claim that he was among the founders of the APC and expressed optimism that Governor Godwin Obaseki would get the party’s ticket either through direct or indirect primaries.
