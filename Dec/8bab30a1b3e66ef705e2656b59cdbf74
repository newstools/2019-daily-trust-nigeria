A former Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Bode George, yesterday advised Oyo State Governor Engr. Seyi Makinde to rise above partisan divides and reconcile every son and daughter of the state. Reacting to last week’s Supreme Court verdict which affirmed the election of Makinde, George said, “Let me state emphatically that this is not the time to gloat or engage in petty celebration. This is the time to withdraw into a statesmanship caution.” He added that Makinde is a young man “who is full of developmental ideas and forward looking clarity and one resolved in selfless idealism and discerning  leadership.” George, who is the Atona Odua of Yorubaland, urged the governor “to remain resolute, stretching the hands of curative largeness across all the limits and bounds of Oyo State without a narrow restriction to partisan articulations.” In a statement, he said Makinde’s victory at the Supreme Court “should be a time of reflection and sobering acknowledgement of our joint brotherhood. The feud is over. The acrimony of the recent past must now be flung away. Rancour, chest beating triumphalism should be discarded. “The pacesetter state should now look forward with keen and self-assured vision. Everyone must come together with renewed zeal, with purposeful devotion and unifying determination. “Governor Makinde must rise above partisan divide and situate himself as the reconciliator, the balm that heals all wounds, the bond that rectifies all disruptions and the pacifier that corrects all perceived ills,” he added.
