Chief Owolabi Salis, the governorship candidate for Alliance for Democracy (AD) in Lagos State, has described the decision of the Supreme Court dismissing his case as a bondage decision. He said the decision was hurried, wondering how the Supreme Court justices could rule on 10 cases in a way. In a statement yesterday in reaction to the apex court’s verdict dismissing his petition, he said, “About 10 guber cases heard in a day and decision taken immediately on all the cases. The Alliance for Democracy case has about 50,000 pages talk less of other cases. It is like “don’t bother us, our heads are full, get the hell out of here politicians.” AD heads to Supreme Court, seeks nullification of Sanwo-Olu's election AD candidate heads to Supreme Court, seeks cancellation of Sanwo-Olu’s victory S/Court verdict: Cabal sabotaged judiciary — Atiku
