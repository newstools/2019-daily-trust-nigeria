A 39-year-old man, Amos Ekuma, on Saturday submitted himself to policemen in Ikorodu after allegedly killing his neighbour. Ekuna was alleged to have attacked his neighbour, who was described as a dry cleaner, with a rod during an argument. The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, (PPRO), Bala Elkana, who confirmed the incident, said that the suspect would likely be tried for murder. Elkana said that on Saturday December 14, 2019, at about 2pm, Ekuma, of No. 59, Ajipon Street, Ogijo, Ogun State, submitted himself to the police at Ikorodu. The PPRO said the suspect told the police that he was in his shop along Sabo road, by Kokoro Abu Ikorodu, on Friday at about 7pm when one dry cleaner beside his shop popularly known as Actor attacked him with an iron rod as a result of an argument that had ensued between them earlier in the day. Elkana quoted Ekuma as saying that although the matter was later resolved by neighbours, the dry cleaner came back to attack him. The suspect, according to the police, said he pushed Actor who fell down and was rushed to the Ikorodu General Hospital but died while on admission. “The corpse was deposited in the mortuary for autopsy. The suspect is placed in custody for investigation by homicide detectives from the State Criminal Investigation Department, Yaba,” Elkana added.   “I want justice,” mother of girl killed in Ikorodu by Taskforce policeman cries out Ex-convict in police net over hijack, robbery 8 more suspects arrested over killing of Bureau de Change operators
