Meanwhile, lawyers have explained the implication of the prolonged detention of Dasuki since 2015. Dasuki was charged with five-count charge of money laundering under Section 15 of Money Laundering Act and unlawful possession of firearms under Section 28 of the Firearms Act. The offences carry a punishment of five years imprisonment each. Reacting to this, Abdul Mahmud Esq., said when a defendant has spent some years in detention, the law presumes that he has served his term. In the case of Dasuki, he said the fact that he had been illegally detained for four years meant he had an actionable case against the federal government. In the same vein, Ajibola Jimoh Esq., said the law recognized the number of years a person was detained in arriving at its sentence if the person was convicted. “It means he will only be an ex-convict but he will no more stay in prison and he will be released having already served most of his term,” he said.
