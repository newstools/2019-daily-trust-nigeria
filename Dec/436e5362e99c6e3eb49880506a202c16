The transmission of Onchocerciasis also known as River Blindness has been halted in Plateau, Nasarawa and Kaduna states. National Coordinator, Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) of the Federal Ministry of Health, Dr Chukwuma Anyaike made the disclosure yesterday during the National Onchocerciasis Elimination Committee (NOEC)  meeting in Abuja. Onchocerciasis is a parasitic disease caused by small worms living in the body. It is transmitted by the bite of the black fly, the vector for River blindness. Symptoms of the disease include severe itching, hanging groin, thick and rough skin and blindness. Dr Anyaike said Nigeria had a significant burden of the disease with presence in 32 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Professor Betrand Nwoke, chairman of the committee said the meeting was organised to honour those who have contributed in ending the transmission of the disease in the three states. He said experts have been working towards the elimination of the disease in the last 20 years, adding that results from Kebbi, Zamfara,  Oyo and Bauchi states showed that the disease was at the verge of interruption in those states. He said interruption of the disease in the three states meant that six million Nigerians would no longer be given mectizan for treatment. He said the achievement was possible through  collaborative efforts of the Federal Ministry of Health, international partners like Carter Centre, Sigth Savers, UNICEF and state governments and individuals.
