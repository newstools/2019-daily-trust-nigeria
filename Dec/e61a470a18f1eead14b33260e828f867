The Nigerian Government has disclosed plans to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with the Russian Federation in January, 2020 towards the resuscitation of the moribund Ajaokuta Steel company in Kogi State. The Minister of Mines and Steel development, Architect Olamilekan Adegbite, disclosed this recently during a visit to the National Steel Raw Material and Exploitation Agency (NSRMEA) in Kaduna. He reiterated the commitment of the Federal Government towards bringing back on stream the steel company which has been closed down for several years. Architect Adegbite said the Russian Federation and Nigerian government are “going to do a government to government deal.” “The resuscitation is going to be funded by the Afrixim bank and the Russian export centre. “Discussions with the Russians who were the original ones that built the company in the Soviet Union is at advanced level, and a committee has been set up to kick start processes that will lead to the implementation of the MoU when finally signed,” he added. For resuscitation of the Ajoakuta steel company, the Minister said, “Required materials must be stocked in sufficient quantities and quality, local investors would be encouraged and we are exploring all possibilities because we do not want to import any of the materials from abroad for steel production.” “This agency, NSRMEA, is invaluable towards the resuscitation or development of Ajaokuta Steel company and as you all know, the President is making sure that we resuscitate the Ajaokuta Steel and make it come back on stream. Earlier in his address, the NSRMEA Director General, Engineer Umar Albarka Hassan, said the agency which is saddled with the responsibility of mining and exploration in the country is constrained by inadequate skills, inadequate project vehicles, modelling soft wares, lack of core shed as well as challenges of dilapidated offices.
