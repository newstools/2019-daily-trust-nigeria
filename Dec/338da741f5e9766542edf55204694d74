The supplementary election for Kogi West Senatorial District held yesterday across 53 polling units with low turnout and apathy among voters. Although, the election was largely peaceful, the turnout of voters in some polling units visited by Daily Trust on Sunday was low. Observers said the apathy might be as a result of the widespread violence recorded in the November 16 election in the state. Voting went peacefully at polling units in Lokoja and other areas of Kogi West, including Odolu in Kabba and Aiyetoro-Gbedde in Ijumu LGA. At Ward B Unit 001, Karaworo, near Pararanda in Lokoja, accreditation began as early as 8am, after which voting commenced. While voter turnout was impressive in the capital, there were reported cases of voter apathy in parts of the senatorial district. In Mopa Muro, many voters in the areas where the supplementary election was to hold did not turn out. The Kogi State Resident Electoral Commissioner, Professor James Apam, blamed the low turnout on poor mobilisation by political parties. Apam said instead of the political parties to embark on membership drive aimed at convincing their supporters on the need to come out and vote for them, they turned around to blame INEC. Some voters told our correspondent that the low turnout could be blamed on the fear of a repeat of the violence on November 16 election. Results trickling in as at press time showed that the APCâ€™s Smart Adeyemi was leading.
