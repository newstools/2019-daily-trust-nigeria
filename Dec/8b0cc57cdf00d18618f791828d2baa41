The 18-man commissioner-nominees’ list sent to Ogun State House of Assembly for screening and possible confirmation by Governor Dapo Abiodun has torn the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) apart in the state. Daily Trust reports that the list sent to the legislature last Thursday, nearly seven months after Abiodun assumed office, has raised dust over the alleged sidelining of some political blocs in the appointment. Some APC chieftains loyal to former Governor Olusegun Osoba yesterday rejected the nominees’ list, saying  it does not represent Abiodun’s  proclamation that “he will run all inclusive government in Ogun State.” The loyalists, under the aegis of “Osoba Political Family”, viewed the governor’s “all inclusive mantra as a ploy to specifically ease out the political bloc from the current administration.” The strongly worded statement issued by party chieftains said some individuals “who are conservatively greedy business men and hijackers of power” had succeeded in hijacking the soul of Abiodun-led administration. The statement was jointly signed by Otunba Ayo Martins, Alhaja Yemisi Ayinla, Mrs Toyin Usifo, Pastor Matthew Oladele, Mr Jelili Onayemi, Chief Labeth Abodunrin and 18 others. The group, however, called on the National Chairman of the APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and former Lagos Governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu,  to prevail on Abiodun to “do the needful and correct the imbalance perceived so far in Ogun State.” Abiodun's commissioner - nominees' list tears Ogun APC apart Ogun: Ripples over Abiodun’s ‘inclusive government’ Ogun Elections: Osinbajo, Osoba allay fears over insecurity
