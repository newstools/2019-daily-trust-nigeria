The newly appointed Commissioner for Education in Zamfara State, Alhaji Jamilu Aliyu Zannah has rejected his appointment as a member of the state executive council. He said the rejection was due to the inability of the state’s governor Bello Muhammad Matawalle to fulfill some of his campaign promises. Alhaji Zannah’s nomination was confirmed by the state assembly in absentia as he was in India for medical treatment. Alhaji Zannah, who made this known to journalists in Gusau after he arrived home India, was the Campaign Director of Governor Bello Muhammad Matawalle in the governorship election in the state. “I went for medical treatment in India…Up to the time I was discharged from the hospital in India, the executive governor had never called to know my condition,” he explained. Alhaji Zannah also cited a lack of consultation as one of the reasons why he took the decision. He said he was never consulted on any decision regarding political appointments made in the state. Meanwhile, the state Commissioner for Science and Technology, Alhaji Bilyaminu Shinkafi, has refuted media reports that he has resigned. Shinkafi who spoke to Daily Trust on Sunday, said the reports of his resignation as a member of the state executive council were baseless and ill-motivated, therefore he remained in his position as commissioner.
