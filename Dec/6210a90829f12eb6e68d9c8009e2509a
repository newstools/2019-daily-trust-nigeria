The Osun State coordinator of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) Mr Ayodele Adewale Adegoke, has paid a condolence visit to the family of a prospective corps member, Oluwatosin Jacob Fakayode, who died in a motor accident on his way to the orientation camp. Fakayode, an indigene of Iwo, Osun State, who graduated with Distinction in Mass Communication from the Federal Polytechnic Offa, Kwara State, died on Thursday November 28, 2019 alongside other prospective corps members in a ghastly motor accident on Mokwa road, Niger State, while on their way to the NYSC camp in Katsina State for the Batch C, Stream II, orientation programme. When Adegoke visited the parents of the late corps member in Iwo on behalf of the NYSC Director-General, Brigadier-General Shuaibu Ibrahim, he lamented that Fakayodeâ€™s death was a great loss not only to his family, but also to the nation. The parents expressed appreciation to the NYSC leadership for their support and prayed for the safety of other corps members, who would be embarking on journeys to their various destinations after the orientation course.
