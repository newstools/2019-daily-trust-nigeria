The Body of Senior Advocates of Nigeria yesterday asked President Muhammadu Buhari to set up a judicial commission of inquiry to determine the perpetrators of the reported invasion of the Federal High Court in Abuja on December 6. The body said the enquiry should be a public one and must at the same time unravel the sponsors and objectives of the perpetrators, when determined. They made this call yesterday at a special valedictory court session to mark the retirement of Justice Kumai Akaâ€™ahs from the Supreme Court after clocking 70 years. In its speech delivered by Onomigbo Okpoko, BoSAN warned that unless the truth was unravelled, Nigeria would lose respect and become an object of ridicule in the comity of nations.
