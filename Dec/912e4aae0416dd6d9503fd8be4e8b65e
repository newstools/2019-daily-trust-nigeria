A former Senate president, Senator Ibrahim Mantu, and  Senator Philip Tanimu Aduda representing the FCT, were among top politicians that paid their last respects to the late former chairman of Bwari Area Council, Peter Yohanna. Speaking during the funeral service of the deceased at Ushafa ECWA Church on Saturday, Mantu described the late Yohanna as a young, vibrant and committed leader who piloted the affairs of the council with the fear of God. He noted that the deceased was a loyal party member on the national executive council of the PDP who always stood firm and brought inputs towards the success of the party at the national level. “Besides, the late former chairman of Bwari was just like my son, apart from being a loyal party member of the national executive council of the PDP, he was a  committed young man who respected everyone he came across, even when he was chairman,” he said. Also speaking, Senator Aduda described the late former chairman as a committed young man who had remained steadfast in ensuring peace among the people of the council, saying his death was an experience that everyone must taste. Earlier in his sermon, Reverend Mamman Waguna, of ECWA Church Ushafa, said there was need for people to reflect on their deeds so that they can amend as they enter the New Year. Rev. Waguna also urged leaders not to allow worldly things to distract them from doing the right things for their people, adding that every soul must surely account for what he has done in the hereafter.
