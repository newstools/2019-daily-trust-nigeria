The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa State has warned the outgoing governor, Seriake Dickson, to stop raising tension, following the electoral defeat of his party’s candidate, Senator Douye Diri, by APC’s David Lyon in the November 16, 2019 governorship election. The State Publicity Secretary of the APC, Mr Doifie Buokoribo, in a statement issued yesterday in Yenagoa, advised Dickson to toe the path of democracy and rule of law by taking his grievances to the courts instead of trying to paint the state in bad light. Buokoribo said, “Diri has lost to the APC candidate and governor-elect, Chief Lyon, who won with over 70 per cent of the votes and defeated his opponent in six out of the eight local government areas of the state. “In the last few weeks, since the overwhelming victory of our candidate at the November 16 governorship election, Governor Dickson has inundated the state, and indeed the country, with wild allegations. “We, however, unequivocally state and also remind Dickson that the elections have been concluded and the governor-elect, Chief Lyon, is only waiting to be sworn into office as the next Governor of Bayelsa State. And for those who feel aggrieved, like Dickson, there are constitutionally prescribed processes open to them to follow in trying to redress their grievances. “The people of Bayelsa spoke on November 16 across political boundaries and the message was clear. Dickson must respect the voice of the people.” Our gov’ship candidate not a cultist, APC tackles Dickson Jonathan's kinsmen in Bayelsa dump PDP for APC Bayelsa Guber: Can Jonathan’s support for Diri tip the scales?
