ActionAid Nigeria (AAN) has called for immediate review of the recently announced government directive requiring Nigerians to produce their Tax Identification Numbers (TIN) before they can operate existing or open new accounts. The Country Director of ActionAid Nigeria (AAN) Ene Obi made the call on Tuesday in Abuja following the federal government’s announcement that effective from January 2020 Nigerians are required to produce their TIN or be barred from operating bank accounts. Obi was speaking at the National Tax Summit organised by AAN in collaboration with the Tax Justice and Governance Platform. According to her, the level of unemployment in the country is high and will be very difficult for students and unemployed Nigerians to generate a TIN. She urged that Nigerians who already have a Bank Verification Number (BVN) be allowed to harmonise it with their TIN. She further urged government to take up the idea for consultation and assess whether it is workable or not.
