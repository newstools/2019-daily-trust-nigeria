Detectives from the Inspector General of Police Team (IRT) have picked up 13 members of a cult gang over the gruesome murder of a 30-year old house wife, Abosede Adeyemi Iyanda. She was allegedly slaughtered by a gang of ritualists in Ogun State. Police said that the deceased was cornered by her ex-lover, while she was on her way home from work. The police said that they strongly believe that the deceased was allegedly hypnotized by her ex-lover before he abducted her. The police suspect that the deceased’s ex-lover was the mastermind of the murder. It was gathered that the 13 suspects were arrested following a distress call to the IGP by the victim’s husband, Adeyemi Iyanda, about the sudden disappearance of his wife. The victim, Abosede, according to the police was on her way home when she was cornered by one Segun Olaniyi and two others who took her to their shrine in Ogun State. While at their shrine, Segun allegedly invited two of his accomplices who took her to a river where she was drowned before they slaughtered her while her old boyfriend watched. Though about 13 suspected members of the gang have been arrested by IRT operatives led by Abba Kyari, a Deputy Commissioner of Police, eight others are said to be at large. Those arrested are being detained in the Lagos office of IRT.
