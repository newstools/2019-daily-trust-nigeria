A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State, Otunba Pat Kelly, has appealed to political appointees and other beneficiaries of the party to assist their less privileged fellow members. Kelly, who is the Secretary of the  Elders’ Caucus of the state chapter, made the appeal at Bolorunduro, headquarters of the Ondo East local government, when he disbursed to party members what he termed ‘Yuletide gifts’ to celebrate President Muhammadu Buhari 77th birthday anniversary. The party stalwart, who is a Governing Council member of the Nigerian Institute of Transport Technology (NITT), said that it was impossible for only the Ondo State governor, Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, to handle the needs of party members in all the wards. He said that complementing the efforts of Gov Akeredolu, particularly in units and wards, was a notable way to sustain members’ interest and support. He urged every beneficiary of the party, either on account of patronage or appointment, to support other members that were less privileged. He said, “It is imperative for beneficiaries to extend the gains of democracy to their members. I am a beneficiary of the APC and, therefore, I feel obliged to give back to the party in this form. “The culture of giving to your followers is a sure way to build a political party because people are happy with the party and will rededicate their commitment to it.” Kelly explained that besides appointments, some committed members of the party had enjoyed patronage in terms of contracts, saying those categories of people should also appreciate the party by supporting the less- favoured, from time to time. The APC scribe gave out various gift items, including cash, to over 250 selected members of the APC in the locality.
