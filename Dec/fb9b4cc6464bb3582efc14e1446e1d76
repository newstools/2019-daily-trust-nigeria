The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) yesterday sealed two petrol stations in Lokoja, the Kogi State capital for fraudulent product sales. The agency’s field office in Yenagoa also sealed the NNPC mega station and two others in the Bayelsa state capital for similar infraction. In Lokoja the affected stations sanctioned for shortchanging customers include Emmaliz Nig Ltd and Always Petroleum Ltd. Their product sales were short by 0.45 litres in every 10 litres sold, and 0.43 litres in every 10 litres sold respectively. Also sealed was Mohkah Gas Station for operating without a license. DPR Controller in the state, Engr Amos Jokodola, who led the surveillance team, said the exercise was to ensure that petrol station operators in the state don’t cheat consumers especially during the festive season. He also advised motorists not to engage in panic buying and storing of petrol products. In Yenagoa, the Assistant Chief Officer, Administration of the DPR office, Mr Oshodi Prince who led the inspection said De Arizona and Sobaz Ltd lacked basic equipment like extinguishers and sand bucket, needed before operation. Oshodi also warned against panic buying. “There are several imports of petroleum product already and in our various depots, we have a lot of petroleum product supplying to Yenagoa, so we have the belief that there will be no panic buying.” Why DPR closed 19 petrol stations in Yenagoa, Jos DPR seals 8 filling stations in Zamfara, 6 in Gombe DPR seals 5 filling stations in Kogi
