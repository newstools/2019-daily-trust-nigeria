A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr Osita Okechukwu, says the party’s National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, exposed his incapacity during the primaries for the 2019 general elections. Okechukwu, who said this while fielding questions from journalists in Abuja, stated that Oshiomhole constituted committees made up of his friends and well-wishers who were mainly from Edo State. He said some party leaders had now reasoned with some of them who were shouting like the bull in a china shop. “In the South-east, Edo man was chairman in Enugu, Chairman in Ebonyi, Ábíá, Secretary in Imo and we now asked ourselves, we contributed billions in terms of the fees, you can imagine my poor self, walking round friends and well-wishers, we contributed about 7. something million for me to pay in. “You raised only one panel per state and in political science, we were thought that primaries are a time for you to engage the party apparatchiks on gender and youth level. A panel in state – in House of Assembly for one state, a panel for House of Representatives, a panel for those who are running for Senate. In each state, let us say minimum of five.” Oshiomhole: 40 days of  ‘combative’ leadership Oshiomhole vs Obaseki: Inside feud tearing APC apart Election aftermath: Oshiomhole in fresh trouble
