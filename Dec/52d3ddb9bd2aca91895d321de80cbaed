The Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency yesterday sealed off the premises of Quilox Night Club, Victoria Island, while the club’s owner, Shina Peller, was also arrested by the Lagos State police command. Quilox, a popular entertainment centre owned by a member of the House of Representatives, Shina Peller, and patronised by the wealthy, was sealed allegedly for noise pollution and creating traffic congestion following a 36-hour party organised by the club. Peller, who represents the Iseyin/Itesiwaju/Kajola/Iwajowa Federal Constituency at the National Assembly, was arrested while allegedly attempting to effect the bail of some customers of the club who had been arrested for allegedly parking on the road during the 36-hour show at the club. A statement yesterday by the Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, accused the club of obstructing traffic by its activities. Elkana said the police towed three vehicles of Quilox customers on yesterday for causing gridlock. Bala also claimed that Peller mobilised thugs, invaded the Maroko police station and forcefully removed the vehicles. “This Honourable mobilised over 50 thugs to attack the Maroko police station to move those vehicles out. We had to send reinforcement from neighbouring stations before they were able to curtail the situation. That was how he was arrested with five of the thugs, while others escaped. We had to exercise a lot of restraint. “The Honourable is the owner of that club and his customers are fond of parking on the road and blocking the road. If you want to pass that place, you will have tough times. Up till 9am, the club was still on. They refused to remove their vehicles and Lagosians were seriously disturbed. Even Mr Governor was affected this morning. He had to manoeuvre his way through it,” he said.
