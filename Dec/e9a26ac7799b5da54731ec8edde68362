Abdullahi Umar Farouk, a senior legislative aide to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has said that APC National Leader Bola Ahmed Tinubu should succeed President Muhammadu Buhari come 2023 in recognition of his contribution to the development of the country’s democracy. Farouk, who is a three-time member of the House of Representatives from Kebbi State, stated this at the inauguration of the national executive committee of the Tinubu Media Team, TMT2023, on Wednesday at Amana Suites, Abuja. He said Tinubu has proven himself to be a good leader for the fact that he transformed Lagos State to the best city in Africa when he was governor. He said that was an indication that he had capacity to continue the ongoing transformation of President Buhari. The legislative aide added that Tinubu has not only contributed to Lagos State but to the entire country, as he stood firm to secure power from the military. On his part, the national coordinator of TMT 2023, Muhammad Bello Doka, while speaking on whether Tinubu is aware of the movement or not, he said: “He is not aware and that is why we are signing the petition. He will be aware very soon and we will not accept no for an answer. He will contest and will make Nigeria great.” Why Tinubu attacks me – Saraki Between Saraki, Tinubu: Who laughs last?
