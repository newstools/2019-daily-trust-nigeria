The Mambilla Beverages Nigeria Limited, a subsidiary of the Taraba Investment and Properties Limited (TRIP) has unveiled Highland Tea and Green Tea, launching it into the Lagos market. It is one of the 25 moribund subsidiaries of TRIP that was revived by Governor Darius Dickson Ishaku. The governor who unveiled the Highland Tea in Lagos yesterday said the Highland Tea and Highland Green Tea are 100 percent made in Nigeria. According to him, Lagos is the largest market in West Africa, stressing that the launch will boost the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of Taraba state. “So our idea is to bring our Highland Tea from Taraba to Lagos where the large market is available so that we can expose it to Nigerians in the Southern part of the country. After the acceptability here in Lagos, we will then think of other West African countries. We would export but we must first satisfy the home demand,” he said. The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of TRIP, Mr. Iliya Ezekiel said the restriction placed on importation of tea into Nigeria serves as a great opportunity for expansion. He also said the Company has generated over 3,000 employments and is geared towards hiring more as production and revenue increases.
