The Civil Society Groups for Peace, Sustainable Security and National Development has petitioned the Speaker of the House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila over call  for change in government through violence rather than through the ballot. Convener of the group, Comrade Adamu Matazu, who spoke yesterday, said those who lost out in the last general elections were hell-bent on promoting destabilisation of the government. He said they planned to do this through a well-orchestrated campaign that promoted hate along ethnic and religious fault lines to torpedo a democratically elected government via unconstitutional means. He called on opposition elements to seek governance through the ballot and not orchestrated violence to overthrow a democratically enthroned government. Comrade Matazu appealed to the National Assembly to grant more powers to the security agencies through new bills and constitutional amendments to curtail all imagined threats to national security. The petition partly read, “we are using this medium to pass a vote of confidence on Muhammad Buhari led administration for its successes in the war against terrorists, economic saboteurs, bandits and other security threats across the length and breadth of Nigeria. “That we call on our eminent members of the bar and bench to always put the national interest over and above any other considerations, and never to succumb to blackmail and propaganda churn out by the enemies of this nation.” Shun thuggery, ballot box snatching, FCT youth urged Presidential/NASS polls: Coalition of political parties rejects Zamfara results COE SUG election erupts into tribal violence
