Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State said yesterday that his victory at the Supreme Court amounted to truth eventually prevailing in the state. Makinde, while speaking with newsmen at the Ibadan Airport on his arrival from Abuja, following the Supreme Court judgment and also while addressing a crowd of supporters at the Government Secretariat, Agodi, Ibadan, said that the decision of the apex court to validate his victory in the March 9, 2019 governorship election was an opportunity to continue to develop the state. The governor, who assured the people that his government would develop the state in such a way that everyone would benefit in one way or the other, called on politicians not to fight themselves over benefits from government. A statement signed by the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Makinde, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, said the governor equally appreciated the judiciary for standing firm by the truth. He also appreciated the people of the state, Justices of the Supreme Court and especially Justice Adumein of the Court of Appeal, who gave a minority judgment that tallied with the decision of the Election Petition Tribunal, which had earlier upheld his election for standing by the truth. He said those who challenged the result of the March 9, 2019 election in the state, which the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) won by wide margin, were peddlers of lies. ...My mandate as Oyo gov remains intact — Makinde Appeal Court judgement: Oyo people’s mandate remains intact – Makinde S/Court: APC alleges Makinde, PDP plan to stampede judiciary
