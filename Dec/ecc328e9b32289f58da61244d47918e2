The FCT chapter of the Cotton Producers and Merchants Association of Nigeria (CPAMAN) has said it is set to join the league of cotton producers in the country. The FCT chapter chairman of CPAMAN, Alhaji Muftau Mohammed Munir, while speaking with newsmen in Gwagwalada yesterday, said the association’s decision to join the league of cotton producers was after the farmers land has been identified to be good for cotton farming. He said the association was already collaborating with the six area councils and the FCT Agricultural And Rural Development Project (ARDP) towards achieving the move. According to him, the association’s move was aimed at complementing the present administration effort in reviving the textile industry in the country. The chairman therefore called on members of the association to ensure they reach out to other farmers in their various communities about the importance of cotton farming.
