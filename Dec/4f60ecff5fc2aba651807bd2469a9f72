Justice Aneke adjourned till December 17, to rule on the bail application filed on his behalf by his lawyer, Eubena Anedu. The prosecuting counsel for the EFCC, Uduak Kufre, did not oppose the bail application but urged the judge to impose conditions that would ensure that the defendant attend the trial.
