President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated governors Abdullahi Ganduje, Kano State and Abdullahi Sule, Nasarawa State on their 70th and 60th birthdays respectively. President Buhari described Governor Ganduje as “a skilled politician, a party builder and a man who works for the success of our party.” The president, while celebrating Ganduje on his 70th birthday anniversary, said “the Kano State governor is one of the most patient and calculable politicians I have ever met in my life.” According to Buhari, “Ganduje is also a committed party man who has worked tirelessly for its success.” The president, in a statement yesterday by his media aide, Garba Shehu, explained that “Governor Ganduje has every reason to give gratitude to God for living to the ripe age of 70 in good health.” He also congratulated Ganduje for emerging as the Best Performing APC Governor which was awarded by the APC Governors Forum. In another statement yesterday, President Buhari, who congratulated Governor Sule of Nasarawa State on his 60th birthday, urged him to make good governance his priority in order to leave a lasting and favourable legacy. President Buhari said: “Life is the most invaluable gift from God and we should use our birthday to thank our creator and reflect on life, with humility.” The president, who wished the governor “many more years and good health,” advised him “not to rest on his oars because the task of fulfilling campaign promises is even greater than the campaign efforts.” “I urge you to make good governance your watchword because your good performance will be the yardstick by which your tenure will be judged for years to come. I wish you happy birthday and more prosperous years ahead,” President Buhari added.
