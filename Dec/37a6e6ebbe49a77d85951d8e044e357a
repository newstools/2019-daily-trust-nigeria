Two former governors of Sokoto State, Attahiru Dalhatu Bafarawa and Senator Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko, engaged in a war of words on Monday at the Sultan Abubakar III International Airport, Sokoto. Wamakko deputised Bafarawa for almost eight years before he voluntarily resigned to avoid impeachment. He later succeeded Bafarawa after defeating his anointed candidate, Alhaji Muhammadu Maigari Dingyadi, the incumbent Minister of Police Affairs, in the 2007 governorship election in the state. Bafarawa was said to have been irked by the recent statement made by Wamakko who termed him as a seasonal migrant to Sokoto, a reason why his predecessor was said to have shunned Wamakko who stood to greet him at the VIP lodge of the Airport on his arrival. “You said I am a seasonal visitor to Sokoto. Why are you greeting me? I know my father and grandfather were born and died here. I can even show you their graves. Can you show me the grave of your grandfather?,” he allegedly asked Wamakko. Wamakko was said to have refused to respond to Bafarawa. But another account said he stood by his statement that Bafarawa is Danchirani (a seasonal migrant) in Sokoto. “I don’t want to know where your father and grandfather are buried. All I know is that you are a seasonal migrant in Sokoto, that is all,” Wamakko was quoted to have said. “There are other people whose parents and grandparents have been buried here, but you called them seasonal migrants as well. So, just go and face your businesses,” he allegedly told Bafarawa. The duo, however, boarded the same flight to Abuja.
