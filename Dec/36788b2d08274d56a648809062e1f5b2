The Ondo State government has scaled up the capacity of a group of health professionals called medicine handlers at the State Contributory Health Scheme to train health officers drawn from the 18 local government areas of the state. At the Train the Trainers programme, which took place in Akure, the state capital, at the capital, the Commissioner for Health, Dr Wahab Adegbenro, expressed his expectation that with the coming of the Contributory Health Scheme aimed at achieving universal health coverage, there would be an upsurge in health facilities, hence the need to scale up the capacity of health workers for better service delivery. Dr Adegbenro said any error in the medical chain could endanger the life of the patient, a possibility he said the government was guarding against. The Health Commissioner added that customer satisfaction was the driving force of the Ondo State Contributory Health Scheme, and that the government would work hard to ensure the state achieves its Universal Health Coverage programme. The Executive Secretary, Ondo State Primary Healthcare Development Agency,Â  Dr Francis Akanbiemu, opined that medical services were incomplete without essential drug management. Dr Akanbiemu disclosed that certain gaps were noticed in drug management, hence the need to bridge the gap by training the critical mass of professionals that would train others.
