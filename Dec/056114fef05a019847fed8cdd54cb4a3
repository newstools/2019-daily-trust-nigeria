President Muhammadu Buhari has voiced sadness and shock over the passing of Senator Benjamin Uwajumogu, representing Imo North Senatorial District. The presidential media aide, Garba Shehu, in a release issued yesterday, said the president, who commiserated with the family of the late distinguished senator, the leadership and members of the National Assembly, and the government and people of Imo State on the “tragic transition”. President Buhari, who prayed for divine comfort for all who mourned, also asked God to grant rest to the soul of the senator. He said as a politician and community leader, Sen. Uwajumogu dedicated his life to service, which eminently earned him the trust of the people of Okigwe zone in Imo State, who elected him to represent them first, in the State House of Assembly, where he served as Speaker, and later, in the Senate. The president said from the torrent of tributes that had greeted his “unfortunate demise”, it was clear that Sen. Uwajumogu served his constituency and fatherland well.
