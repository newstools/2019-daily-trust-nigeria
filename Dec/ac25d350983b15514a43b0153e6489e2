Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has linked his absence at the 2019 Anti-Corruption Defender Award to the incident that greeted the resumed trial of the convener of #RevolutionNow, Mr Omoyele Sowore. Osinbajo, in a letter dated December 8, 2019, and addressed to the organisers of the award, also attributed his absence to his international meeting in Abu Dhabi under the auspices of the government of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The letter released yesterday by his spokesman, Laolu Akande, read, “I am extremely grateful for the recognition and award of the “Integrity Specialty of the Wole Soyinka Centre for Investigative Journalism’s Anti-corruption Defender Award of 2019’’ to me. “The award, I note, is for our Justice reform efforts in Lagos State. I accepted the award with pride on behalf of the excellent Justice Sector team we had. “However, two reasons explain my absence. First, is that I am currently in Abu Dhabi for an international meeting under the auspices of the government of the UAE where I am the keynote speaker. “Second, in view of the developments on Friday in the Sowore case, I think it would be insensitive and inappropriate to attend the ceremony. “Please accept my heartfelt apologies and extend the same to the other members of the organizing team. God bless you.” Soyinka Centre postpones Integrity Award on Osinbajo over protests Eleven feelings on PMB’s return Eleven feelings on PMB’s return
