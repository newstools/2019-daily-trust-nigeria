Property worth millions of naira was destroyed yesterday in an inferno that occurred at the popular Owode-Onirin market in Ikorodu, Lagos. Approximately 30 shops were damaged in the incident, which was said to have emanated from one of the shops within the market. According to investigations, the fire started from the metal segment of the market. The swift response of the state emergency management agency (LASEMA) was understood to have curtailed the fire from further spread. Sources at the scene of the incident said the market had not enjoyed electricity supply since 2017 and so the fire could not have been as a result of power surge. LASEMA spokesman, Nosa Okunbor, said no lives were lost but valuables worth millions of naira were destroyed. Okunbor said, “Approximately about 30 shops were damaged. The enumerating exercise would be done when the fire is totally extinguished.” Goods worth millions of naira destroyed in Lagos fire incidents Goods worth millions of naira destroyed as fire razes Balogun market Fire razes Abuja arts village, Onitsha drugs market, Lagos fair complex
