A former Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) House of Assembly aspirant for Jaba state constituency, Larai Ishaku, has resigned her membership of the party to join the APC.
Ishaku, who led a group on a courtesy visit to the Council Chairman of Jaba, Benjamin Jok, said Governor Nasir el-Rufai had brought great changes to Jaba.
She said, ‘I am with the leadership of Governor el-Rufai because of the development he has brought to Jaba Local Government. The last time we had a government project was in 1999 and it was a two-block classroom. In 2007, I went to SUBEB with a letter requesting for a block of classrooms, it was awarded and completed in 2018. Surprisingly, four blocks of classrooms were built and well furnished.”
She also said that smiles were put in the faces of the people of Kura this year as it was the first time they witnessed power supply.
According to her, “it is only someone who does not wish well for his people that will not laud this administration in Kaduna. I have followers across the seven local government areas in the state, especially in Jaba. We are waiting for you to officially receive us into the APC family.”
Jaba LGA chairman, Benjamin Jok, who received the group, said the party has a place for everyone who wishes to join.
Jok said Jaba had benefited greatly from the present administration. ‘Mama Taraba’: Another governorship ambition scuttled? El-Rufai re-elected Governor of Kaduna State – INEC Men who want to unseat el-Rufai
