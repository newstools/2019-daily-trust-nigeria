The Edo State House of Assembly has declared vacant the seats of 12 members-elect who were yet to be sworn in following the controversies trailing the inauguration of the parliament. The house also declared the seats of Mr Uyi Ekhosuehi and Mr Henry Okaka, representing  Oredo East and Owan East respectively, who didn’t meet mandatory sitting requirement as vacant. The two members had not attended plenary since the inauguration of the house  on  June 17. The Speaker, Francis Okiye, while declaring the seats vacant during plenary yesterday, said the 12 members-elect defiantly refused to come and process the necessary documentation as part of the condition for their inauguration. He said: “12 out of the 24 members-elect who completed their screening and documentation process were inaugurated on June 17, but  two of them have refused to discharge their legislative duties. They have refused to represent their constituents in the House, invariably denying their constituents effective representation.” He said the house was declaring the seats of the 12 members-elect vacant in accordance with Section 109 Sub-section 1F of the constitution. The 12 members-elect are Vincent Uwadiae Ovia North-East 2 constituency; Ugiagbe Dumez  Ovia North-East 1; Washington Osifo Uhunmwode, Michael Ohio-Ezomo  Owan West constituencies, Victor Edoror  Esan Central, Kingsley Ugabi  Etsako East.
