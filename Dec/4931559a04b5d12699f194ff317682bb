President Muhammadu Buhari’s patience and patriotism, which have been his trademark since assuming office, are desirable qualities for good leadership, the chairman of Daura Emirate Development Forum, Muhammad Sani Kallah, has said. Kallah in a statement issued to newsmen, said President Buhari meant well for the nation and needed the support of all well-meaning Nigerians by rallying round his administration. According to him, the successful fight against terrorism and corruption is a clear testimony to the administration. “His efforts to make our country self-sufficient in food production, and improve on revenue generation deserve commendation and support from all Nigerians. “We, therefore, call on all Nigerians, especially our youths, to rally round him and refuse to be deceived by enemies of this country who do not see anything good in whatever he does. “Our youths will be the greatest beneficiaries of all the sacrifices he has been making to put this country on course,” the statement also read. While felicitating with the president on his 77th birthday, Kallah said “you have remained a thing of pride and we will always be by your side come rain come sunshine. “It is a thing of pride to have somebody of your unique personalities coming from among them. “Like your Senior Special Adviser Femi Adesina said, you are not here to take anything from Nigerians, but you are here to give them everything,” it added.‎ I''ll keep doing my best – Buhari I’ll keep doing my best for Nigeria – Buhari Buhari arrives Daura as crowd throngs home
