A self-acclaimed pastor, Clement Oni, has been arrested over his alleged involvement in pipeline vandalism in the Isheri Osun area of Lagos. Oni’s arrest followed the recent explosion of a pipeline owned by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) at the Gloryland Estate, Isheri Olofin, along the Isheri-Igando-LASU expressway, which claimed the lives of two persons, while many others were injured. Investigation on the matter by a police team headed by the Divisional Police Officer, Ipaja Division, Tokunbo Abaniwonda, led to Oni, who claimed to be the head of a branch of a white garment church in the area, as one of the suspects engaged in siphoning fuel from a ruptured pipe in the area. A police source said an intelligence report prompted Abaniwonda to lead operatives to his Oni’s church located at Imole Ayo, Peace Estate, Baruwa-Ipaja, Lagos State. His alleged bunkering activity was understood to have been exposed through concealed drums and gallons of inflammable products carefully buried inside sand in the church premises. The police source said Oni and his accomplices would be arraigned in court when investigation is concluded.
