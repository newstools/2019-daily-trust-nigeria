An Ogba, Lagos, chief magistrate court, has ordered the remand of a 56-year-old man in a correctional centre for sexually assaulting his neighbour’s 17-year-old daughter. The accused person, Ayoola Sunday, was alleged to have been caught while making love with the teenager, with whom he was said to have been in a sexual relationship since 2016 when she was barely 14 years old. The police said that the incident happened at Ifeoluwa Street, Alapere, Lagos. The police prosecutor, Christopher John, told the court that Sunday warned the girl not to reveal their sex secret to anyone, with a threat she would die. John said, “The accused was caught red-handed while in the act by neighbours, who reported the matter to the girl’s parents. She admitted it when her parents confronted her. She told her parents that the accused has been engaging her sexually since 2016. “The matter was reported to the police and he was arrested. Sunday was later transferred to the Gender Section of the police command,” the prosecutor said. The prosecutor asked the court to refer the matter to the Lagos State Department of Public Prosecution for legal advice. The magistrate, Mr P. E. Nwaka, ordered Sunday to be remanded in correctional centre without an option of bail. The court directed the prosecutor to duplicate the file and send it to the DPP for advice.
