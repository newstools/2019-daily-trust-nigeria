A renowned labour leader, Comrade Issa Aremu, has faulted the former presidential candidate and convener of #RevolutionNow, Omoyele Sowore, for flouting the rule of law. He spoke in Kaduna State during a meeting in commemoration of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities (IDPD) organised by the National Union of Textile Garment and Tailoring Workers of Nigeria (NUTGTWN). Comrade Aremu, who is the NUTGTWN General Secretary, argued that obeying the rule of law is a two-way traffic. He said government and citizens must obey court orders to have sane community. He argued that the call for immediate revolution is unacceptable because the only way to change a government is through democratic process. Aremu said: “He contested election under a democratic government. Now, he is calling for forceful removal of the same government. “If he was not lucky in the last election, he should wait for another time. I also contested in the election and was not successful. But we are not going to call for revolution now because it is undemocratic. “So, he should obey the rule of law by doing what is acceptable in the law.” Issa Aremu mourns ex-leader Aremu, Ajaero embarrassment to labour movement, NLC says We must sack professional politicians – Isa Aremu
