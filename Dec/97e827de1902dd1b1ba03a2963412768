A forum of Non-National Working Committee (NWC) of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to consider them among other loyal members for appointment into the boards of agencies and parastatals. The forum, in a communique signed by its chairman Nelson Alapa and Secretary Omolayo Akinotola, after it meeting in Abuja on Tuesday, advised all the warring parties to give peace a chance. The National Executive Council (NEC) members also called on Comrade Adams Oshiomhole-led NWC to “review critically various suspensions and other administrative actions which have generated crises with a view of bringing all concerned to a round -table for harmonious resolution of such issues towards having a stronger party that can stand the test of time. “The Presidency is further being enjoined to ensure that Non-NWC members, party officials, nominees/committed Party members generated from the States are fixed into Federal Boards, Agencies and Commissions within shortest time possible. “Consequently, we appeal to all party leaders and stakeholders to sheath their swords majorly to allow President Mohammed Buhari and his team concentrate on the pressing National issues and policies that would promote peace, harmony, economic growth, improved security and solid foundation laying for the Next Level agenda for our dear country-Nigeria.” The forum, which appealed to all the concerned parties to put their differences behind them and move the party forward, pleaded “with the general public particularly the teeming supporters of APC to continue giving our President and the Party all needed embracement/ supports in this trying period until the desired stability and Nigeria of our dream is actualized.” Why we gave Oshiomhole 10 days to address our concerns - APC state chairmen ‘Oshiomhole usurping powers of NEC’ APC forum wants those against tenure extension punished
