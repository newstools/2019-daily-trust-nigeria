The sacked Kwara State House of Assembly member, representing Ilorin South Constituency, Honourable Abdulazeez Elewu, has sued the Independent National Electoral Commission and Speaker among others. Elewu approached the Federal High Court, Ilorin for determination of legality of the ruling of the Court of Appeal, which ordered the INEC to withdraw his Certificate of Return and issue a new one to the 2nd runner up in the March 9, 2019 State Assembly election, Mr Abdulraheem Agboola, of the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party (PDP). In an originating summon, with suit number FHC/IL/CS/157/2019, he joined the PDP candidate, Agboola, the INEC, the Speaker, Kwara State House of Assembly, Salihu Yakubu Danladi and the Clerk of Kwara state Assembly, Hajia Halima Jumai Kperogi as defendants. He prayed for a Court Order restraining the speaker and the clerk from admitting, recognizing, swearing in or inaugurating the PDP candidate as elected representative of Ilorin South State Constituency at the Kwara state House of Assembly. He equally prayed for a Court Order directing the speaker and clerk to continue to recognize, treat and deal with him as the elected representative of Ilorin South State Constituency in the 9th House of Assembly.
