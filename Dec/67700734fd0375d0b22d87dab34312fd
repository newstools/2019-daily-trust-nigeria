The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has released economic outlook for 2020, projecting high cost of doing business in Nigeria. The Director General of LCCI, Muda Yusuf in his 2019 economic review and outlook for 2020 identified infrastructural challenges such as erratic power supply, congestions at ports, inefficient road and railway system combined with the multiplicity of levies, inconsistency in government policies and excessive regulations as constraints that may continue to hinder ease of doing business in 2020. Though, he noted that while Nigeria may record improvement on the Ease of Doing Business Ranking as a result of some recent policy measures, realities on ground will continue to differ if the challenges highlighted are not properly addressed. According to him, performance of trade sector in 2020 will be shaped by the direction of government policies. “In our opinion, continued protectionist measures of government will most likely limit growth in 2020. Elsewhere, the level of the country’s engagement in Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) scheduled to kick-off July 1, 2020, will also impact the performance of trade sector,” He said: “We believe government will maintain its protectionist economic policies in 2020. While protectionist policies might help local industries stay afloat albeit it makes them remain less competitive to their foreign counterparts. It is probable that government will leave the land borders shut till it gets the desired level of commitment from neighbouring countries.” He however noted that the economy will continue to feel the heat of the policy action in 2020 in terms of higher food prices due to supply shortages; while reiterating that effective border policing, not shutting the borders, is a better approach to curtail smuggling.
