The former Managing Director of Media Trust Limited, Alhaji Isiaq Ajibola, has been appointed  the ‘Akogun Shaba’ of Ife Olukotun in South East Yagba Local Government Area of Kogi State. The appointment was announced yesterday by the Olukotun of Ife-Olukotun, Alhaji Oba Shuaibu Aiyegbajeje Mohammed, a first class traditional ruler in  Kogi State and the chairman in council. Traditionally, the position of ‘Akogun Shaba’ is recognised as the second in command to the Oba, whose jurisdiction covers the entire town and is a highly revered position in the community. Ajibola, a frontline community leader, is the grandson of the first graded Olukotun of Ife- Olukotun Oba Ajibola Asejogba I, who died in 1928. Reacting, Ogamode Oluwayomi David Atte, the Ohomi (prime minister) of Gabu Kingdom, said: “My stomach is very sweet indeed on hearing about your appointment to the post of Akogun Shaba of Ife Olukotun. “The Oba in Council has made a most significant decision by this appointment. You have impressed me as a serious but cool-headed young man who has matured in mind far beyond his age. I have watched you closely and can say with total honesty that  you are a decent, hardworking well focused, extremely level-headed, humble, self effacing and  patriotic young man who has learnt to wash his hands and able to eat with the elders. I totally applaud the Ife Olukotun Oba in Council for making the excellent choice of a well deserving young man to this post. I do not have the slightest doubt in my mind that you will excel. God has prepared you for it and He will grant you the strength and wisdom to do exploits for your people. Mo ki gbogbo omo Ife Olukotun ku ori ‘re because they are about to witness a great change for the better through you. “I congratulate you with my whole heart and pray that the Lord God would support, sustain, protect and empower you to perform even beyond the high expectations we have of you.” Ku ori’re. Oye a m’ori o.”
