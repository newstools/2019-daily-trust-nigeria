He said “The Federal Polytechnic Offa is known for discipline and peaceful co-existence. You must all steer clear of all forms of indiscipline and misconduct. Do not bring the name of your school into disrepute. The management would deal decisively with any student found to be involved in any misdeed. “Offences like examination malpractice, cultism, sexual harassment, indecent dressing and the likes are gross misconducts which attract serious sanctions. Any student caught associating with any cult group or unregistered associations/clubs will not only be expelled, but will also be handed over to the law enforcement agents for prosecution.” Offa Poly matriculates 6,646 students for 2019/2020 session Offa poly suspected cultists paraded by police Fee hike: NANS threatens to shutdown Offa Poly
