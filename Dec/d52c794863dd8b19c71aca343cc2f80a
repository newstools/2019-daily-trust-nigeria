Nigeria’s leading automotive trading platform, Cars45, has inspected over 40,000 vehicles in 2019 alone just as the Autopreneur’s network of the platform has recorded over 4000 sign-ups. Managing Director of the company Mr. Etop Ikpe, who disclosed this at a briefing in Lagos, said one of the problems discovered had to do with documentation. To address this challenge, he said the company had introduced the ShipEasyDirect service to help buyers with documentation to avoid running into problem with the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS). According to him, the main goal of Cars45 as a platform is to guarantee the protection of buyers and sellers when it comes to vehicle documentation. This, he said, has been largely achieved through entrenchment of best practices which every individual on its platform must adhere to. He said the platform of Cars45 has empowered thousands of entrepreneurs nationwide in the automotive value chain through the Autopreneur recently introduced by the organization.  “Today our entrepreneurial network has more than 4000 sign-ups and more sign-ups every day. So you can see that through our platform, we are empowering more and more people and that has always been our goal.”
