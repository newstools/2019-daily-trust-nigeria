The Abuja chapter of the International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA) has called on victims of sexual violence to put an end to the culture of silence by speaking out. The call was made during a one day rally of the branch to Utako market and Jabi Motorpark as part of activities to mark the 2019 United Nations 16 days of activism against gender-based violence. The rally, which was held on Wednesday in Abuja, was to sensitize Nigerians on the need to stop the violence against women and girls. The chairperson of the chapter, Rachael Adejo-Andrew, said the rally was held to show support to the UN’s annual campaign of violence against women and girls. “I will say we can still do more; the government, the civil societies, ministry of women affairs, we are actually doing a lot but we still need to do more because what about the people in the remote places, we also need to take the sensitization to them. “We are saying to every woman who is suffering any form of violence, be it physical, sexual or emotional, don’t stay in silence and so we are saying to them, let us break this culture of silence, come out and speak,” she said.
