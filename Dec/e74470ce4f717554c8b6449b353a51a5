The picture of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar with the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu has been generating mixed reactions in the social media. The picture has been trending on various social media platforms since Saturday. Tinubu, according to the picture shared by his media aide, Mr Tunde Rahman, on his Facebook Page, was seen having a tete-a-tete with the Adamawa Governor Umar Fintiri watching. They reportedly ran into each other at the VIP lounge of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport (NAIA) Abuja. Though both Tinubu and Atiku were founding members of the APC, the former vice president later defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) where he was the presidential candidate in the 2019 election. Atiku was also a presidential aspirant of the APC who lost to Buhari in the buildup to the 2015 elections. But the media aide to Tinubu, however, said that there was no political undertone to the meeting. He told Daily Trust last night that there was no big deal about the meeting, saying both politicians were heading in different directions. Rahman confirmed that Tinubu was heading to Minna to receive an honorary award, while Atiku was going to Kaduna. When asked if the meeting had to do with any alliance ahead of 2023, he said there was no alliance coming, adding that “it was just a chance meeting and there is no more to it.”  PDP, Tinubu trade words over Atiku comment Atiku, Tinubu  consider plan ‘B’ How APC Can Win 2015 Presidency
