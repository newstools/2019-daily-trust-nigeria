It took the quick intervention of soldiers and other security personnel in Calabar to abort the movement of over 150 militants from the Calabar creeks from vandalizing the Margaret Ekpo International airport. The militants were protesting non adherence to the agreements the state governor Sir Ben Ayade reached with them last year when he convinced them to surrender their arms and come out of the creeks. The militants were able to move from communities in Akpabuyo, Bakassi LGAs and Calabar suburbs into the main Calabar town where they blocked major roads and occupied part of the airport for six hours, harassing members of the public. Spokesman of the militants who did not give his name said, “Last year when the state government forced us to surrender some of our guns in a public ceremony, we came out from the creeks and accepted hoping the government would play out its own part.  We were assured that our members would be taken care of by payment of monthly stipends, and trainings.  One year after, they have not done anything.” Meanwhile, the Nigerian Labour Congress has called the State government to respect and implement all the agreements reached with the militants to abate the heightened insecurity, kidnapping, cultism and killings in the state. The Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) in an appeal to the state government signed by its Vice chairman, Comrade Lawrence Achuta and Comrade Ayi, acting secretary, decried the increasing spate of insecurity in the state, and called for respect and implementation of all agreements reached with the militants to resolve the insecurity problems.
