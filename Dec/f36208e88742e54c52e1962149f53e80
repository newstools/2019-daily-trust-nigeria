A former Commissioner for Environment, Lagos State, Dr Muiz Banire, at the weekend lamented the effects of pollution to the health of the citizens and the economy of the state. Banire, who is the Chairman, Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON), urged the state government to make laws regulating the different kinds of pollution. The AMCON Chairman, who was the Special Guest of Honour at the 27th Annual Scientific Conference and Annual General Meeting, held in Lagos, revealed that having noticed the effects of noise pollution in Lagos, one of the things he did as Commissioner for Environment was to ensure that pollution of all kinds was reduced to a manageable level. Banire described noise pollution as dangerous, saying it was the major reason students performed below standard in WAEC and JAMB examinations. “We need to set a template that will guide us in enforcing laws on environmental pollution in Nigeria. And that should be part of the resolution of this conference to create a parameter for enforcement,” he said.
