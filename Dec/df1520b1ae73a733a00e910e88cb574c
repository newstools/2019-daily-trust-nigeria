There were speculations as to why the federal government released Dasuki and Sowore, a former presidential candidate who was accused of treason. Officials of the US Embassy in Abuja were reportedly cited at the court during the resumed hearing of the fundamental rights enforcement application of Sowore in which a Federal High Court judge, Justice Ahmed Mohammed, withdrew from the matter. Following reported invasion of the courtroom to re-arrest Sowore on November 29, some members of the US Congress including Bob Menendez and Karen Bass had in separate statements called for the intervention of the US and the United Nations over alleged human rights violations in Nigeria. Also, the US State Department and the UK government asked the Nigerian government to respect rule of law.
