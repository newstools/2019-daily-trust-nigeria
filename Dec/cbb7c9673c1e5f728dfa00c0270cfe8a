Residents of Sukuku community in Kwali Area Council were thrown into panic after some villagers ran into kidnappers on a farm at the community. A resident of the community, Saleh Ayuba, said the incident happened on Tuesday, when some women who went to the farm to fetch firewood came across gunmen on the farm, a situation which, he said, forced the women to hurriedly return home. He said the women immediately rushed to alert the village chief of the community. The villagers suspect the gunmen could be those that kidnapped a young man after killing the victim’s father last Thursday at the community. “Some women who went to the farm to fetch firewood saw gunmen  whom they suspected to be kidnappers and they returned home to report to the chief. It was later discovered that the kidnappers were same as those that abducted the young man and killed his father,” he said. He however said tension had reduced as security men have been combing bushes and forest around the community for the kidnappers. Meanwhile, Nasiru Usman, who was abducted by gunmen at Sukuku has regained his freedom after payment of N200,000 ransom to the kidnappers. A member of the victim’s family, who preferred anonymity confirmed the release of the victim, last Thursday at about 4:30pm at a forest in the area. He said the kidnappers had earlier demanded for N1 million, but they later accepted N200,000 after series of pleadings by the family,” he said. The traditional ruler of the community, Aminu Sarki, who spoke through phone also confirmed the release of the victim after eight days in captivity.
