The FCT police command has confirmed the killing of four persons by gunmen suspected to be kidnappers at Kwaita- Abaji route, along Abuja-Lokoja road. A statement by the command’s spokesperson, ASP Mariam Yusuf, said one of the kidnappers was arrested by the police operatives during the attack by the gunmen along the route. She said the police through their covert operation have also been able to dismantle the kidnappers’ camps and dislodge their base, which she said prompted the kidnappers to seek refuge. According to her, the fleeing kidnappers while scampering for safety suddenly entered the highway and shot at oncoming vehicles and killed four persons. “But the swift intervention of the police operatives, led to the arrest of one of the kidnappers while efforts are on to apprehend his cohorts, “she said. The police command, while commiserating with the families of the deceased, also reiterated the command’s commitment to provide security for residents of the federal capital territory.
