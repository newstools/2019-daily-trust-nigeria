The Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom  Wike, has rejected the offer of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leadership to intervene in his conflict with his counterpart in Bayelsa State, Seriake Dickson, over the Soku Oil Wells/fields returned to Rivers State by the Federal High Court. Governor Wike, in a press statement issued on Monday by his Special Adviser on Media, Simeon Nwakaudu, said that there was no premise for the intervention by the PDP leadership since the Federal High Court had already determined the issue in question. He said, “Anybody who is not satisfied should go on Appeal.  Are they interceding on behalf of someone who betrayed the party? “I am not going to sit down with anybody to discuss anything as it relates to Governor Dickson. I have no business with Governor Dickson.” He said the right thing for Dickson to do was to resign from the PDP so that leaders in Bayelsa State could rebuild the party. The governor said the party’s intervention was no longer profitable in view of the incalculable damage done by the outgoing governor. “The party should have waded in when they saw fraud – that Dickson was killing the party in Bayelsa State. Do you know the effect of APC winning Bayelsa State? And they are talking of wading in.” Oil wells: Wike rejects PDP's move to end feud with Dickson You are responsible for PDP defeat in Bayelsa, Wike replies Dickson You are responsible for PDP defeat in Bayelsa, Wike blames Dickson
