Nigeria has given assurance of its total commitment to the full implementation of the agreement entered into by the organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and ten Non-OPEC Member States. In a tele-conference with the Chairman of the OPEC-Non-OPEC Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) and Minister of Energy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Prince Abdulaziz Bin Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud over the weekend, Nigeria’s Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, recalled his assurance to the last meeting of the JMMC held in September, in Abu Dhabi. He said at the meeting that Nigeria would, within three months, be 100 percent compliant with the agreement that it had voluntarily entered into. In a statement by his spokesman, Garba Deen Muhammad, the minister noted that in fulfilment of that pledge, Nigeria’s compliance level has witnessed tremendous progress, month by month, since last August resulting in 100 percent compliance in November 2019. The minister commended Saudi Arabia for the extra burden it has taken on its own volition to help stabilize the global oil market. Prince Abdulaziz commended Nigeria for the efforts it has made since August to ensure compliance, noting that the agreement came into effect at the same time when Nigeria’s Egina was coming on-stream.
