Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State has vowed to prosecute any worker who was found to be improperly employed in the local governments in the state. He also promised the same treatment for those found to have added names of ghost workers in the councils payrolls. ‘I will not spare any worker found on the payroll of the local government no matter how highly placed he or she  may be,” Governor Zulum warned in Askira, Askira-Uba Government Area. “Local government is to bring development to the grassroots. We will not tolerate a situation where only a few people will consume the money to the detriment of the majority.” Professor Zulum spoke when he paid  homage on the Emir of Askira, Alhaji Abdullahi  Muhammadu Askirama in continuation of his condolence visit to communities attacked recently by Boko Haram insurgents in the local area. “Each month, we spend  N90 million on the payment of the salary of workers who constitute less than one percent of  the population of the local government to the detriment of the development of education, healthcare, and water supply.” He said for any meaningful development to take place at the local government level government must get rid  of ghost workers on the payroll of the local government councils.” Zulum announces development plan for Southern Borno Gov Zulum marks Christmas with Christian communities Ghost workers: Zulum withdraws LG secretaries powers to recruit workers
