Stakeholders have called for a rethinking of aviation development model to make the industry more profitable in the next five years, saying the development must not be tied to a regime. They spoke at the fourth quarterly Business Breakfast Meeting organised by Aviation Safety Roundtable Initiative (Aviation roundtable), a group of aviation stakeholders. The theme of the roundtable which attracted eggheads in aviation was ‘Nigerian Aviation Beyond 2025’. Director-General/CEO of the Consumer Protection Council (CPC), Barr. Babatunde Irukera, who was one of the discussants, said airlines must change their business model. Besides, he said, it is high time the airport experience was improved upon, adding that Nigerian airports must become “comfort zones” and not mere “travel ports.” The DG, who said everything Nigeria must be thinking about post 2025 boils down to consumer protection and competition added that the country has been recording huge number of no-shows at the airports because of bad airport experience. Irukera also called for interlinking among domestic airlines, saying it is not profitable doing point to point. He decried the poor connectivity within African countries, saying, “It is more expensive travelling within Africa than travelling within Europe, Asia and within the United States.” ‘Aviation roadmap to spur massive employment, not job losses’ National carrier: Indigenous operators seek level-playing field In search of viable aviation business in Nigeria
