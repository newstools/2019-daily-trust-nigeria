Chairman of the Igbo social-cultural organisation, Ohaneze Ndigbo, Anambra State chapter, Chief Damian Okeke-Ogene, at the weekend said a Nigeria president of Igbo extraction can only be possible when Ndigbo joined hands together. Chief Okeke-Ogene made the statement during the 2019 Anambra State Association of Town Union (ASATU) community service award was held in Awka, the Anambra State capital. “The actualization of Igbo presidency in 2023 can only be possible if Igbo join hands together and strive towards its actualization. The presidency cannot be given them on a platter of gold. Ndigbo must be united and work for it,” he said.
