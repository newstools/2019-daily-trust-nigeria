The DPR Zonal Operations Controller, Abuja, Buba Abubakar in a statement on Wednesday charged the general public to avoid panic buying and go about their normal businesses. He said the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has assured the nation of availability of petroleum products that can sustain the nation throughout the yuletide and beyond. “Therefore, DPR hereby warns all Petroleum Products Marketers to desist from any form of profiteering, ranging from petroleum products diversion, hoarding, adulteration, under-dispensing, overpricing or any other sharp practice to avoid severe sanctions that might be meted on any defaulting marketer,” he said.
