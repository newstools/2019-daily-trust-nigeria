Stakeholders in aviation have tasked the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) to review the conditions for the establishment of airlines. This follows the short lifespan of many airlines in Nigeria with over 50 airlines going under. The observation was made by experts and discussants in a communique issued at the end of the fourth quarter aviation roundtable on ‘Nigerian Aviation Beyond 2025’. Daily Trust reports that there are about five rigorous stages involved in the issuance of air operator certificate (AOC) to prospective airlines. According to the communique signed by Olumide Ohunayo, with the demise of numerous private airlines and the failure of government to effectively manage airlines, government should relinquish control in their management. “To this end, NCAA should review upwards the conditions of establishing airlines that will compete effectively by 2025,” the communique said. It also stated that NCAA should encourage Nigerian airlines to restructure their business models towards a better passenger boarding experience and comfort to enhance business competitiveness beyond 2025.
