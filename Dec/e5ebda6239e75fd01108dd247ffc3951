The Senate has mandated its Committee on Legislative Compliance to investigate the delay in takeoff of the Hydro Electric Power Producing Areas Development Commission (HYPADEC) after nine years of its passage into law. The upper chamber while mandating the committee to probe the utilization of the sum of N612,177,269 appropriated so far to the Commission, directed the panel report back to the Senate within four weeks. The upper chamber, sequel to the consideration of a motion to that effect, also urged the Federal Government to, as a matter of urgency, constitute the Commission and make funds available for it in the 2020 budget. Sponsor of the motion, Senator Muhammad Enagi Bima (APC, Niger South) noted that the Act that established HYPADEC charged the Commission with the responsibility of managing ecological menace due to operation of dams and other hydroelectric power activities. According to him, the Act establishing the Commission was passed by the Seventh National Assembly in 2010 and signed into law by President Goodluck Jonathan.
