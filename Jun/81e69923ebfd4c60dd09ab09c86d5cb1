The leadership of the APC in Oredo Local Government Area (LGA) of Edo State has given a 48-hour ultimatum to the member-elect, Oredo East Constituency, at the House of Assembly, Chris Okaeben, to apologise to Governor Godwin Obaseki for smearing his reputation or risk being recalled. The party leaders gave the ultimatum at the weekend in Benin at their expanded meeting with attendance drawn from the 12 wards of the local government. Okaeben was among 16 members-elect who addressed a press conference accusing Governor Obaseki of trying to impose the House speaker on them and demanded immediate inauguration of the assembly. Speaking to journalists on behalf of others, Rev.  Michael Egharevba said the leaders unanimously agreed to call on Okaeben to tow the path of honour and apologise to the governor.
