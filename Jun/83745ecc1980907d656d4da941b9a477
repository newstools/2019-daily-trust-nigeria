One of the leading APC governorship aspirants in Kogi State, Prince Mustapha Mona Audu, says the endorsement of Governor Yahaya Bello by traditional rulers who accompanied him to the Presidential Villa cannot save him because of his non-performance. Mona Audu, whose father could have become governor in 2015 but for his sudden death before the announcement of results, said the traditional rulers were not representing the people of Kogi State. Speaking, yesterday, in Abuja at a news conference to unveil his Kogi Prosperity Plan, he said the state could only develop with the presence of a purposeful and responsible leadership. On the visit of traditional rulers to the Presidential Villa, he said, “What we saw, to be honest was a display of poverty. The traditional rulers have no business going to the president to seek support or to reintroduce the governor to him. “That was not necessary. We do not believe that the traditional rulers who were at the Villa yesterday (Wednesday) are representatives of our people or Kogi State. That is the truth and we have to be honest with ourselves. “These rulers are setting a very bad example. These rulers are showing us that their pockets are more important than their people. Kogi is a state where civil servants are committing suicide; people are putting ropes round their necks and dying,” he said.
