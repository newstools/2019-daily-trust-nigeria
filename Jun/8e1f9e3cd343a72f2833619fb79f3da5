Nurudeen Abdul-Kadiri, the Chief Imam of Alhaja Sideeqat Ahmad Megida Central Mosque, Ikorodu, Lagos, has urged Nigerians to support President Muhammadu Buhari with prayer to enable him succeed in his second tenure. Abdul-Kadiri made the plea after the Eid-el-Fitr prayer held in the mosque premises in Ikorodu on Tuesday. According to him, there is need for all Nigerians to support Buhari morally and spiritually for him to achieve tremendous success during his second tenure. “The expectations of the Muslims are that President Buhari should continue on the path he had started such as the issue of the security; although our president is trying in ensuring security of lives and property in Nigeria. “Government should revamp the economy and improve on policies and programmes that would benefit the downtrodden in the society. “This government should try to create more jobs, and there is need to sustain the fight against corruption as well as indiscipline in the society,” he said.
