A group of protesters under the aegis of Muhammadu Buhari Osinbajo Dynamic Support Group (MBO-DSG), yesterday, dismissed report on the presence of a cabal in Aso Rock. The protesters, who are members of the ruling APC, were led by the MBO-DSG National Coordinator, Usman Ibrahim. Ibrahim who spoke during the protest at the APC national secretariat in Abuja, said President Muhammadu Buhari had rights to exclusivity of appointments of his personal aides, advisers and ministers. He said, “President Buhari rode on the public trust in 2015 to emerge as the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and has never deviated from his commitment and covenant to the Nigerian project. “The cabal ideology was introduced into the Nigerian political lexicon from time immemorial and every administration that existed before now had been accused to be under the influence of a perceived cabal. This we view as a familiar song and we felt if our brothers are genuine in their agitations, they would have made their points and register their grouse without sinking into error of language.” The APC National Auditor, Chief George Moughalu, who spoke with the protesters on behalf of the National Chairman, promised to deliver their message to members of the National Working Committee (NWC).
