The Institute of Agricultural Research (IAR) of the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, has developed insect-resistant cowpea that has the potential of earning foreign revenue for Nigeria. This was made known by Professor Ishaq Mohammed Faguci, who is the lead scientist of the research team that developed the new cowpea variety. The team tagged, ‘‘Pod Borer Resistant Cowpea Research Team’’ has through this effort been able to address one of the major challenges of cowpea production in Nigeria, Professor Faguci explained. He added: “One of the main research efforts of IAR over the past 10 years had been to combat the menace of a destructive insect that affects cowpea production in Nigeria. The insect is called “Maruca pod borer” and is known to cause up to 80 per cent yield loss in cowpea fields. The research efforts of IAR had yielded positive results. “The results of scientific efforts apply in modern techniques of genetic engineering has led to the development of cowpea variety that can protect itself against destructive effects of the pod borer. This now makes it possible for farmers to grow cowpea in their fields with very minimal insecticide sprays.” By this development, Nigeria can earn up to N48 billion in foreign exchange from the export of the new cowpea variety, as Nigerian cowpea would be free from toxic that usually hinder its export, it was gathered.
