Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State has waded into the lingering crisis in the state chapter of the APC to reconcile the two factions led by the Alhaji Hadi Ametuo and Hon. Abdullahi Bello-led executives. The Ametuo-led group has been working at cross purposes with the Hon Abdullahi Bello-led executives which is believed to be enjoying the support of the governor. A statement from the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Onogwu Muhammed, said the reconciliatory meeting which was midwifed by the governor, held at the Kogi Governor’s Lodge in Abuja at the weekend. When Daily Trust contacted Hadi Ametuo on phone, he confirmed that his group was part of the reconciliatory meeting called by the governor to end the rift between the two factions. He expressed his readiness to give the needed cooperation and allow peace reign in the party ahead of the forthcoming election. Kogi: Gov.
