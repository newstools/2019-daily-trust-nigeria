The Chairman of Abaji Area Council, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, has said that arrangements have been concluded to commence the construction of a more befitting ultra-modern market in the area. Ajiya disclosed this on Tuesday when he was led by officials of the work’s department of the council to inspect the market located along Toto road in the council. He said the council deserved a more befitting modern market, which he  said would help in decongesting the facilities at the old market, and reduce the challenges traders who sell their wares face inside the market. He said the architectural design for the market had already been forwarded to him, and it would be handed over to the legislative arm of the council for consideration. “And from the architectural design, the new proposed ultra-modern market  will be built in three or four phases and will have over 400 shops, as well as toilets, warehouses and a parking space, “ he said. The chairman also said the market would have a mini police outpost in order to checkmate  crime. He noted that the market would also help in boosting the council’s revenue. According to him, the market project was part of his second term administration’s policy of urban renewal to help stimulate economic growth of the council.
