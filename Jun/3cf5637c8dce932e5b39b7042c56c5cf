The Independent National Electoral Commissionyesterday issued a Certificate of Return to former Imo State Governor Rochas Okorocha as senator-elect for Imo West Senatorial District. This was in compliance with last week’s judgement of the Federal High Court, Abuja. The commission, however, said it would appeal the judgement. INEC National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said this yesterday in a statement after the commission’s management meeting in Abuja. The commission expressed concern that the judgement might have set a bad precedent for desperate politicians undermining, disrupting the electoral processes and using the judiciary to legitimize their actions. According to him, INEC on Tuesday considered 14 memoranda involving judgments and orders in pre-election matters relating to the issuance of certificates and or withdrawal of certificates already issued in pre-election matters. The INEC had earlier denied Okorocha his certificate of return following an allegation that the Returning Officer of the Commission declared him winner of the election under duress.
