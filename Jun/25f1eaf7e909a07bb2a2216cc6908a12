Also, the PDP has picked Sen Emmanuel Bwacha from Taraba State as Deputy Minority Leader, Sen Philip Aduda (FCT) as Minority Whip and Sen Clifford Ordia (Edo) as Deputy Minority Whip. The decision was reached at a meeting with the PDP National Chairman Uche Secondus in Abuja last night. Though the PDP was yet to make the decision official, it was gathered that it would be communicated to the Senate President Ahmad Lawan, who will read it at plenary on July 2. Abaribe was the chairman of the Senate Committee on Power during the just concluded 8th Senate, while Aduda and Bwacha maintained the principal officers’ positions they held.
