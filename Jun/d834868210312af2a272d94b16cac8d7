The Clerk of the Edo State House of Assembly, Yahaya Ogmobai, on Monday swore in two Members-elect who were not part of the nine members-elect sworn in last week. The members-elect sworn-in during an emergency were Emmanuel Okoduwa, representing Esan North East I, and Ojezele Sunday representing Esan South East constituency of the state. It would be recalled that nine out of 24 members-elect of the Assembly were on June 17, sworn-in by the Clerk of the House. Daily Trust reports that the swearing-in of the two lawmakers brings the total numbers of lawmakers who had been inaugurated to 11 while 13 Members-elect are yet to be sworn-in. The Speaker Rt. Hon. Frank Okiye, who congratulated the lawmakers said with the swearing-in, they are no longer members-elect but Honourable members of the House of Assembly. At the plenary sitting, the house elected Hon. Roland Asoro, member representing Orhiomwon South II, as House Leader, Hon Henry Okwuarobi, representing Ikpoba-Okha Chief Whip and Marcus Onobun, representing Esan West as Deputy Leader. Roland Asoro thereafter moved a motion for adjournment and seconded by Emmanuel Okoduwa, representing Esan North East I. The speaker however adjourned to July 17.
