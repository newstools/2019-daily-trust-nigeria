The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Zamfara State says it will exploit a window available to the party and seek for review of the Supreme Court verdict on the party’s primary elections in the state. State Chairman of the APC, Alhaji Lawali M. Liman, who disclosed this at a press conference in Gusau, said there were positions in the APC that were contested unopposed and therefore, the court ruling on primary election shouldn’t directly affect such positions. “We had a meeting with the party’s national chairman in Abuja and he told me that our great party had a window to exploit in respect of the INEC’s action and the Supreme Court judgement,” he said. Alhaji Liman further said the APC in the state had three Senate seats, two House of Representatives and 13 state assembly seats that were contested unopposed. He added that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was too quick to declare runners up with second highest votes because the Supreme Court ruled that parties with requisite spread should be declared.
