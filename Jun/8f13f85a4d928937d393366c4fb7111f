A group, Arewa Democratic Front (ADF), has asked the leadership of the House of Representatives to prepare the ground for Sokoto State to produce the next House Leader. Chairman of the group, Abubakar Ainu, in a statement said Sokoto State was the only state in the North that was yet to get a key position in the National Assembly. Ainu, who said Sokoto was not short of experienced legislators, made a case for Musa Sarkin-Adar, saying he should be considered for the position as he was in the House with lots of legislative experience. The group said Sarkin-Adar who represents Gada/Goronyo Federal Constituency of Sokoto State, had been consistent even as he stood by Femi Gbajabiamila in the battle for the seat of the speaker at the risk of losing committee chairmanship post throughout the Dogara era.
