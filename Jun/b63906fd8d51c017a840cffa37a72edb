Emir of Kanam, Alhaji Muhammadu Babangida Mu’azu has called on Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State to use his position as the Chairman of Northern Governors Forum to intervene in the ongoing feud between Kano Emirate Council headed by Emir of Kano, Alhaji Muhammad Sanusi II and the Kano State Governor Alhaji Abdullahi Umar Ganduje. The Emir of Kanam made the appeal in Jos at the weekend during an annual traditional Sallah homage by the Muslim community of the state to Governor Simon Lalong. In a statement signed by Solomon John Gujor, Deputy Director, Press & Public Affairs of the state said that Emir Mu’azu noted that as Emirs and Chiefs in the states of the North, their primary duty is to work with their state governors and state government as indivisible team, adding that by so doing, they are expected to be partners in progress. The statement quoted the emir saying that, “the intervention of the Northern Governors Forum leadership would help in bringing to an end the feud between Governor Ganduje and Emir Sanusi II, so that they would all work for peace and progress of Kano State under the present dispensation.” Frank lauds Ganduje over Sanusi BREAKING: Ganduje, Emir Sanusi in dialogue meeting Late AVM Mukhtar Muhammad buried in Kano Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
