Niger State Chapter of the National Youth Council has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to consider zoning the North Central ministerial zonal slot to Niger State. The group said in the event Buhari decided to appoint ministers from the six geopolitical zones of the country as part of the plan to expand his cabinet, Niger deserved to produce the nominee from the North Central because it gave the president and the APC the highest votes in the last general elections. Chairman of the council Bello B. Sharif made the appeal, yesterday, while speaking to Daily Trust in Dutse. He argued that this is the time for Niger to produce a zonal minister and that there were eminently qualified people that could man the office. He said among other chieftains, Sale Sahabi Darangi sacrificed his time, energy and wealth for the victory of the party at both state and national levels. “Among the most qualified from Niger State is the former governorship and senatorial aspirant, Sale Sahabi Darangi. Apart from his loyalty to APC, Darangi’s commitment to the party contributed to its victory during the governorship and presidential elections,” he said.
