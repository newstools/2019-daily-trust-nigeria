Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State has reiterated the need for a centralized revenue system towards improving the internally generated revenue of the state. He made the call, yesterday, when he visited the Nasarawa Geographic Information System (NAGIS). He said, “establishment of NAGIS has been noble as it is sustaining a central revenue system which will go a long way in meeting the prospects of development in Nasarawa State.” He added that the state government would not relent in ensuring that NAGIS was fully supported, and called on the consultants to encourage and re-train the NAGIS staff to ensure continuity and for other sectors to emulate. In his remarks, Director General of NAGIS, Mr. Sunny Agassi, said the agency was established in 2012 and has graduated from analogue to digital platform and is poised to improve the revenue generation drive of the state. The consultant, Mr. Rowland Clause, said NAGIS has modern digital land administration, physical planning and development control which would improve the revenue generation of the state.  ‘NAGIS generated N1.5bn in 2015’ Nasarawa to generate N5bn from land transactions Nasarawa in final phase of Geographic Information Service Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
