The Sustainable Democracy Agenda (SUDA), a pro-democracy group, has called on senators elected on the platform of PDP to shun ongoing political manoeuvres aimed at causing a divide in the 9th Senate over election of presiding officers. The group, in a statement by its National Convener, Ibrahim Usman, said senators-elect under the umbrella of the PDP should avoid being dragged into a needless rebellion within the majority APC mainly aimed at splitting the leadership of the party, which had endorsed Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan as its choice for leadership of the 9th Senate. SUDA said: “We call on PDP senators elect to put the interest of a stable 9th Senate above all other considerations. There is no point joining forces with a few rebellious senators of the APC in an obviously futile attempt at frustrating the decision of the APC. “The PDP lawmakers, as members of a former ruling party, must appreciate the need for observance of party supremacy, which formed the foundation of the PDP during its 16 years reign.” Senate Presidency: APC governors, senators-elect hailed over Lawan’s choice Senate presidency: Choice of Lawan not imposition — Group Senators-elect urged to reject secret voting Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
