A former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie Oyegun, has said the party may lose the 2020 governorship election in Edo State if it fails to resolve the crisis ravaging it. Oyegun said this, yesterday, in Benin while reacting to the leadership crisis rocking the Edo State House of Assembly. The Clerk of the House, Yahaya Omogbai, had on Monday during the inauguration of the house swore in nine out of the 24 members-elect. The members later elected Frank Okiye representing Esan North East I as speaker and Frank Idiaye as deputy speaker. Oyegun who spoke to our reporter on phone, described the crisis rocking the assembly as the handy work of a political godfather. “Godfather is at work. That is all I can say.” “All that I know is that APC can easily lose Edo State to the opposition party if they are not careful. So, it is in the interest of all stakeholders in the party to work together to settle the rift,” he said. “I will advise members of the party, especially party leaders, to be very careful and settle the crisis because they can easily lose the state,” he added.
