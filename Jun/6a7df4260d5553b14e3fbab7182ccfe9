It was tragic for residents of Oke-Iba area, Ikirun, in Ifelodun Local Government Area of Osun State on Sunday as Azeez Adeleke, a mechanic in the community, was killed over a petty argument at a birthday party. The 25-year-old man was said to have attended the birthday party at the Igbole area of the town where his life was terminated. Detail of what led to the argument at the party was not clear but eyewitness said the deceased challenged some boys who sat on his motorcycle, from where the argument ensued. One of the residents of the area who preferred anonymity said:  “Azeez attended the birthday party organized by Wasiu for his child on Sunday. He got there around 5pm and left 7pm. He was leaving when he met four boys on his bike. He told them to leave so that he could move. That was how the argument started and now he is dead. We suspected that he was hit with charm because he was asking for water after he was beaten. He died few minutes later”. The Police Public Relations Officer, Osun State Police Command, Folashade Odoro said she had not been briefed about the incident.
