A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kano state and the chairman disciplinary committee of APC Kano, Alhaji Ahmadu Haruna Zago has revealed that, for women and children to stand a better chance in the APC-led government, there is a need for the President’s wife, Hajiya Aisha Buhari, to run a fully operational office of the first lady for a stable sustainable development in the country. Speaking in Kano, Zago revealed that APC in Kano is in support of Aisha Buhari as a first lady taking into consideration her humanitarian activities without the office of the first lady which he described as being very commendable. He added that with operational first lady’s office, a lot would be achieved especially for women and children. According to him it is not a crime to allow the first lady’s office to operate, as doing that will not amount to going against any constitutional provision and that by so, positive things could be achieved with much ease. “We are all aware of the good things done by Aisha Buhari in many states of the federation with clear reference to recent intervention to Katsina state. “Therefore, we strongly believe that should a better opportunity be given to her, a lot will be achieved especially with women, children and the rural dwellers,” said Zago. He stressed that it is indeed very important for the APC-led government to consider having an operational office of the first lady as it is the wish of many well-meaning Nigerians.
