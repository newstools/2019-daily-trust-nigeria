Boko Haram insurgents in the early hours of Saturday stormed a mosque at Sajeri, near Ngomari, on the outskirts of Maiduguri, killing a worshipper. Witnesses said the insurgents stormed the Sajeri community during the RamadanTahajjud prayer (night prayer) by 2am, shooting sporadically before concentrating on the mosque. Sources told Daily Trust on Sunday that the armed insurgents opened fire on the congregation, causing a stampede with the worshippers and entire residents of the community fleeing in different directions. It was gathered that some persons sustained injuries in the process. “They grabbed a male worshipper and slaughtered him in the open, as majority of the worshippers fled towards Ngomari,” a source told Daily Trust on Sunday. “So far none of the casualties has been taken to any hospital in Maiduguri for treatment, but a few of them are receiving minor treatments at home,” another source confirmed. Security agencies have not issued any statement on the incident yet.
