Governor Emeka Ihedioha has set up a committee to review all laws made in the state. The governor said the review was to make them meet the expectations and desires of the people of the state. Speaking, yesterday, at a retreat for members-elect of the Imo State House of Assembly in Oguta, Ihedioha said the committee, which will be headed by the chief judge, Justice Pascal Nnadi, will harmonise all laws enacted by the state House of Assembly in order to give the state a new beginning. The governor charged the members-elect to be abreast of their responsibilities, stressing that he does not intend to run a government of propaganda, but one based on rule of law. He said: “As a government, we will take a radical departure from the past. I will not run a government of propaganda, but one anchored on due process and rule of law and so, you must be ready to do your work. “I will fire you with executive bills and we must adhere strictly to the budgetary process.” Ihedioha said the orientation programme presented an opportunity to begin to get to know one another as colleagues in the assembly and to also learn about their powers, roles and duties.
