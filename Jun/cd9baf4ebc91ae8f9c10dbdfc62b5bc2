The Nigerian Shippers Council (NSC) has said Nigeria lost about $9bn in 2015 to foreign shippers and about the same amount is lost annually till date. The executive secretary, Mr. Hassan Bello disclosed this, yesterday, in Abuja at a one-day seminar organised by the council for transport  journalists. The event, with theme ‘Optimising the full potentials of the transportation industry through journalism’ drew participants from the print, electronic and online media platforms. He said the amount is lost on freight – both dry and wet cargo – adding that the only way this annual loss can be mitigated is when Nigeria has indigenous international shipping line. “We lost $9bn on freight in 2015 and about the same annually because Nigeria does not own or operate international shipping lines,” he said. “This is why it’s important to pursue this issue of national fleet implementation. If we achieve the national fleet, we will earn that $9bn. If that sum is coming to Nigeria’s economy, you will imagine the effect that it would have,” Mr. Bello noted.
