The statement further called on the residence of the state to give the prospecting corps members a warm reception on their arrival and also solicited the support of private transport operators to assist in directing them to the venue of the orientation course. Margaret Iliya further called on other stakeholders, ministries, department and agencies to assist the corps members that would be posted to their respective organisations as their Place of Primary Assignment (PPA) for the one year mandatory national service.
