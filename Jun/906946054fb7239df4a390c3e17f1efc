An economist, Mr Chijioke Ekechukwu, has said that the first term of four years of President Muhammadu Buhari was filled with some laudable monetary and fiscal policies as well as major developments. Ekechukwu made this known to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Wednesday. He said the implementation of the Treasury Single Account (TSA) reduced corruption in the civil service and enabled government to track its finances at all times. Ekechukwu also said funding of the agricultural sector through the Anchor Borrowers’ Programme and other avenues remained a great achievement in the country. He said the funding has created many jobs in the rice value chain. The economist said the infrastructure development of roads, railway and airports were also worthy of note. He noted that there was also improvement in tax being generated by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) compared to previous regimes. Ekechukwu noted that there had been a remarkable stability in the Foreign Exchange Market, saying that though Nigerians expected the rate to come down further to less than N200 to a dollar. “The country’s external reserves have grown,’’ he said. Ekechukwu however urged government to address the problem of kidnapping. He said the manufacturing sector needed priority attention of both federal and state governments.
