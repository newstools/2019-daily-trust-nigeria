A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the FCT, Alhaji Musa Tanko Abari, has claimed that party stakeholders’ greed cost the party victory in Kuje Area Council. He explained that when the party changed ward and local government executives close to the elections, it destroyed the party’s cohesion and it became difficult for it to win at the polls. Abari, who spoke with our reporter, yesterday, in Abuja, blamed the former chairman of the council for allegedly tampering with the list of the ward and local government executives of the council. “The former chairman of Kuje Area Council tampered with the list of ward excos of the party. He changed most of them and from experience, I warned him but he still went ahead. “Some people turned themselves to demigod and decided who will get the party’s ticket,” he added. He further attributed the party’s loss, especially in the National Assembly poll to indirect party’s primaries in which, he said, many party supporters were injured and hospitalized. Seven party supporters died during the direct primaries. “And After three weeks of the primary, we had two different results of the primary. Just like the experience we had during NRC and SDP on direct primaries. It  was bad. People made more enemies than friends; your neighbour will refuse to enter your line, “ Abari said. The party chieftain noted that those whose property were demolished in Abuja, later returned to vote against the ruling APC. He however said the ruling APC would  continue to wax stronger in FCT and Nigeria at large.
