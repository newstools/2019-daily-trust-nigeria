The governor of Osun state, Adegboyega Oyetola, has reversed a foreign trip approved for the chairmen of Local Government councils in the state by the immediate past governor, Rauf Aregbesola. Aregbesola approved the trip for the LG chairmen last year for them to attend an overseas training but Oyetola cancelled the trip on the premise that the time is not auspicious. The Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Adeniyi Adesina, confirmed the cancellation of the proposed foreign trip by local government chairmen to attend a workshop. Adesin quoted Oyetola saying “Although, it is desirable to continue to expose government officials to capacity building, the time is not auspicious for this trip which was approved in September 2018.” The governor assured pubic officers in the state that they will continue to be given the benefit of training at the appropriate time as the financial situation of the state permits.
