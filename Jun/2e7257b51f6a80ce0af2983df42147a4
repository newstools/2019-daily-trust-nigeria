The Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) says it has  so far distributed 50,000 pre-paid metres to customers in Nasarawa State. Mr Oyebode Fadipe, General Manager, Corporate Communications, AEDC, made the disclosure to newsmen on the sidelines of an AEDC consumer consultative forum held in Karu Local Government Area of the state on Saturday. Fadipe, who said out of the 200,000 customers in the state, 50,000 had already received pre-paid metres, explained that the metering of customers was a process that would be sustained. “Metering is an ongoing thing. Have we been able to cover all our customers? Of course, we have not been able to cover all of them but that is the reason why this policy has come up; the policy of Meter Asset Provider. That is supposed to help us speed up the process of whatever metering gap that currently exists. So, I want to assure you that we will ensure that all of our customers are metered,” he said. He, however, disagreed with the views of some customers that the pre-paid metres had already been paid for by the Federal Government and donated to distribution companies for distribution to customers across the country free of charge. “The Federal Government does not fund AEDC or any other electricity distribution company in the country. “The pre-paid metering is strictly the responsibility of the electricity distribution companies in order to resolve the problem of power which lies on metering,’’ he said.
