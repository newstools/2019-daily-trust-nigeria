The prosecutor, Mr Stanley Nwaforaku, told the court that the case was reported at Maitama Police Station by one Houston Bawa of Kaduna Street, Wuse 2, Abuja, on behalf of one Dr Temiwa Balogun of same address. Nwaforaku said on April 29, the defendant was entrusted with N50,000 to purchase a sewing machine in Kaduna and to deliver it on May 3.
