President Muhammadu Buhari must have interest in the forthcoming contest for the leadership of the National Assembly because he needs people he can work with smoothly and harmoniously, Sen. Abu Ibrahim has said. The senator, who represents Katsina South, told journalists in Abuja that it was a normal practice for any president around the world to have interest in the leadership of the legislature. “It is unfair to say the president shouldn’t have interest on who becomes the next senate president,” Sen. Ibrahim said. He has to find someone he can work with harmoniously. He may not openly campaign for the person. “The president is not barred from making preference. We need competent leadership. The party must come in to do the zoning of the positions; which it has done. “The issue of imposition is misunderstood. If someone is recommended, he must be elected by the senators on the floor. The only thing is that people have to subject themselves to the principles of their parties,” he said. The senator said as far as the contest for the National Assembly leadership was concerned, “Anybody conniving with PDP should be expelled. The party has done everything for you, so you should be expelled for working against the party.” Abu Ibrahim, who is not returning to the senate, said President Buhari should constitute a committee that would ensure the implementation of projects with a view to monitoring and correcting lapses.
