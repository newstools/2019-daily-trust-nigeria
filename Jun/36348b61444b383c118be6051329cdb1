Our correspondent observed that there were subtle campaigns by some of the aspirants and non-aspirants for the presiding officers’ positions during the valedictory session of the 8th Senate yesterday. Senate President Saraki appeared to have stirred the hornet’s nest when he addressed Deputy Chief Whip, Francis Alimekhena, as an aspirant for deputy Senate president. The following conversation ensued: Alimekhena: I am Senator Francis Alimekhena Saraki: And you’re aspiring for… Alimekhena: (laughs) I’m aspiring for DSP (Deputy Senate President) Saraki: And you’re not a mace snatcher (in reference to Sen. Ovie Omo-Agege, another DSP aspirant, who allegedly masterminded the snatching of the Senate mace last year). Also, when Lawan stood up to make his final remarks towards the end of the session, Saraki came back again to say: Saraki: Leader, you’re sitting side-by-side with Senator Alimekhena. Lawan: Yes, Mr President. Saraki: No, I just want to confirm that the two of you are sitting beside each other (apparently in reference to the contest). Lawan: President, I wasn’t here when Sen. Alimekhena spoke, but I was told of the comments you made about him. At some point during his last speech to his colleagues, Saraki said: “At this moment, I know the contest for the Senate President is between Lawan and Ndume. I wish the two of you good luck. Whoever emerges, I call on the senators to support him.” Both Lawan and Ndume engaged in tacit campaigns when they made their final remarks at the valedictory session. 9th Assembly: 11 aspirants jostle for Deputy Senate President, Deputy Speaker Breaking: Again, Senate adjourns plenary Just in: 8th Senate officially closes business Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
