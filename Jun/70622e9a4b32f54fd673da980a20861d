The Nigerian Army, under the leadership of Lt. Gen. Turkur Yusuf Buratai, has once again received a pat on the back for restoring peace and security in the formerly restive Niger Delta region from satanic forces of militancy and the nation at large. Some Rivers State-based civil society groups, known as Coalition of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) gave the commendation in an open letter to the army chief on Friday. The CSOs said the open appreciation of Buratai’s leadership became imperative following the successful conduct of the 2019 general elections. “We least expected that Nigeria would come out of it unhurt as it is today. But with the intervention of the Army under your leadership, we have seen a near-zero electoral violence and killings during and after the last general elections,” part of the letter signed by Comrade Tamuno George (Esq), Convener, Coalition of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) read. The coalition also hailed the army leadership for its display of maturity and professionalism in Rivers State despite the efforts of some unscrupulous elements to dent its image with unfounded allegations.
