Counsel to the Oyo State chapter of the Association of Local Government Chairman of Nigeria (ALGON), Barrister Kunle Sobaloju, yesterday, before the Oyo State High Court sitting in Ibadan, said the governor of the state, Engr. Seyi Makinde deserves to incur the wrath of law for disobeying existing court judgement. Makinde had on May 29, this year after his inauguration as governor of the state dissolved the executive chairmen of the 33 local government areas (LGAs) in the state against the judgement of Justice Aderonke Aderemi of the State High Court who had on May 6, 2019 said the government of the state did not have power under the law to dissolve the LGA chairmen. But in a case instituted by the state government to challenge the judgement, the counsel to ALGON, argued that the plaintiff has no moral right to dissolve local governments because they were elected chairmen by the people of the state. Sobaloju said what the government did by dissolving the LG chairmen was absolute disregard of law because at the time the governor took the action, there was no notice of application against the judgement that favoured the LG bosses, adding that the judgement has not been appealed against by the defendant nor set aside by the court. However, the leading counsel to the state government, Adeniyi Farinto, had earlier said the court didn’t follow the due process to serve the court application as expected to the defendant. The presiding judge of the case, Justice Ladiran Akintola, adjourned the case till June 30 for further hearing.
