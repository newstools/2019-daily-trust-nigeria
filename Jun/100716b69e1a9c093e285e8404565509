Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, has asked residents of Ijebu-Ode metropolis to stop dumping refuse indiscriminately into the drainages as flood wreaked havoc in some parts of the state. Abiodun spoke at the weekend during an inspection tour to some parts of the town affected by flood. Some of the areas visited by the governor included Igbeba, Paramount, Moborode, Italapo, Degun, Imowo and Ibadan Roads. The governor said he decided to visit the areas affected by flood to get first-hand information, warning that the residents must eschew the habit of dumping refuse in the drainage while raining. The governor disclosed that his administration would soon come up with a comprehensive plan to address the problem of perennial flooding in the state. “From what we have seen here, the biggest problem we have in Ijebu Ode is that the drains that cross the town are small concrete drains that are covered, so they don’t allow for maintenance because they are very tiny. Ijebu-Ode will require very big and open drains that can easily be serviced and maintained. So, we are going to have a comprehensive plan aimed at resolving these problems once and for all”, he said. He, however, sympathized with the victims, reiterating the need for the people to always clean the drainages close to them as this would allow for easy flow of water and save the roads, which were constructed with public fund, from being destroyed.
