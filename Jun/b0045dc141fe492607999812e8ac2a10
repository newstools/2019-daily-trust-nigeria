A House of Representatives member-elect for AMAC/Bwari Federal Constituency, Micah Jiba, has felicitated with Muslims in the territory. He also tasked them on the need to be united, tolerant and humble as exemplified by Prophet Muhammed, adding that love amongst residents would open doors to a new vista of national unity and pride. Jiba, in his Salah message to residents, advised Muslims and all Nigerians to use the period, which he described as a golden opportunity, to embrace one another in promoting lasting peace in the country. According to him, Muslims must not fail to sustain the discipline displayed during the Ramadan, and exhibit those qualities that would make FCT and Nigeria the best nation on the globe. He stressed the need for unity, tolerance and humility as exemplified by Prophet Muhammad, adding that love amongst the residents, irrespective of their ethnic or religious beliefs could open doors to a new vista of national unity and pride. “As you pray for the nation, I enjoin you to also pray for its leadership, for God to continue to guide, protect and give the president, Muhammadu Buhari, the strength and wisdom to steer the affairs of state,” he said. He said they should always engage in worthwhile endeavours that could contribute to the achievements of greatness in the territory and nationwide.
