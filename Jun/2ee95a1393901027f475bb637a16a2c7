A chieftain on the APC from Benue State, Comrade Dominic Alancha, says the time and the moment for Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila and Hon. Ahmed Idris Wase to take the lead in the House is now in order to correct the error of the past. Alancha, in a statement, said the deceit and force of 2015 must not be allowed to repeat itself as Nigerians could no longer endure the injury and assault of 2015 for long. He said the choice of Gbajabiamila and Wase spoke of hope, determination and vision, stressing that both of them will steer the ship of the House of Representatives to the path of moral rectitude, free of scandals, greed for power and crass indifference to the plight of the ordinary Nigerians. He said, “Their choice is guided by truth, party loyalty, reason, fairness, competence, capacity, integrity and their pan-Nigerian disposition fussed with national zealotry that they have cultivated from time immemorial. “The candidacy of both Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila and Ahmed Idris Wase speaks volumes about resilience and the willingness to take Nigeria indeed to the next level using the instrumentality of the legislature. That is what the reactionary elements fear most. They want to stop such a scenario but thankfully discerning Nigerians and especially the party, APC and conscientious Nigerians across political divides have bonded to enthrone them.”  Speakerahip: Gbajabiamila—Wase alliance unsettles Dogara’s camp Speakership: North Central elders seek Buhari, APC intervention …Youth group insists on Wase Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
