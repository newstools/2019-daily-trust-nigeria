Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State will not appoint commissioners earlier than November which will be six months after his inauguration, sources close to him have said. One of the sources claimed that the governor preferred to have all the former commissioners lead “task forces” to enable him complete some projects he started with them. Ayade was quoted to have apologised to the former 28 commissioners that they should not think he used and dumped them, but that he still had them in mind, the reason he created the “task forces” with the them at the helm of affairs. The governor was said to have told the former commissioners that the state was spending over N4 billion each month on salaries and emoluments whereas the total monthly federal allocation to it was less than N2 billion. The source said the governor had returned their official cars to them with a promise to give them generous allowances as they work with him as project managers to complete the various projects in the state. According to another source who is one of the over 6,000 appointees recently relieved, the governor was “no longer inclined to appoint such bogus number so that he can save money for the state.”  Ayade won't appoint commissioners till November I don’t need older folks in my cabinet — Ayade Ayade not bound by constitution to appoint commissioners - Lawyer Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
