A 25 year-old woman, Mrs Olawumi Adeleye, and her 14year-old step-son, who were abducted along Akure-Airport road in Akure North Local Government area of Ondo state last weekend, have regained freedom. They were said to be returning from church on Sunday when they were kidnapped  at Osi community along Airport road. The suspected kidnappers were said to have used cows to block the road to obstruct their car before pouncing on them. A source said the family paid a yet to be named amount of money before they were released. Meanwhile, the traditional  ruler of Iresi of Osi in Akure North Local Government area of Ondo state, Oba David Olajide, was said to have narrowly escaped being kidnapped along Oba-Ile, Airport road, yesterday afternoon. The traditional ruler, and his team were said to have resisted the kidnap attempts. The kidnappers used similar trick by blocking the road with cows trying to capture him and some of his co-travelers. The suspected kidnappers, it was learnt were caught unawares as they did not expect such resistance from the traditional ruler.  They too, it was gathered, fled in different directions, making it possible for the traditional ruler to escape.
