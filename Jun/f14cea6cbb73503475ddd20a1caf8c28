A Zuba Upper Area Court, Abuja, on Monday, sentenced a welder, Elisha Amadu, to six months in prison for stabbing a man in the head. The judge, Alhaji Gambo Garba, sentenced Amadu, 25, who resides in Gwarinpa Abuja, after he pleaded guilty to causing grievous hurt and begged for leniency. Garba gave Amadu an option to pay a fine of N20,000. He warned the convict to desist from committing crime. “The punishment would have been stiffer if the convict had not saved the court the pains of protracted prosecution,” he said. Earlier, the prosecution counsel, Mr Chinedu Ogada, told the court that the matter was reported on June 16 at the Gwarinpa Police Station, Abuja, by one Bobby Barnabas of Citee Villa, Gwarinpa Abuja. Ogada said on June 16, at about 7pm, the complainant went to one ‘Mariam shop’ in Gwarinpa village to relax and in the process he had a misunderstanding with the convict. “The convict violently broke a bottle and stabbed the complainant on his head and all over his body and he sustained serious injuries,’’ the prosecutor said. The prosecutor told the court that the complainant was taken to the Gwarinpa General Hospital where he received medical treatment. He said during police investigations, the convict did not give a satisfactory account for his action. The prosecutor said the offence contravened the provisions of Section 246 of the Penal Code.
