The Indian Police, on Monday, reported that no fewer than 15 people died and 35 others injured when a huge tent collapsed in north-western India amid heavy rain and strong winds. The accident occurred in the grounds of a school in Rajasthan state’s Barmer district on Sunday evening when more than 1,000 people had gathered for a Hindu religious event. Fifteen people, several among them senior citizens, died in the accident, district police chief Rashi Dogra Dudi confirmed. Thirty-five more injured were hospitalised but their condition was said to be “out of danger’’ by doctors, she added.
