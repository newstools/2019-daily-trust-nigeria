As Ethiopia sets to liberalise its telecom market, the Non-Executive Chair of the Commonwealth ITU Group (CIG) and a former Commissioner of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Dr Bashir Gwandu, has stated the need for strong and good regulatory framework encompassing sensible set of rules that encourages investment and protects the consumer. Gwandu, in his keynote speech at the Innovation Africa Digital Summit (IAD) 2019 held in Addis Ababa, last week, said effective, professionally competent and sufficiently empowered as well as financed regulatory institution will help the country to avoid some mistakes of the other countries in the region. The IAD summit attracted telecoms executives from Africa and around the world, more than any other summit held in Africa in recent times. Ethiopia’s telecoms market is considered to be ‘the big price’ and the last greenfield site in a push to liberalise, and end a state monopoly as well as open-up one of the world’s last major closed telecoms markets. Dr Gwandu dissected the telecoms market privatisation and liberalisation processes, breaking the issues logically from the point of producing succinct legal frameworks for both the privatisation, and that of the telecoms regulation, down to the market design and the choices available to government when it comes to competition planning up to the spectrum management and eventually service providers regulation.
