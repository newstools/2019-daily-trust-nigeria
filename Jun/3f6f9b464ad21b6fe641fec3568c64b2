African countries have been urged to pay more attention to tax revenue than relying on grants or oil revenue sources. Executive Secretary of the African Foundation for Development Communication (AFoDeC) Ikenna Osu, made the call recently in Abuja. He said for Africa to get taxation right, “they must not play politics with tax administration because taxation is never an all comers affair”. Osu, who spoke on the side-line of the Nigeria-France Business and Investment Forum, said on the current realities in the economy of most African countries, it is obvious that oil prices are not sustainable and foreign donors are attaching inhuman conditions to lending money to developing economies. He noted that oil jumped more than 3% to above $63 a barrel on Thursday after Iran shot down a military drone belonging to the United States of America (USA) but noted that such sharp increase may not be sustained because of “push and pull factors.” As Buhari presents 2016 budget today Taxation and challenges of economic development Tax burden and business survival Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
