The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has said the Federal Government’s Homegrown School Feeding Programme will commence in the territory at the end of the current academic session. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary of the Administration, Anthony Ogunlewe, at the weekend said implementation committee of the programme had been inaugurated since August, 2018,  and it had sensitized stakeholders across the six area councils. He said the committee began the training of head teachers in schools across the FCT since they were to monitor the feeding programme in the schools. “Besides, the FCT Administration considers it imperative that only the qualified vendors that have met the stringent screening process were allowed to have access to children’s meals which we all must admit should be the highest quality in terms of hygiene and nutritional content,” he said. He also disclosed that no fewer than 85, 446 students across basic, secondary and tertiary institutions have benefitted from scholarships within the last seven years. He said the scholarship scheme was one of the administration’s commitment to providing the best possible education services for indigent and vulnerable residents in the FCT.
