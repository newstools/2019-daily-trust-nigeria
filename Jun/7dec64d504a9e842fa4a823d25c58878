A Court of Appeal sitting in Owerri, Imo state has upheld the judgement of the Federal High Court which dismissed a suit filed by Senator Sam Anyanwu, challenging the emergence of Imo state governor, Emeka Ihedioha, as the gubernatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the last general election. Ihedioha had, at the party’s primary election held in Owerri last October, polled 1,723 to defeat Sam Anyanwu, who got 1,282 votes. Dissatisfied with the result, Anyanwu had approached the court seeking to nullify the victory of Ihedioha, saying he should be declared as the authentic winner of the primary election instead. The plaintiff had accused Ihedioha of engaging in over voting, thuggery, which he alleged, swayed the polls in favour of Ihedioha. But delivering the judgement, Justice Raphael Chikwe Agbo, reaffirmed that the Anyanwu did not convince the court on the prayers he sought. He said from the allegations of the plaintiff, the court could not establish the fact in his claims and therefore dismissed the suit for lack of proof. While Senator Anyanwu rejected the result of the primary election, five other aspirants, namely Senator Achonu, Prof. Jude Njoku, Chief Chukwuma, Ekomaru, and Chief George Ejike, had congratulated Ihedioha on his victory and went ahead to work for his victory at the governorship poll. While hailing the court judgement, Ihedioha urged Anyanwu to join hands with him to move the state forward. The governor also restated his resolve to run an all-inclusive government. 2019 Imo guber: Ihedioha wins in court Imo: Court strikes out suit seeking to stop Ihedioha’s inauguration Okorocha defeats Ihedioha at Appeal Court Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
