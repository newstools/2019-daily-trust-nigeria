The Agora of Zuba, Alhaji Mohammed Bello Umar, has urged youths in his chiefdom not to engage in drug abuse. Alhaji Umar, who was speaking shortly after he joined other Muslim residents to observe the Eid prayer to mark the Eid-el Fitr in the area on Tuesday, said drug abuse was responsible for most social vices in the society. He said improper child upbringing also contributed to the vices and called on parents to send their wards to school to acquire both western and Islamic knowledge so to be useful citizens and contribute positively to the development of society. The traditional ruler commended the FCT Administration for putting infrastructure in his chiefdom, which enhanced rapid development of the area. He also stressed the need for residents of the area to live in peace with one another irrespective of tribe, religious and ethnic differences. He commended security agents for their efforts towards tackling crime in the area. Alhaji Umar also appealed to the authorities of Gwagwalada Area Council and the FCT Administration on the need to renovate the road that linked Tungan Maje from the community. The chief Imam of Zuba Central Mosque, Alhaji Adamu Haruna, emphasised the need for leaders to always have fear of God and urged Muslims to, in the spirit of the celebration, forgive and show love to each other.
