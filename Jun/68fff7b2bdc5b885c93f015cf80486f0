Adamu Yakubu, National Coordinator, All Progressive Congress Civic Support Group/Nigeria Youth Enginering for Good Governance, made the appeal in a statement issued in Kaduna on Monday.

He also called for the appointment professionals as ministers and heads of engineering related ministries and parastatals to enhance Nigeria’s technological development. The Coordinator urged the leadership of the National Assembly to be youths friendly not only in appointments but also in churning out laws that would drive policies to engage the energies of young enterprising Nigerians. The group pledged support to the President and the National Assembly in the bid to take the country to the next level of growth and development.(NAN) Youth demands enabling environment to participate in politics Nigerian youths demand 60 per cent appointment Page 9 Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
