I can confidently tell you that nearly two-third number of us are voting for Femi and Wase as Speaker and Deputy come June 11, 2019. “By law, we need a minimum of just 181 to succeed but with the bi-partisan approach the campaign has adopted, we comfortably have far more than that. “Femi Gbajabiamila is a humble lawmaker that believes in constructive engagement and dialogue.
