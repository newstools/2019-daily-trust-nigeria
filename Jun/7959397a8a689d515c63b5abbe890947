The Centre Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has said Ebonyi State remains top in accessing various loans introduced by the Federal Government. The Assistant Director, Corporate Communication, of the apex bank, Mazi Samuel Okogbue, stated this in Abakaliki during a one-day cash fair on ‘Financial Inclusion’ held in Abakaliki. “These include Anchor Borrowers fund, bailout fund, infrastructure and agricultural loans,” he stated. His explanation came when a participant, Basil Nnanna, during question and answer session, called on the bank to issue loans to small scale business owners in the state. Okogbue further called on the participants and the people of the state to open bank accounts, adding that having a bank account remains the first sure way to access any of the loans the central bank has introduced. Also, Mrs Ngozi Eze who lectured the participants drawn from motor spare parts, building materials dealers, mechanics and petty traders in the state on ‘Clean Note Policy’, assured that the apex bank has taken notice of scarcity of lower denominations in circulation.Oando: SEC opposes Tinubu, deputy’s joinder suit CBN to spend N220bn on small scale businesses Stakeholders lament slow take-off of CBN’s N220bn MSMEs fund CBN investment in agriculture reducing unemployment, poverty - Official Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
