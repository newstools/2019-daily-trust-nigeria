Members of the Imo state House of Assembly on Tuesday raised alarm of alleged threats faced by communities in the state from Fulani herdsmen. Speaking at the plenary, Frank Ugboma, representing Oguta state constituency, said the Fulani herdsmen were “raining terror” on his constituency. According to him, the Fulani herdsmen were “killing, maiming and destroying farm lands” in his constituency. “Presently, the notorious herders are raining terror on the people of Oguta local government area, particularly in Ezi Osu, Izombe, Ejemekuru and entire Agwa communities by killing, maiming, destruction of farm lands and committing all kinds atrocious and  despicable acts of brigandage,” he said. He warned that the people may result to self-help if the authorities did not address the invasion of the area by herdsmen. The lawmakers, therefore, requested that the Brigade Commander 34 field artillery brigade, Obinze and the state commissioner of Police should dispatch soldiers and policemen to help bring the situation under control to avoid reprisal that might disturb the security of the state. The Speaker, Chiji Collins, who presided over the plenary, however mandated the assembly Clerk to communicate with the security chiefs in the state about the resolution of the House. The lawmakers, therefore, called on the police and army to combat the ugly situation, saying the activities of the herdsmen were threatening the peace and security of the state.
