The Supreme Court has declared Hamisu Mohammed Anani as the authentic candidate of the PDP for Wase Federal Constituency of Plateau State for the House of Representatives. In a judgment delivered by Justice Bode Rhodes-Vivour, yesterday, the court held that Anani’s name ought to have been forwarded to INEC having scored the highest votes cast in the October 3, 2018 primary of the PDP. The apex court upheld the judgments of the Federal High Court in Jos as well as that of the Court of Appeal in Jos, which both declared Anani as the PDP candidate of the said election, having won the majority votes in the primary election. Anani had in a pre-election suit with no. FHC/J/CS/49/2018, challenged the PDP over the exclusion of his name in the list the party submitted to INEC. In his judgment earlier, Justice Musa Kurya of the Federal High Court 2, Jos Division, said the plaintiff (Anani) had satisfied all conditions having scored the highest number of votes during the party’s primary election. Meanwhile, the PDP is challenging the victory of the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the February 23 election before the National Assembly Election Petition Tribunal in Jos.
