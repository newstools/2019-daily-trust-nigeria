The National Chairman of Zenith Labour Party (ZLP), Chief Dan Nwanyanwu, has advised President Muhammadu Buhari to choose only capable personalities as ministers as he starts his second term of four years. Nwanyanwu gave the advice, yesterday in Abuja, while fielding questions from  journalists after the National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of the party. He said Nigerians could not afford to wait for another six months before the appointment of ministers to man critical ministries such as defence, health, and transportation among others. “He should be sending the list of his ministers to the Senate for confirmation. We will not wait. No Nigerian will want to wait for as long as that of his first term. Now, from what he has said, he has learned a lot of things right, gotten the ropes right. “I’m sure he will not keep us waiting more than necessary. So, Nigerians are expecting, if not before the end of June, early July, his list of ministers should be with the National Assembly,” he said. Nwanyanwu added, “As regards the calibre of the people we expect to see, we expect patriots, we expect people with knowledge, we expect people that are determined to work for this country. “We can no longer take excuses, the president has gotten everything he wanted in the National Assembly, he’s controlling both houses, he has no reason to give Nigerians anymore, why he has not performed or why he did not choose good, credible Nigerians, whether they’re in APC, or they’re not in  APC.” PDP, ZLP warn Ajimobi, acting IGP over incessant attacks on oppositions Buhari’s new cabinet Buhari’s New Cabinet Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
