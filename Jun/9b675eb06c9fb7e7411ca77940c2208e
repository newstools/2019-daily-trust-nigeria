The Federal Medical Centre, (FMC) Keffi, Nasarawa State, has reduced delivery fees from N10,000 to N5,000. Chief Medical Director (CMD) of the hospital Dr. Yahaya B. Adamu stated this at a press conference held on Sunday. He said, “The management of the hospital has reduced delivery fees from N10,000 to N5,000 and not from N30,000 to N60,000 as speculated. The new rate came into effect following recommendations by the committee set up by the management of the hospital.” He was reacting to a publication in one of the national dailies (not Daily Trust) on an alleged petition purportedly written against him on issues ranging from masterminding services price hike to patients, high-handedness, and lack of performances among others. The CMD said contrary to speculations that the hospital was engulfed in management crisis, there was no feud at the centre. Dr. Adamu described the petition as baseless, unfounded and a calculated attempt to discredit the management of the centre. He claimed that he was not given fair hearing in the publication even when he invited the reporter for explanation on the alleged petition purportedly written by an imaginary staff of the hospital.
