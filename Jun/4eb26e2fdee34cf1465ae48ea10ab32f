Kwara State Governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, on Wednesday, lamented the condition of the state’s orientation camp for the National Youth Service Corps, NYSC, members, describing it as a “penitentiary” that is “not fit for human living.” He said the administration would do something quickly to rehabilitate the camp, beginning with fixing the water and health facilities. AbdulRazaq said this at the official opening and swearing in of the NYSC 2019 Batch ‘B’ (Stream 1) at Yikpata Orientation Camp in Edu Local Government Area of the state. “I apologise for the state of your living accommodation. After seeing them, it is like a penitentiary. It is not fit for human living. The people in charge before should have done better. By saying that, I have thrown a challenge to myself and my administration to make things better,” he said. The governor said he would look at the quick-fixes to make things easier for the corps members such as water and health facilities while others would be considered in the next fiscal years. AbdulRazaq challenged the corps members to come up with brilliant ideas that can transform the state, saying he would accommodate anyone with better ideas on how to create wealth irrespective of their backgrounds. The NYSC camp coordinator, Ikupolati Esther, lauded the governor for the visit and his promise to help give the facilities a facelift. “This Governor is a serious-minded Governor. They have said it and I have seen it. They say that seeing is believing,” she said.
