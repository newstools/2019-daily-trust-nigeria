The All Progressives Congress (APC) youths under the auspices of APC Young Stakeholders Forum have said they protested against the recent appointments announced by office of the President of the Senate because the beneficiaries of the appointment were known antagonists of the present government and critics of President Muhammadu Buhari and Senate President Lawan. The National Publicity Secretary of the forum, Abuh Andrew, who addressed the protesters in company of Ayo Oyalowo, Head, Digital Media, Presidential Campaign Council (PCC), Alwan Hassan, and Segun Tomori, among others, said the appointments had made every rational youth of the APC who championed the campaign for Ahmed Lawan’s Senate Presidency to question their choice. He said the actions of Senate President Lawan, especially regarding the appointments he has made so far bore the ‘telltale sign of a betrayal’. He expressed belief that the Senate president would not betray the faith and expectation that he would take unifying actions that would strengthen the APC as a progressive platform capable of sustaining the progress of the country.
