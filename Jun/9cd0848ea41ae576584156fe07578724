The Federal Capital Territory (FCTA) says it will soon relocate residents of Rugan Fulani community in the territory due to unhygienic environment. The acting secretary of FCT Health and Human Service Secretariat, Alhaji Musa Abdulraheem, while speaking during a routine immunization on Tuesday, lamented the poor living condition of residents of the community. He noted that the community was unhygienic and the environment filthy, saying residents depended on commercial boreholes as their source of water, which he said many of them cannot afford. He said the administration will look at how residents of the community would be relocated, saying many people do not know such community exists in the FCT. “We are going to get in touch with the Satellite Towns Development Department so that we plan what to do with the community because where they are currently staying is not hygienic and the environment is filthy, “ he said. The acting secretary added that the administration was making plans to drill additional boreholes in the community through the STDD to reduce the challenge of water problem in the community. He said there was no case of outbreak of any diseases in the community as reported, adding that the community only had poor access to healthcare services and water problem. “What is more important is that we have discovered them and we are going to serve them well by relocating them or if the place can be put in a better shape to serve them better, “ he added.
