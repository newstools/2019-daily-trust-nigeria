The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said it will implement sections of local and foreign observers’ recommendations on the 2019 General Elections that required the commission’s administrative action. INEC chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu said this on yesterday in Abuja, when the International Republican Institute (IRI)/National Democratic Institute (NDI) submitted their report for the 2019 general elections to the commission. According to him, the implementation of the recommendations would begin with the forthcoming  Kogi and Bayelsa states governorship elections. He however said that it would work with other relevant institutions on aspects of the recommendations that required consequential action beyond the mandate of the commission. Yakubu who said IRI/NDI observed the 2019 General Elections on the invitation of INEC commended them for submitting their report in good time. Speaking earlier, leader of IRI/NDI Observer mission and NDI Senior Associate for Afflrica and Regional Director for Central and West Africa, Chris Famunyoh, said they were at the INEC headquarters to thank the chairman for inviting the two organisations to observe the elections. 2019 polls: INEC urges accredited observers to submit election reports Our fears for 2019 polls  – Monitors Our fears for 2019 polls – International monitors Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
