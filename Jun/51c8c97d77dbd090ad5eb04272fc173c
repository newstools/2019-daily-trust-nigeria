The APC Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Yekini Nabena, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to lead fence-mending efforts and address obvious grievances in many states among party stakeholders. Nabena, who made the call yesterday in Abuja while speaking with journalists, said the ongoing war of words between some top leaders of the APC, particularly the current National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and immediate-past National Chairman, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, was an unnecessary distraction currently weakening the governing party. The Bayelsa-born APC chieftain appealed to both Oshiomhole and Odigie-Oyegun to end their public hostilities for the sake of the party and focus on the important task of forming government at the state and federal levels to deliver on the ‘Next Level’ mandate. He said the party needed a united house to ensure its growth and strength. Nabena said, “The losses the APC suffered during the 2019 general election in some states which we previously controlled is indeed worrisome. “However, we are still the governing party which produced the president, controls majority states and have an overwhelming majority in the National Assembly. “Compared to the failed Peoples Democratic (PDP), the APC remains the political party of choice; I urge our aggrieved members to remain in the APC fold and settle their differences. In fact, in a few months, we expect a huge influx from members of the rudderless PDP and other political parties into the APC,” he said.
