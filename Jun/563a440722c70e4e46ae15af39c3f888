The governor of Nasarawa State, Engineer Abdullahi Sule, has said security for lives and property is a necessity for development and growth. The governor spoke at an award ceremony organised by Karu Local Government Chairman, Samuel Gajere Akala, to honour some distinguished people of the state held in One-man Village. “I have been planning to make industrialization my number one priority. But since I assumed office, I have realized that security has overtaken anything I plan to achieve in my administration. Without security, there will not be any meaningful development,” Engr. Sule said. He urged the people of the state to tolerate one another to ensure peace and prosperity and to strive to develop the state, especially Karu, which is closer to Abuja. Those honoured at the occasion by the people of Karu for their sterling qualities in developing the state included the governor; his predecessor and the newly elected senator, Umaru Tanko Al-Makura; Senator Abdullahi Adamu, and the former Secretary to the State Government, Barrister Mohammad Abdullahi Hassan.
