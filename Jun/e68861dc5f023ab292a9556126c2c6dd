Former Governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo state has said that he has forgiven the returning officer for Imo West senatorial election, Prof.  Innocent Ibeawuchi, for delaying the issuance of certificate of return after declaring him winner of the election. Ibeawuchi had  claimed that he declared Okorocha  winner under duress. Okorocha while applauding the judgment  of a Federal High Court in Abuja, which ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission  to issue him his certificate of return as the Senator-elect for Imo West Senatorial District, said in Owerri that the forgiveness was in the spirit of reconciliation. Justice Abang had ruled that the Commission had no right under any known law in the Country to withhold the certificate of return of a candidate that has been announced and returned as winner of an election by the returning officer.
