The flight was, however, operated via Libreville Gabon while it will go through Douala on some other days with 40 minutes waiting time. It was the only non-South African Airline on the route between Nigeria and South Africa. The arrival of ASKY Aircraft B737-700 was welcomed with water canon salute and received by Staff of ASKY and Ethiopian Airlines at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA). The airport community also joined in the reception. The aircraft was commanded by Captain Dawit Muluneh with the flight departing Lagos for Johannesburg by 1645pm. Explaining the codeshare flight, the General Manager of Ethiopian Airlines in Nigeria, Mrs. Firihiewot Mekonnen, said ASKY is the operating airline while ET is the marketing airline. “Nigeria is one of our biggest markets where we bring the best of our aircraft and we always strive to give our best to Nigerians. As part of this motive we found out a lot of Nigerians travel to  South Africa. So we decided to help improve the connectivity for the passengers. “We have also availed many promotional fares so we invite Nigerians to use the best deals to Johannesburg “.
