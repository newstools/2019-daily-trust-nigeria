A Pan-Yoruba socio-cultural group, Yoruba Koya Movement, has called for synergy among the governor to defeat the challenge of kidnapping and other forms of insecurity facing their Yoruba-speaking states. The group yesterday, led other 26 socio-cultural and self-determination groups to hold simultaneous rallies across Oyo, Osun, Ogun, Lagos, Ondo, Ekiti as well as the Yoruba-speaking states of Kogi and Kwara State. Addressing other protesters who gathered at the Gani Fawehinmi Freedom Park Ojota, Lagos, the Coordinator of the movement, Otunba Deji Osibogun, said the challenges of kidnapping, robbery and other forms of arm banditry are getting out of hands and except the governors who are the Chief Security Officers of their respective states  to come together and fight the menace. ‘‘The rally is also to enjoin all governors in Yoruba speaking states to integrate towards economic, social and political development of Yorubaland and to encourage them to make the security of lives and properties of their people utmost priority. We are also to encourage Yoruba legislators both at State and National Assemblies to endorse, support and move motions that will expressly indicate where the Yoruba stands,” Osibogun said. The group’s coordinator also appealed to other stakeholders to work together with the governors, saying the task of ridding the society of criminal elements is a responsibility for all.
