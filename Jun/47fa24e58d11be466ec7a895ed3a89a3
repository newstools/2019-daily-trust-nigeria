The immediate past Minister of State for Mines and Steel Development Abubakar Bawa Bwari, has urged mining engineers and staff of the ministry to help get the Ajaokuta Steel Company working. Bwari was speaking at the send-forth dinner organised for him by the management and staff of the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development in Abuja on Monday. “We came to a ministry that was somehow lifeless and was in a coma. But we developed a road map that brought us to where we are today.  I want you to maintain the momentum. We can get Itakpe, Ajaokuta Steel Company working. And when you do, you will work with your head high,” Bwari said. The permanent secretary of the Ministry, Dr Abdulkadir Mu’azu said the mining sector witnessed transformation under the leadership of the former minister. “I do not need to say the laudable achievement of Abubakar Bawa Bwari and his brother Dr Kayode Fayemi. We knew what the mining sector was before 2015 and what it is today. They built more institutional capacity, brought up more innovation, gradually reduced illegal mining and more. They have transformed the mining sector,” he said. Dr Mu’azu said he and the staff of the ministry have learnt so much from Abubakar Bwaris humility, sincerity and openness. A former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon Ghali Na’abba extolled the exceptional leadership qualities of the former minister praying that God will provide more of such qualities in Nigeria.
