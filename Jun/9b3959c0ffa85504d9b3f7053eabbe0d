The schools emerged winners at the 2019 National School Entrepreneurship (N-SEP) Exhibition and Award which held at the Sheraton Hotel, Abuja on Tuesday. The exhibition was a forum where teenage entrepreneurs from across the country showcased their innovative businesses and community service projects to a panel of influential judges, civic and business leaders. The panel determined which team is the most creative and impactful in entrepreneurship. Hillside School Gwarinpa, Abuja which came first and Maria College Yangoji which came second will now represent Nigeria in the USA from August 8-13 alongside 30 other countries, including USA, Canada, China and South Korea among others.
