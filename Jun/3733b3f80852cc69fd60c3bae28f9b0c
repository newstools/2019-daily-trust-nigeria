Candidates who participated in the recruitment test of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) have applauded the Group Managing Director of the Corporation, Dr. Maikanti Baru, for organising a transparent and fair exercise across the country. The aptitude test was launched into the third stage on June 1, 2019 with a successful Computer Based Testing (CBT) for at least 60,000 candidates across 22 States of the country. Some of the candidates praised the NNPC for the smooth process. A candidate, Iheoma Okeke who participated in the Graduate Trainee test at lead British International School center in Gwarinpa, Abuja said: “I am hopeful because the process was smooth and organized. What tripped me the most was that the officials were friendly and fair to everyone which is far from what I usually hear”. Chief Operating Officer, Corporate Services of NNPC, Isaiah Inuwa, said the test would have not been possible if the Corporation did not collaborate with some institutions, to ensure the success of the programme.
