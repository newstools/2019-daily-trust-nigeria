A group, the Consolidated Capital Market Stakeholders Forum (CCMSF), has expressed support for the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) forensic audit report on Oando. Recall the SEC recently took regulatory action against Wale Tinubu, banning him and his deputy, Omamofe Boyo, from being directors of any publicly quoted company for five years. The duo were punished over infractions committed as leaders of the oil and energy company, Oando Plc. SEC also demanded the resignation of Tinubu and other board members and the convening of an extra-ordinary general meeting before July 1 to appoint new directors. In a statement signed by Umar Usman, president of the group, they noted with concern the level the issues surrounding the forensic audit of Oando Plc were degenerating into with some comparisms being made to the ETI issue. Umar said, “The Oando issue was a forensic audit, ETI’s was corporate governance audit. The scopes were totally different; they were not the same. It is laughable that they are being compared. “During the ETI investigation, it is on record that the ETI management and board co-operated with SEC, they did not take SEC to court to stop the investigation, they did not publish things about SEC in papers like we are seeing now,” he said. Umar said in the Oando case, the auditors engaged the management, which they resisted initially, adding that it was much later that the forensic audit was allowed to go through.
