The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said it will not comment on the controversy surrounding its alleged central server. Mr. Rotimi Oyekanmi, the Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, said this is to avoid running afoul of the election petition tribunal sitting in Abuja. According to him, by dwelling on this very contentious issue that is before a court of law, any journalist involved will be liable to sanctions by the tribunal. “The Tribunal gave this warning in its inaugural speech. It is not just acceptable that we continue to discuss what is clearly subjudice. PDP has made a case and it is being argued in court. “Why is it now being canvassed in the media? Is the purpose to influence the decision of the court? Let us exercise some discretion please and allow the court to take a decision,” Oyekanmi told reporters. Daily Trust reports that the PDP Presidential candidate, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, is making case for a forensic analysis of the INEC central server, which he claimed housed the presidential results that affirmed his victory at this year’s presidential election. The claim was however contradicted by INEC’s lawyer during a cross examination who said such server did not exist.
