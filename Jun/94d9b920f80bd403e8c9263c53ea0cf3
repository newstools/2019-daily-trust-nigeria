Senator Phillips Aduda  has distributed over 600 bags of rice and other food items to Federal Capital Territory (FCT) residents with a call for them and other Nigerians to live peacefully. The senator, representing the FCT in the National Assembly, in his Sallah message, emphasised the need for Nigerians irrespective of cultural or religious backgrounds to co-exist peacefully with everyone. Aduda, who made the call through his special adviser on Political Affairs, Abdulrahman Mohammed, noted that the celebration should remind everyone that God wants the existence of peace in mankind. He said meaningful development could only be achieved in a peaceful environment. “We are appealing to FCT residents and the entire Nigerians to embrace peace during this Salah celebration so that this country will continue to develop. Peace brings progress and development, that is why we are calling on all Muslims to emulate and practice the teachings of the Holy Prophet which is basically on love and unity,” he said. One of the beneficiaries, Hajiya Aishatu Usman, expressed appreciation for Senator Aduda’s gesture which, she said, he always gave during festive periods.
