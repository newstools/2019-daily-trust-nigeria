The immediate past governor of Oyo State, Senator Abiola Ajimobi, yesterday, said the sacked local government chairmen are on the right track because the law is on their side. He said he had been doing many things about the case of the dissolution of council chairmen since the new government in the state pronounced their dissolution, but he chose to be doing it silently. The former governor, who spoke at a special reception organised by an Ibadan-born industrialist, Chief Kola Daisi, urged the governorship candidate of the party in the last general elections, Chief Bayo Adelabu, to learn from his mistakes and prepare for future elections. Being his first appearance in public event since he lost his senatorial election in March this year, Ajimobi dismissed the general belief that the people of the state refused to vote for him because he had offended them. He said he had contested election five times in the state and won four times, which signified the support of the people of Ibadanland for him. Ajimobi described political parties as a vehicle to various destinations, noting that any vehicle could take politicians to their destinations, but “the most important thing is good governance.” Ekiti State: And democracy dies Rivers politics of councils’ dissolution Unending governors’ caretakers for local councils Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
