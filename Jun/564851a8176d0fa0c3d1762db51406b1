The Managing Director of Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO), Dr Jamilu Isyaku Gwamna, has said the company would embrace all the innovations needed to improve the future of power in Northern Nigeria. Gwamna during an interactive session at the sidelines of a workshop on power sector in Abuja recently said without detailed research power sector improvement may be minimal. A statement by the Head, Corporate Communications, Ibrahim Sani Shawai, said the on-going workshop whose participants were drawn from KEDCO and Kaduna Electric is organized by the School of International Futures (SOIF) and is scheduled to end on June 27, 2019. The workshop is with the theme: “How can Kaduna and KEDCO best thrive and prosper out to 2030, given Northern Nigeria’s complex and volatile environment, challenges of poverty and industrialization, and the dynamics of the power sector.’’ The KEDCO boss notes that the power sector holds the key to industrialization of Northern Nigeria and improvement of the living standard of the people. He said: “When power improves in this part of Nigeria, many challenges would go.” KEDCO@ 5: Achievements, challenges and future plans FG receives kudos for improved power generation KEDCO to help revive Kano industries Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
