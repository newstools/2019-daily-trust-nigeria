The West Africa Container Terminal (WACT), Onne Port in Rivers State said it is preparing to take delivery of two new mobile harbor cranes from Liebherr, as part of an unprecedented $10 million upgrade. The upgrade will bring WACT, which is not just the biggest but also the most efficient container terminal outside Lagos, at par with its peers in Apapa and Tin Can Island Ports, Lagos in terms of equipment and operational efficiency. The Managing Director of WACT, Mr. Aamir Mirza, while speaking during the commissioning of four new specialized terminal trucks and an empty handler in Onne on Friday, said the mobile harbor cranes are expected to arrive Nigeria in July this year. He also said that the acquisition of four additional specialized terminal trucks brings to 10 the number of such trucks acquired by WACT so far this year, with four more expected before the end of the year. “So far we have 10 terminal trucks and four are still coming on the way. We have 12 that we are already using in the past. So with this, we are going to have substantial number of trucks. The trucks are required to support the operations of the mobile harbor cranes because when compared to the current vessel cranes, the mobile harbour cranes operate at a faster rate,” he said.
