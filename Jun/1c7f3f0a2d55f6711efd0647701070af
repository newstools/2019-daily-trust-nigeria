The Vice President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Mr. Aristobulo Isturiz, has said the Venezuelan government is open and willing to sit with the United States of America to find a solution to the current crisis in the country. The Vice President who was in Nigeria for the June 12 Democracy Day celebration, made this known during a meeting hosted by the Venezuelan embassy at the National Labour House on Thursday. “We’re open to dialogue with the US and we are ready whenever they are to sit down and talk. That’s what we want. The only solution to this crisis is through dialogue,” the Vice President said. He also said the sanctions put on Venezuela’s financial assets surmounting to approximately $300 million, had put the country in a very difficult situation, making it difficult to purchase medicine, food and other basic amenities for its citizens, and also crippling the economy. “Venezuela has a lot of resources that the US has blocked us from getting access to. If only the US would lift the sanctions, there would be room for discussions,” he added. Vice President Isturiz also pleaded with Nigerians and people across the world to be wary with what is portrayed in the media about Venezuela, stating that there is a lot of manipulation of information and false news being spewed, most especially across social media.
