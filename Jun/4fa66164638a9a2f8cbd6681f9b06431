Adire/Kampala traders in Itoku market in Abeokuta South Local Government Area of Ogun State, have petitioned the State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, and the State House of Assembly, over alleged illegal allocation of shops at the newly constructed Adire mall shopping complex. The aggrieved traders, numbering 169, protested the alleged illegal allocation of shops at the mall and forcefully shut it; following believe that the mall’s occupants are loyalists of the former Governor of the state, Ibikunle Amosun. The traders vowed to resist the opening of the mall until the alleged lopsidedness and injustice in the allocation of the shops are addressed by Abiodun’s government. The traders in the petition which was written through their legal adviser, Idowu Adepeju and Co, accused the former governor of given the newly constructed mall to people that were not traders at the market whose shops were demolished. The traders further alleged that a sum of N10,000 was paid to obtain a form from the past government as a requirement for allocation  of shops. They, however, called on the governor and the leadership of the State Assembly to review the allocation made by the immediate past government. “The purported allottees were allotted four shops each, and they were not traders at all, and they were not known in the market, while my clients (169 Kampala traders in Itoku market) were not allowed any shop at all.  Whereas, the same Amosun-led administration collected the sum of N10,000  from each of my clients”, he said.
