The Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has issued an Approved Maintenance Organization (AMO) certificate on Non Destructive Testing (NDT) to DAV-AAKY Nigeria Limited, an indigenous company based in Lagos. The certification enables the AMO to carry out NDT inspection to ensure airworthiness and serviceability of aircraft. The firm, with AMO/5N/DAV, is the first of its kind in Nigeria. The company is now approved to inspect and carry out NDT on aircraft and aircraft components with specifications covering Eddy Current Testing, Magnetic Testing, Dye Penetrant and Ultrasonic Testing inspection on all types of aircraft and aircraft components. Chief Executive Officer of DAV-AAKY, Ayoola Stephen, said the NDT tests are carried out on aircraft whole or components to detect cracks, corrosion, among others on the aircraft or aircraft components. He also added that the company has trained and competent NDT personnel with certification to EN4179 and/or NAS410 which is internationally recognized. Stephen decried the dearth of NDT personnel in the country, adding that with the certification given to the company, more professionals would be trained in the specialized field. “It’s not easy, but we will be the first leading NDT in this country and we would train no fewer than 500 staff on NDT to employ a lot of people in the years to come. NDT professionals are no more than 20 well trained in this country and this is sad. I want to see that in the next five – 10 years, we will be having over 500 or 1000 people,” he said.
