Namibia’s economy will mildly contract again in 2019 due to poor rains and reduced diamond production but economic growth will return in 2020, the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday. Namibia’s central bank had said in April that economic growth would be about 0.3% in 2019 after contractions in 2018 and 2017. The IMF did not give precise figures in its statement. “Downside risks to this outlook include lower than expected Southern African Customs Union revenue and fiscal slippages that would undermine the government’s efforts to stabilize public debt dynamics,” Geremia Palomba, the IMF mission chief for Namibia, said in the statement. Namibia’s growth was expected to gradually converge to a long-term rate of about three per cent, held back by low productivity and declining competitiveness, he added.
