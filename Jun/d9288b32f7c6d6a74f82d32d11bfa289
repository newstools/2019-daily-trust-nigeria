One person has been killed and scores injured following a clash between two groups of thugs at the annual Hawan Daushe durbar in Kano State. Confirming the death, the Police Public Relation Officer, DSP Haruna Abdullahi, said the corpse of the deceased had been deposited at the morgue of Murtala Muhammed Specialist Hospital. Abdullahi also confirmed that six injured persons were taken to hospital for treatment, while six suspects were arrested. Daily Trust gathered that fight erupted between the two groups, locally known as Yandaba, towards the end of the annual durbar, with many spectators caught up in the skirmishes. A witness told Daily Trust that “The Yandaba descended on the spectators, stabbing people indiscriminately. They injured several people before the police deployed re-enforcement to the venue of the event. “The thugs did not spare anybody including women and minors during the attack. It was unfortunate that the peaceful and colourful event was marred by violence.” How Ganduje, Kwankwaso’s supporters turned Kano emir’s palace battle ground How Ganduje, Kwankwaso’s supporters turned Kano emir’s palace battle ground How Ganduje, Kwankwaso’s supporters turned Kano emir’s palace battle ground Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
