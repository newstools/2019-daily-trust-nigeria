No nation can achieve industrialisation without taking advantage of its mineral wealth, the new president of the Nigerian Mining and Geoscience Society (NMGS), Engineer Obadiah S. Nkom, has said. Nkom was speaking at a press conference preceding his investiture as the president of the society in Abuja recently. “There is no nation that can achieve industrialisation without taking advantage of its mineral wealth.
