Senate President Ahmad Lawan yesterday swore in the immediate past governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, as the senator representing Imo West. Okorocha was on Tuesday issued his certificate of return by INEC following over two months of foot-dragging. The electoral umpire had said Okorocha was declared winner of the election that held on February 23 under duress. But a Federal High court in Abuja on Monday ruled that INEC had no power to withhold Okorocha’s return certificate. The court therefore ordered that the electoral umpire should immediately issue the certificate of return to Okorocha. Okorocha later told journalists at a briefing that during his stay in the Senate, he would serve as a bridge between the Eastern part and other parts of the country. He said he would also be an advocate for free education for the Nigerian children and support initiatives by the 9th Senate to work with the Executive arm on insecurity.
