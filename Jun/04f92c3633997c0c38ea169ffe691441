Spokesman to Bauchi State governor, Dr Ladan Salihu, has said the speaker of the State House of Assembly, Abubakar Suleiman Ningi, was legitimately elected by the members. He disclosed this while reacting to claims by the opposition APC that his election was null and void as well as the alleged use of security agents to harass lawmakers on the inauguration day. Ladan said the election of the Speaker was conducted and pronounced, adding that he delivered his acceptance speech, just as the same process was followed for the election of the deputy Speaker, Danlami Ahmed Kawule of the PDP. He also absolved Governor Bala Mohammed of any wrongdoing on what happened on the inauguration day as alleged by the opposition party, APC, saying, the governor is a democrat and a parliamentarian who knows the rules. He explained that he decided to speak on the State House of Assembly issue because it has not appointed a spokesman and had adjourned sitting indefinitely. ‘Bauchi Speaker legitimately elected,’ says Governor's aide Bauchi: A story of 1 House, 2 Speakers Bauchi gov, predecessor disagree over assembly inauguration Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
