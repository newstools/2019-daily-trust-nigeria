Director General of the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) Barrister Osita Aboloma says with SON Act 2015, stricter penalty now awaits manufacturers of substandard products. Aboloma spoke just as the Ekiti State Coordinator, Ayeni  Feyisayo, expressed concern that alongside losing lives and billions of properties, Nigeria’s integrity is being tainted by producers of substandard goods. They spoke in Sagamu, Ogun State at a one-day sensitization on sub-standard goods/products in the South West Zone. Aboloma, who was represented by the Regional Coordinator, South West Operations, Mrs Tosan Akin-Akosile, told participants that unlike in the past, any producer found culpable of substandard goods could incur N20 million fine or imprisonment. The DG also blamed porous borders for influx of substandard goods into the country. “When something is sub-standard, it is then said not to be of good quality.  Quality is to the user fitness for use and not conformance to specification. The ultimate user seldom knows what is in the specifications,“ Feyisayo said. SON Coordinator, Ogun State office II, Engr Onipede Olanrewaju, disclosed that plans are in top gear to sensitize manufacturers in the state on the SON Act 2015 which spells out stiffer penalty, as part of moves to curb production of substandard goods in the state.
