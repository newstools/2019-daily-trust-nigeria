A 48-year-old plumber, Kolawole Apoti, who allegedly had carnal knowledge of three minors, has been remanded in Olokuta prison by an Akure Chief Magistrate Court. The accused was brought before Magistrate Mrs. Charles Adeyanju, on a three count-charge of assault, indecent touch and rape. The Police Prosecutor, Inspector Uloh Goodluck, told the court that the accused committed the offence sometime in September, 2018, in Akure. Goodluck said the accused unlawfully and indecently assaulted a 14-year-old and two girls aged 11, by pressing their breasts, touching their private parts and having carnal knowledge of them. The accused was alleged to be using handkerchief to clean the private part of any minor he molested with the intention to use it for rituals. The alleged offence is punishable under section 221(30 and 360 of the criminal code cap 37 vol 1), Laws of Ondo State of Nigeria, 2006. But the plea of the accused was not taken. Goodluck, therefore, prayed the court to remand the accused in prison custody pending the legal advice from the Director of Public prosecution (DPP). Lawyer to the accused, Mrs. O.O. Adedire, did not oppose the remand application made by the prosecutor. Magistrate Mrs. Charles Adeyanju, ordered the remand of the accused in prison custody pending the advice from the DPPâ€™s office. The case was adjourned to October 2, 2019.  57-year-old man jailed for defiling minor 32-year-old fake military captain arraigned When teachers prey on their students Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
