Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State has admitted that it’s not a tea party to govern the state. Speaking to State House correspondents in Abuja yesterday, he said the challenges in Lagos State were real, and had made him lose weight. “The experience is real, it got to show that the challenges are real, they are there, it’s not a tea party.  You don’t sleep and wake up and the traffic has gone down, you don’t sleep and wake up and there is no rain and that you’ve resolved Apapa gridlock, it’s real. He said: “So it’s something that has psychologically prepared one for. The best thing to do is to ensure that you are not about looking for what the other person did, but it’s for Lagosians to see you do what you said you are going to do for them.”  In just 1 week, I have lost weight governing Lagos—Sanwo-Olu Lagos needs regeneration to tackle building collapse – Gov-elect We’ll proffer solutions to Lagos problems without delay, says Sanwo-Olu Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
