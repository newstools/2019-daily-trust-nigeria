Fowl sellers in Damaturu, Yobe State capital, have increased prices of chickens, turkey, and guinea fowls ahead of Eid-Al-Fitr celebration. The development, happening barely a day to Eid-Al-Fitr celebration, had attracted low patronage of the birds by the Muslim faithfuls. Our correspondent, who went round markets within the state capital, reported that a local chicken, sold at N1500 few days ago, was now being sold for between N2500 to N2800, while a turkey that costs N8000 is now between N10,000 to N11,000. One of the sellers, Musa Danfillo, said that scarcity was the reason for the rising cost of the birds. “We have not gotten broilers supplies from our dealers in Kano, Bauchi and Jos. That is why the price of the local chickens skyrocketed”. A buyer, Ismaila Lawan, blamed the sellers for taking advantage of the Sallah celebration to increase the price. “Many buyers now prefers to travel to Potiskum and other villages to buy their chickens at a very low cost. You can get a bird that is sold N2500 at N1200 in Potiskum or other villages”, he said.
