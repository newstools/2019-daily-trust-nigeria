The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has implored Muslims to continue to imbibe the spirit, virtues and lessons of Ramadan which include sacrifice, modesty and discipline in rededicating themselves to the task of nation-building. The APC National Publicity Secretary, Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, in a goodwill message on Tuesday to commemorate this yearâ€™s Eid-el-Fitr, rejoiced with all Muslim faithful and all Nigerians for the successful completion of the month-long fasting. Issa-Onilu also admonished Muslims and non-Muslims to cultivate the virtues of tolerance in their relationship with fellow Nigerians and shun all divisive acts and tendencies capable of destabilising the country. He asked all Nigerians to remain vigilant and security conscious and report suspicious activity around them to the relevant security agencies in the wake of security challenges such as terrorism, armed banditry and kidnapping. He said the President Muhammadu Buhari-led APC administration held the protection of lives and property of every Nigerian sacrosanct and would not relent in swiftly dealing with real and perceived threats in any part of the country. The APC also urged all Nigerians to continue to pray for the peace, progress, stability and prosperity of the country and grant leaders at all levels the wisdom to successfully steer the ship of this great nation.
