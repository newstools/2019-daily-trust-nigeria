The Supreme Court has dismissed a petition seeking to nullify the election of Senator Aishatu Dahiru Ahmed (Binani) for the Adamawa Central Senatorial District. A five-member panel of justices unanimously dismissed the appeal by an aspirant, Abubakar Waziri after he withdrew same. In the ruling, the panel presided by Justice Mary Odili held that “appeal having been withdrawn is hereby dismissed.” Waziri had brought the appeal challenging the October 2018 primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on the grounds that Aishatu Ahmed was not qualified to contest the election. In the appeal by his counsel, Muritala Abdulrasheed, Waziri claimed that the party failed to give the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) 21 days notice before conducting the primary as provided by law, which makes it ultra vires the party’s powers. But counsel to Aishatu, Sam Ologun-Orisa(SAN) faulted the appellant for wasting the time of the court.
