Security agents in Plateau State yesterday recovered the corpse of a 22-year-old man who was decapitated and dumped in a shallow grave in Furaka, Jos North Local Government Area, less than three weeks after the decapitation of another youth sparked crisis in the area. Our correspondent reports that Furaka, Cele Bridge, Dutse Uku, Unguwan Damisa and Rikkos went into commotion late last month when the decapitated body of one Enoch Monday was recovered from Anguwan Damisa. The incident led to reprisals that took the form of religious crisis which security agents said claimed six lives with many houses burnt. However, yesterday, security agents also recovered the remains of Mislihu Yakubu, whom, eyewitness claimed, had been decapitated. The body moved to the Plateau Specialist Hospital before it was later released to relatives for burial. The Commissioner of Police, Isaac Akinmoyede, confirmed the incident, but said the command was in search of two suspects alleged to have carried out the attack.
