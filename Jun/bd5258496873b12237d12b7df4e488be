A chieftain of the APC in Bayelsa State, Mr Warman Ogoriba, has said the immediate past Minister of State for Agriculture, Senator Heineken Lokpobiri, will be the best candidate for the party in the forthcoming governorship election in the state. Ogoriba, who is also the Director General of Senator Lokpobiri Campaign Organisation, told journalists in Yenagoa, that without choosing the right candidate, APC would find it difficult to win the next gubernatorial election. He described the former minister as a focused leader who had the capabilities to deliver in Bayelsa. “The senator, having served as the speaker of Bayelsa Assembly, a national legislator and minister in Buhari’s government, has garnered enough experience to lead the state to an enviable height.” “Bayelsa needs a good person to rule as governor; someone that can work for the good interest of the people and bring development,” he added.
