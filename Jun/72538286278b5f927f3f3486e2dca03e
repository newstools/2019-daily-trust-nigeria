The Rano Emirate Council in Kano state has queried four district heads over alleged insubordination. The district heads are those of Doguwa Local Government, Alhaji Aliyu Harazimi, Kura, Alhaji Bello Ado Bayero; Garun Malam, Alhaji Abubakar Gwadabe Buhari and Takai, Alhaji Lamido Danburan Haruna. The queries dated June 17 were signed by  the Secretary of Rano Emirate Council, Muhammad Idris Rano. The query letters indicated that the four district heads were presented with invitation letters last month directing them to pay homage to the emir during Ramadan fast breaking and also to participate in the last Sallah durbar held  at the emir’s place. The district heads were requested to reply within 24 hours why disciplinary action would not be taken against them.
