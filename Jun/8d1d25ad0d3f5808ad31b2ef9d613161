The Presidential Election Petitions Tribunal has concluded pre-hearing proceedings in the petition by the Peoples Democratic Movement (PDM) and its presidential candidate, Aminchi Habu, challenging the February 23 presidential election. The chairman of the five-member tribunal, Justice Mohammed Garba, said in view of the conclusion of preliminary issues in the petition, the panel will on July 10 present its pre-hearing report to the public, which will signal beginning of the main hearing in the petition. However, PDM and Habu’s counsel, Aliyu Lema Esq, told the tribunal that they would require one day to prove their case against the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and President Muhammadu Buhari. He said they would call two witnesses and reserve the right to call a witness from INEC during the main trial. On his part, INEC counsel, Yunus Ustaz Usman (SAN) said the commission would need one day to defend its case and two witnesses. Buhari’s counsel, Alex Izinyon (SAN) pleaded for two days to defend the petition by the PDM. He said the president would call three witnesses. Also, the APC, through its counsel, Niyi Akintola (SAN) pleaded for three days to defend the petition. The party said it has four categories of witnesses to call with a yet-to-be determined number. PDM and Habu brought the petition challenging their exclusion from participating in the February 23 presidential election brought under Section 138 of the Electoral Act, 2010, which holds that the election would be nullified where “a candidate was validly nominated but unlawfully excluded”.
