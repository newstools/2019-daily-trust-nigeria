The entry of Ibom Air, the airline belonging to Akwa Ibom State Government, has deepened flight competition on the Lagos-Uyo and Abuja-Uyo routes, Daily Trust reports. Ibom Air started domestic flight operations on Friday last week, joining four other airlines operating into the state capital. Already, four airlines – Air Peace, Arik Air, Dana and Aero Contractors – operate on the route. But Ibom Air started with a lower fare of N15,000 for Lagos to Uyo or Abuja to Uyo when other airlines charge N21,000 to N27,000. It was learnt that the introductory fare may last for a few weeks before it would be adjusted in line with the current realities and for profitability. An airline source said the entry of Ibom Air into the Uyo route has provided more travel options for frequent fliers on the route. Speaking in Lagos during the inaugural flight of the airline into the Murtala Muhammed Airport terminal two (MMA2), the Chief Operating Officer of Ibom Air, Mr. George Uriesi said, “We will settle in the country and after a while we will go into the region. We want to model ourselves around Comair of South Africa. They have been in existence for about 75 years and profitable for 72 years.” He said the airline would invest on the cost effective Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft. “We are going to have the biggest CRJ900 on the continent. The fourth one will come in August. Against numbers, the fifth aero plane comes in the first quarter of 2020,” he added.
