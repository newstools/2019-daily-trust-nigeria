A political party, We The People of Nigeria (WTPN), has established a Non- Governmental Organization (NGO) to fight corruption in Nigeria. The NGO, known as People Grassroots Association for Corruption – free Nigeria, was launched by the national chairman of the party, Prof. Peter Nwagwu. The chairman who made this known to newsmen urged Nigerians to sit up to the challenges of bad governance and criticize policies inimical to the development of the grassroots. Nwangwu said the project will offer Nigerians a platform to unite and take their country back after alleged mutilation by inept and corrupt politicians. “Unlike these parties, we are focused and have a solid foundation that will carry our work eminently permanently,” he stated. He said the current poverty in Nigeria had reduced the country to the status of the poverty capital of the world and lamented that the current administration had not offered much towards reducing the poverty in the country.
