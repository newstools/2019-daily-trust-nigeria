A group under the aegis of Coalition of Concerned Citizens of Sokoto state has criticized the recent N27.1 billion loan sought by the state governor, Aminu Waziiri Tambuwal. In a statement in Sokoto, the coordinator of the group, retired Squadron Leader, Aminu Bala Sokoto, said the action of the governor in seeking the approval of the State House of Assembly, on 31st May, 2019, to secure N27.1 billion loans from some commercial banks, was condemnable. He queried: “What  is the governor  going to use this whopping amount of money for, while the implementation of the state’s 2019 budget, amounting to N169.652 billion, is yet to fully commence.” “It is a treacherous breach of the trust the people of the state have reposed in him,” he alleged. Bala noted that the State Legislature had on 24th December, 2018, given the governor another approval to take a loan of N5.1billion. “Therefore, from 24th December 2018, to 31st May 2019, a period of five months, Governor Tambuwal was given the approval to take a total loan of N32.2 billion,” he pointed out. According to him, “the crux of the condemnation and the major contention is largely about the motive and the objectives of these loans.” Tambuwal budgets N169.6bn for 2019 fiscal year Sokoto in 2018 Pressure mounts on Governor Tambuwal to resign Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
