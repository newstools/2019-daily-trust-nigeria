Some small and micro business entrepreneurs (SMEs) across the country have lauded Jumia for providing its platform to help their businesses achieve significant growth. This was revealed at the quarterly vendors’ board meeting with top management staff of the e-commerce company held in Lagos recently. The meeting was organised to brainstorm on and identify untapped growth potential that sellers on the platform could leverage on to grow their businesses. Speaking at the event, the Chief Executive Officer of Jumia Nigeria, Mrs Juliet Anammah, urged the sellers to constantly ensure they list top quality products and manage their inventory to avoid out of stock and automatic cancellation which affects their “seller score”. She noted that sellers with the highest scores attract more orders from customers. Also speaking, the Chief Operating Officer of Jumia Nigeria, Susan Chen, urged the sellers to leverage some of the big sales event organised by the company. She said Jumia Anniversary, Black Friday, and Mobile Week, among others are some of the commercial events that can aid the sellers in growing their businesses three times more, if they enthusiastically take advantage of the sales events.
