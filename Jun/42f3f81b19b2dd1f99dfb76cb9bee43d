Candidate of the PDP for the February 23 election, Atiku Abubakar, has said the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal did not reject his request to check INEC server as claimed by the Presidency. Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant on Media to President Muhammadu Buhari, in a statement, Monday, praised what he called a “landmark ruling” of the tribunal which “rejected” the request by Atiku and the PDP to have access to INEC server used for the 2019 presidential election. But Atiku in a statement, yesterday, by his Special Adviser on Media, Paul Ibe, argued that “what the honourable tribunal said is that it is still at preliminary stages and the main case has not begun; and that the matter of granting access to inspect the INEC server is not relevant to the preliminary stages,” he said.
