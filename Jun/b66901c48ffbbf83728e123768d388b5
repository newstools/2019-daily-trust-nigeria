Irate youths have blocked the Ijaw National Council (INC) election accreditation venue and prevented delegates gaining access to election venue. The youths, believed to be sponsored by politicians, are trying to obstruct the election from holding today. The INC is the highest socio-cultural organization in Ijaw land, and delegates from Rivers, Bayelsa, Akwa Ibom, Edo, Ondo, Delta and other states where Ijaw groups are found, gathered in Yenagoa since yesterday to elect their leaders. It was gathered that the delegates were determined to elect an independent candidate, different from Bayelsa State-sponsored ones, to pilot the affairs of the organization. As at the time of filing this report, several delegates were still being blocked at Gabriel Okara Cultural Centre, where accreditation took place, from being conveyed to Ijaw House for the main election. Meanwhile, security agencies are trying to contain the irate youths from accessing the main complex. 31 aspirants jostle for Ijaw National Council election Why I backed Southern Ijaw re-run poll - Dickson The farce that was APC governorship primary in Bayelsa Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
