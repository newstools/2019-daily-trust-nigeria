Senator Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko representing Sokoto North Senatorial District, said yesterday that he is not gunning for any leadership position in the Senate because he is not interested. “I don’t have any interest to contest any of such positions and this remains so,” Senator Wamakko asserted. There were newspaper reports that Senator Wamakko was in the race for the position of Senate Leader. But a statement by the senator’s Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Bashir Rabe Mani, said he was not contesting for the position of Senate leader or any leadership position in the Senate in the 9th Assembly. According to him, the reports published by some national dailies on Sunday, June 16, enumerating his name as one of those gunning for the position of the Senate leadership was not in any way true.
