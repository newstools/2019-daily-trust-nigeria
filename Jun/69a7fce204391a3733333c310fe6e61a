The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said it would obey the judgment of the Federal High Court, Abuja, presided over by the Hon. Justice Okon Abang, which directed it to issue a Certificate of Return to Rochas Okorocha as the Senator-elect for Imo West Senatorial District. The National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, who disclosed this in a statement yesterday, said the commission was also aware of and had been served the order of a High Court of Imo State presided over by Justice Njemanze directing it not to issue a Certificate of Return to any of the candidates that contested the Imo West Senatorial District election. “The commission is currently undertaking state level reviews of the 2019 general elections and all the national commissioners are either in or heading to their states of supervision to coordinate activities relating to the said review. In view of the import and directives of the said judgement, the commission will meet as soon as practicable to do the needful. As a law-abiding institution, the commission will continue to obey judgments of all courts of competent jurisdiction,” Okoye said.
