The Kano State Government has set up a committee to review the report of the alleged misappropriation of N3.4bn by the Kano Emirate Council by the State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission. A source at the Kano Government House told Daily Trust yesterday that the committee was inaugurated on Friday and directed to start its work with immediate effect. According to source, the governor has succumbed to the pressure by some individuals from within and outside government to allow the process work properly. “With this development, the anti-corruption can go ahead with its investigation and probably its investigation may lead to suspension of the emir as earlier requested by the commission. “From all indications, government is not satisfied with emir’s response to the query he was issued with, hence the setting up of the committee,” said the source.
