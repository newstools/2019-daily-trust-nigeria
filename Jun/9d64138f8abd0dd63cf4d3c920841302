Ogun State House of Assembly yesterday asked security agencies to ensure sanity by checking illegal use of number plates and siren in the state. The resolution followed a motion by a member, representing Ogun Waterside State Constituency, Hon. Akeem Balogun, seconded by his Sagamu II counterpart, Hon. Ademola Adeniran. Speaking on the motion, two lawmakers – Adegoke Adeyanju and Oludaisi Elemide, submitted that it has become imperative for security agencies to checkmate illegal use of official number plates by unauthorized persons, particularly, ex-political office holders. The lawmakers added that unlawful use of siren and the coverage of number plates could be used to perpetrate crimes in the society.
