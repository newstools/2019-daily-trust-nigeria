A former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie Oyegun, has said that the party may lose Edo State during the 2020 governorship election in the state if it failed to resolve the crisis in the party. Oyegun said this on Wednesday in Benin while reacting to the leadship crisis rocking the Edo state House of Assembly. The Clerk of the House, Yahaya Omogbai, had, during the inauguration of the house on Monday, sworn-in nine members out of the 24 members-elect. The House also elected Hon. Frank Okiye, representing Esan North East I, as speaker and Frank Idiaye as deputy speaker. Oyegun, who spoke to our reporter on phone, described the crisis rocking the Assembly as the handy work of political godfather. “Godfather is at work. That is all I can say. “All that I know is that APC can easily lose Edo State to opposition party if they are not careful. So, it is in the interest of all stakeholders in the party to work together to settle the rift.” He added that, “I will advise members of the party, especially party leaders, to be very careful and settle the crisis because they can easily lose the state.” Atiku, Tinubu  consider plan ‘B’ N/Assembly crisis: Frank demands Oyegun’s resignation Edo 2020: Issues as fight over ticket gets messier Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
