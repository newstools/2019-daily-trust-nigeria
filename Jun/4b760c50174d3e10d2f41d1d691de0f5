A middle-aged man has died three days after stealing an antiquity (idol) from a Tiv community in Taraba state. The middle aged man, it was gathered, went to Tiv community which was affected by the ongoing Tiv/Jukun crisis to loot and took away the antiquity kept in a shrine. The man, Daily Trust further learnt, after stealing the object brought it to his room secretly without informing his co-looters what he had stolen. A source in Wukari, Shamaki Solomon, told Daily Trust that the man could not sleep the day he stole the antiquity. The source told Daily Trust that the antiquity which is a deity in the community was used for protection by traditionalists in the village. The man, according to the Solomon, had later confessed that he heard a loud  sound in his room saying ‘l  need blood to drink’, saying the sound came from the position where he kept the antiquity. According to the source, the man after hearing the sound, could not sleep for three days. Solomon stated that the man became sick, lost his senses and died later. On what happens with the antiquity, the source said everyone was afraid to touch the antiquity which the victim hid in a bag. When contacted, Police spokesman in Taraba state, DSP David Misal, said the matter was not reported to the police command.
