Kwara State Government has postponed activities commemorating the June 12 Democracy Day in the state to Friday June 14. According to a statement by the chief press secretary to the governor, Rafiu Ajakaiye, the postponement will enable State Governors, including Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, on the invitation of the Federal Government, to join Mr President and over 80 foreign leaders and dignitaries at the inaugural national commemoration of the day in the capital city, Abuja. The statement reads: “What this means is that the event slated for the Metropolitan Square and State Banquet in Ilorin will now hold on Friday 14th June instead of Wednesday June 12. “Kwara will nonetheless observe the national holiday slated for June 12 as earlier announced by the Federal Government. There will be no new holiday on Friday.” The statement noted that many other states are also changing their own schedule of the event in order to join President Muhammadu Buhari for the inaugural June 12 commemoration in Abuja. “We urge the Kwara public and all invitees (from outside Kwara) to the events in Kwara state to please take note of this slight change in the schedule,” it added.
