GlaxoSmithkline (GSK) Consumer Nigeria PLC has said it will continue to identify the administrators of the unclaimed dividends, especially those belonging to deceased shareholders to clear out the outstanding N1.5 billion. The Chairman of GSK, Mr. Edmund Onuzo, stated this during the 48th Annual General Meeting (AGM) held over the weekend while fielding questions raised by shareholders over the backlog of unclaimed dividends. Onuzo said: “I did simple arithmetic, I found the chunk of money belonging to estates of six deceased shareholders. We are talking of N450m unclaimed dividend. We do hope that the effort will continue and whosoever are there administrators will claim.” According to GSK’s 2018 financial report, the organisation had a backlog of N1.5b unclaimed dividend in respect of payments to 31 to 42 of the shareholders of GSK Consumer Nigeria PLC and its legacy companies. For 2018, the chairman said the proposed dividend totaling N597m representing 50 kobo per share would be shared to the shareholders. Declaring the turnover of the year 2018, he said it grew by 14 per cent against 2017 to close at N18.4b, while the gross profit grew by 51 per cent to close at N6.7b.
