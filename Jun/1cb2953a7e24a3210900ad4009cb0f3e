The chairman of Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), Abdullahi Adamu Candido, has performed the foundation laying ceremony of the AMAC School for the Gifted, ICT and Innovation Centre in Unguwar Hakimi, Orozo, with a call on youths to pursue entrepreneurship instead of white-collar jobs. “In the next two or three months, we should have this school ready in physical form. Then we shall encourage private partnership,” he said. He urged residents not to waste the opportunity but to fully tap into it by enrolling their children while graduates and secondary school leavers could also take advantage of the ICT and innovation centre to acquire a skill. “The idea behind this institution was borne out of the desire to ensure that our youths don’t wait for a white collar job.  An idle mind is the devil’s workshop; we are trying to make sure that we don’t allow any mind to be idle. You don’t necessarily need to wait for government jobs,” he said. He said the government might need to bring talented children from all the wards in the council so that their talents could be well nurtured.
