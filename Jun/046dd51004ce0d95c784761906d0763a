Some youths in Wukari town, Taraba state have sacked a Police divisional office and freed three suspected gun manufacturers arrested by the police. Daily Trust gathered that the three suspects were arrested in Wukari town on Sunday for allegedly manufacturing guns by a team of security men from Jalingo and brought to the Divisional Police Office for safe-keeping. It was gathered that the security men were making arrangement to move the suspects to Jalingo when the youths stormed the station and freed the suspects. A witness who will not like his name to be mentioned told Daily Trust in a telephone interview that the youths sacked the police station, beat up police men on duty and forcefully freed the three suspects. It would be recalled that the police area command in the town was also burnt by the youths in the town during the 2013 religious crisis. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer of the state command, DSP David Misal, said the incident was not reported to the command but promised to contact Wukari division to find out. “Still waiting for details from DPO, please,” the police spokesman said in a text message to our reporter hours later. 138 youths nabbed over illegal recruitment No Boko Haram in Enugu -Police Gunmen kill 14 in Fulani villages in Taraba Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
