Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State yesterday met  the leadership of the state APC stakeholders Forum led by Senator Alex Kadiri. Sen Kadiri, who is the Chairman of the Forum, said the interactive session at the Kogi state liaison, Asokoro, Abuja, was at the instance of the governor. He said Governor Bello harped on the need for reconciliation in the Kogi state chapter of the party and for the unity amongst members. He urged both sides in the protracted party dispute to resolve their differences and move forward as one united political party. Speaking on behalf of the Kogi State Stakeholders’ Forum, Senator Kadiri made two demands: “First, that the state government should take steps to pay outstanding salaries and pension to workers and pensioners respectively so as to cushion the prolonged hardship they have been experiencing in the state. “Secondly, Dr Kadiri drew the attention of the governor to the non-implementation of the reports of the two reconciliatory committees led separately by Prince Tony Momoh and General Garba (Rtd), set up by Chief John Odigie Oyegun, the former National Chairman of the party.” He also reminded the Governor that the resolutions reached during the interactive session with Vice-President Yemi Osibanjo before the last general elections remained unimplemented. He therefore urged the governor to take time to read these reports as a basis for further genuine reconciliatory discussion.
