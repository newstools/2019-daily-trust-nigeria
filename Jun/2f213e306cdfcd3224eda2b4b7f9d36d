The Managing Director, Growth & Development Asset Management Limited (GDL), Mr. Kola Ayeye, has tasked the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and commercial banks to collaborate with the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) to convert the power sector loans to equity. He said it was time to recommend a new programme where NERC, CBN and banks can invite global players like General Electric to commit to generate, transmit and distribute 20,000 Megawatt (MW) daily in five years, and rising to 30,000MW in 10 years. Speaking at an interactive forum in Lagos, Mr. Ayeye, a former Executive Director of Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON), decried the level of default of both Generation Companies (GenCos) and Distribution Companies (DisCos) to banks. He said such entities should be put up for reconcessioning/reprivatisation either through voluntary collaboration with CBN/NERC/banks or through receivership where the operator refuses to cooperate. “Current operators should be compelled to either liquidate their debts or participate in a better managed programme of ceding management and control to a best-in-class operator. “However, the CBN, banks and NERC should initiate a programme of using these debts as a basis for re-concessioning underperforming operators to a world class operator,” he advised.
