The Chairman of the Northern Senators Forum (NSF), Senator Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko, has described the recent Supreme Court verdict on the 2019 elections in Zamfara State that edged out the APC as a trial from God. The court voided all the votes cast for the APC, while opposition party candidates for governorship, national and state assembly seats were subsequently declared as winners of the elections. Sen. Wamakko said, “It is, however, a trial from the Almighty Allah and we will Insha Allahu pass this divine test.” The senator’s Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Bashir Rabe Mani, said Wamakko said this when he led a high-powered delegation on a solidarity visit to the former Zamfara State Governor, Alhaji Abdulaziz Yari Abubakar, and APC members in the state over the court judgement. Sen. Wamakko noted that Zamfara and Sokoto were one and the same family, pointing out that “whatever affects one, directly affects the other.” He added that, “This is a brotherly visit to commiserate with you and the entire leadership, as well as the membership of APC in the state.” On his part, Yari was quoted as saying the Supreme Court judgement was predestined by God, who he said never made mistake.
