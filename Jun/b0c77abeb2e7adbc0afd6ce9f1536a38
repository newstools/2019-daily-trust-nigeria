The Supreme Court has affirmed the nomination of Abba Kabir-Yusuf as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate for the March 10 governorship election in Kano state. A seven-member panel of justices presided by Justice Bode Rhodes-Vivour yesterday unanimously held that the appeal lacked merit and dismissed same. The apex court upheld the decisions of the Court of Appeal in Kaduna which in March held that Yusuf was not joined as a party in the suit by a contestant for the governorship ticket, Ibrahim Ali-Amin. Ali-Amin had challenged the nomination of Kabir-Yusuf, also known as ‘Abba Gida Gida’ at a Federal High Court in Kano, arguing that the PDP failed to conduct a proper primary in October 2018. The court granted the relief sought by Ali-Amin and ordered a fresh primary election be conducted by the PDP. But the appellate court set aside the decision of the high court and held that Yusuf was not joined in the suit.
