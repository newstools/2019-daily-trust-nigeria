Suspected kidnappers have shot the manager of Bank of Agriculture, Jalingo branch, in Taraba state, Alhaji Muhammed Umar, at Yagai area  in Jalingo and abducted his wife, Rukayya, despite the curfew imposed on the town by the state governor, Darius Ishaku. Daily Trust gathered that the kidnappers numbering about ten stormed the residence of the bank manager located in Yagai area on Sunday midnight. It was gathered that the kidnappers who were armed forced their way into the manager’s bedroom and shot him on the stomach and took his wife away. The other two wives who were also in the house raised alarm but nobody came to their rescue until the kidnappers had left.
