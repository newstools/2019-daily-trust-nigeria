The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration Control (NAFDAC) has shut down an unregistered honey packaging company in Abuja. A statement by the agency’s Director General, Prof. Moji Adeyeye, issued to newsmen in Abuja, said they acted on information on social media, which led to the discovery of the unregulated company. She said the company, which is located at Durumi, Abuja, was  producing  adulterated honey. She said a customer who bought the product from a supermarket alleged in a social media post that the product was adulterated. According to her, when the agency tested the product, which was initially registered with it, it was confirmed that it had become unwholesome and unfit for consumption. “Investigation later revealed that the company started producing under poor hygiene, while the facility also added some unregistered variants of products that were never presented to NAFDAC,” she said. “Some of the products were found to have fake NAFDAC registration numbers printed on them,” she added. The NAFDAC director general said several samples of the products had been analysed and the results showed that many of them were unsatisfactory and may pose danger to the health of the people. She said stringent measures were still being taken to ensure that the company complied with the relevant NAFDAC guidelines and regulations. She assuring the general public that efforts were continually on to ensure safety, quality and wholesomeness of processed foods through regular routine monitoring of production.
