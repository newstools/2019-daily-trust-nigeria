Four people, including a security agent attached to Operation Safe Haven, have been confirmed dead in an attack on Kangboro village in Riyom Local Government Area of Plateau State. The Commissioner of Police, Isaac Akinmoyede, yesterday said the attack occurred Monday afternoon and that his command and men of Operation Safe Haven had rushed to the community where they exchanged gunshots with the assailants. He said: “We exchanged fire with the attackers as they climbed a hill and during that, an STF personnel was shot and killed. But we were able to wade off the attackers.” He said three additional corpses were recovered at the base of the hill yesterday; while over 30 houses were set ablaze. The CP called on the people to remain calm as security agents were patrolling the area. A member of the community said men of the vigilante had initially tried to resist the attackers, but were overpowered by their numbers. He also said a government primary health centre used by the villagers was raised down and many people displaced.
