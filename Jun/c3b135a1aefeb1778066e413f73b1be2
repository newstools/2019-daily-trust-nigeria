Imo state House of Assembly on Monday began the process of inventory and recovery of properties allegedly stolen by the former administration. The speaker, Chiji Collins, who spoke to journalists in Owerri after the lawmakers inspected facilities belonging to the Assembly, said apart from the complex being in a dilapidated state, the lawmakers had set up a committee to begin the recovery of stolen state government properties. Collins, who decried the poor state of the complex, especially the Speaker and deputy Speaker’s lodges, said that the facilities require total rehabilitation. The speaker said, “We have finished touring the House of Assembly complex, the Speaker’s lodge and that of the deputy Speaker. The level of decay is highly unbelievable. “The complex was renovated last year but it is very unfortunate that it has broken down with cracks. It is clear that those who undertook the renovation work did a very poor job. “But beyond the dilapidated state of the complex, we have set up a committee to begin the recovery of stolen government’s properties belonging to the Imo state House of Assembly.” The speaker said the lawmakers were ready to ensure that every government’s property illegally taken by people was recovered.
