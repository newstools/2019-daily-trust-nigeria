INEC’s Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in Cross River state, Dr. Frankland Briyai may contest the governorship election in Bayelsa state billed for November 2019. Briyai, who is an indigene of Bayelsa state, said there has been much pressure on him from his people to indicate his interest. He disclosed this at his office in Calabar when the Commonwealth Students/Youth Federation for Peace paid him a courtesy call on Tuesday and presented him an award of honour. He said the pressure from his people may not be unconnected with the “meritorious services I have rendered to the people and the nation at large in various capacities.” Briyai thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for finding him worthy to serve as a REC. He also thanked all the INEC staff, the military, paramilitary and various groups that co-operated with him to make elections in Cross River “a huge success”. Chairman of the association, Kewulu Abiari Suleh said: “That is why we are here to honour the REC with an award as the Common Wealth Ambassador for Peace”. They listed the REC’s achievements and his qualities to include a successful and credible conduct of the 2019 governorship elections in Cross River, building an ICT office, a chapel at the INEC office, his credibility and philanthropic  gestures “which have marked him out as a unique Nigerian”. Similarly, the Nigerian coordinator of the group, Henry Nwankwo said “electoral malpractices are worse than military coup” adding that the transparent credible stance of the Cross River REC saved the country a lot of crisis in Cross River state.
