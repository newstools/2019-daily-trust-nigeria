The All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) has said it will challenge the declaration of Bello Mutawalle of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as winner of the March 9 governorship election in the state. APGA’s candidate in the election, Alhaji Sani Abdullahi Shinkafi, had withdrawn his petition challenging the declaration of Mukhtar Shehu Idris and his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as the winner of the gubernatorial election in the state. Counsel to Shinkafi and APGA, Barrister Ifeanyi Mbaeri, told reporters in Abuja after withdrawing the petition that the legal team was looking at the possibility of challenging INEC’s declaration of PDP and  Mutawalle as the governor of Zamfara State on the grounds that he was not qualified to have contested any elections because he did not obtain the basic requirements of the law. He said his clients, Shinkafi and APGA, may likely challenge the declaration of Mutawalle as governor of Zamfara State, with the possibility of filling a petition at the election tribunal to challenge INEC’s decision.
