A business manager has compared business and teambuilding in Nigeria and South Africa and concluded Nigerian business owners are hungry for success but unable to work as a team. Daniel Ikechukwu, country manager for the wellness and health chain Forever spoke upon return from the outfit’s global rally in Stockholm, Sweden. “Nigeria cannot be compared to South Africa, because presently, Nigeria has a population of over 200 million people, while South Africa has just 56 million. “However, when you weigh in on which country is hungrier for success. From that viewpoint, you find that South Africa with a background of apartheid, knows much more about collective struggle and how to fight as a team. That is slightly lacking in Nigerians, as our people struggle with working as a team.” Explaining further, he said: “Our people are yet to embrace the importance of team building in business; cooperation and collaboration. Here, we like to work for ourselves and many don’t care about uplifting others, even when those people actually look up to them.” Some 148 Nigerians were among about 15,000 business owners at the rally. They rocked attires in Nigeria’s national green-white-green for the global rally where Forever rewards business owners who have performed well and motivate others. “Everyone was amazing and regardless of the turbulent times in the economy, we represented our country well and gave a good account,” he said.
