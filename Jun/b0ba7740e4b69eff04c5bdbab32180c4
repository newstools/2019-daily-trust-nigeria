The Adamawa State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has responded to the move by Adamawa State House of Assembly to investigate some activities of the immediate-past administration. The Speaker of the Assembly, Aminu Iya Abbas (PDP), had on Tuesday announced three committees to probe financial standing, lingering salary crisis and recent recruitment of workers by the immediate-past APC government in the state. The APC state Organising Secretary, Ahmad Lawan, tasked the lawmakers to concentrate on check mating the present administration in the state rather than witch-hunting previous ones. The speaker, Iya Abbas said Hamman Tukur YettisuriÂ  (PDP) representing Jada/Mbulo would lead the investigation on salary, employment and transfer of service. Kate Raymond (PDP) representing Demsa Constituency is the chairman of the committee investigating the finances of the state while Simon Isa (PDP) representing Song heads the committee investigating Muslim and Christian pilgrims welfare boards. The report of the Transition Committee set up by Governor Umaru Fintiri before his inauguration had indicted his predecessor, Muhammad Jibrilla Bindow on allegations of financial impropriety and illegal last minute recruitment.
