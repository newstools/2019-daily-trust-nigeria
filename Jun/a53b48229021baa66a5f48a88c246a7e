The gunmen shot 12 dead in Gidan Wawa, 22 in Tungar Kahau, one in Kwallido. The armed men arrived on motorbikes, shooting people who were working on their farms. “Some of the farmers who sensed trouble when they saw them approach abandoned their working tools, took to their heels and hid behind shrubs. “About 17 months ago more than a dozen people were killed in an attack on Tungar Kahau village. This is the second time they are raiding the community. They warned the farmers to desist from going to farms or face dire consequences,” he added.
