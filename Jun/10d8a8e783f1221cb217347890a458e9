Zamfara state governor, Dr. Bello Muhammad Mutawalle, has approved the suspension of the Emir of Maru, Alhaji Abubakar Chika Ibrahim, and the district head of Kanoma, Alhaji Ahmad Lawal, with immediate effect. In a statement signed by the Director General, Government House Press Affairs, Alhaji Yusuf Idris, the duo were suspended after series of complaints about them on their alleged involvement in banditry and other criminal acts. He said the emir and district head would remain suspended until the outcome of the first investigation panel. The Emir is, however, directed to hand over official vehicles and all other government property in his possession to the most senior district head, while the suspended district head should hand over to the most senior village head.
