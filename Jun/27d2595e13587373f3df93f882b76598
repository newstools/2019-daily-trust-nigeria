A member of the 2015 APC Presidential Campaign Council, Alhaji Ibrahim Jirgi, yesterday, hailed the emergence of Governor Simon Bako Lalong of Plateau State as new chairman of the Northern Governors Forum. Jirgi, while commending the unanimity of the northern governors in the choice of Lalong, said it was wise, timely, well thought out and one of the most important decisions taken in recent times. He said the choice of Lalong from the North Central zone was a critical indicator that the North had overcome the artificial ethnic and religious misunderstanding that hampered its unity for too long. “Lalong’s choice is a clear signal that the northern intellectuals, professionals, elders and the political elite are resisting artificial divisions and are closing ranks for the general progress of the region. “Except those whose personal wealth and personal ambition remain tied to the continuation of decay and destruction of  the region, northern Christians and Muslims are appearing to be closing the religious divide, with the choice of Lalong as new NGF chairman,” Jirgi, managing director of  Tripple Cee Media, said. He emphasized that the choice is crucial at this point of the region’s search for unity, peace and communal harmony because Lalong was a right honourable gentleman with great qualities of integrity, adding that he is an excellent peace negotiator.
