Some hoodlum were said to have invaded the female hostels of Plateau State University, Bokkos, on Sunday night leading to the tragic death of a 100L male student of the institution. The Vice Chancellor of the university, Professor Yohana Daniel Izam, on Monday confirmed the incident saying it left a 100 level student of Geography department of the school dead after he sustained gunshot injuries. A source from the university told our correspondent that the student was one of those who stormed the female hostel in an attempt to try to rescue the female students but was gunned down. However, a statement issued by the institution’s Public Relations Officer, John Agam, stated that the Vice Chancellor regrets the demise of “the promising young man particularly after a successful matriculation held at the university last week Friday.” The statement extended its sympathy to the family of the deceased and the entire university community over what it described as a shocking development. The Vice Chancellor also appealed for calm and cooperation saying the campus security committee in collaboration with the Operation Safe Haven have since swung into action to review the situation with a view of identifying the perpetrators of the crime.
