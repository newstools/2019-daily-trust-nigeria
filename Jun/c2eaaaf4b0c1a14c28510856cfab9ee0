The Niger State Independent Electoral Commission (NSIEC) has fixed July 31 for local government election in the state. The commission said it was abiding by the law which stipulated that it gave one month notice to enable political parties and candidates prepare for the poll. The commission fixed the cost of nomination form for the chairmanship position at N100,000, while that of councillorship was pegged at N80,000. However, Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC) rejected the NSIEC proposition on the fees, arguing that the fees would gag small parties and prevent them from contesting, while giving major parties an edge, IPACâ€™s state secretary, Mohammed Bello Maikujeri observed.
