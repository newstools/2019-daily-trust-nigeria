The tension that ravaged the campus of Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) Ile-Ife, Osun State, for a couple of weeks, over threat of a bloody attack by cultists, has subsided with the arrest of leaders of Vikings Confraternity (VC) of Oduduwa University, Ipetumodu. A gang of cultists, under a pseudonymous “Cultists of Aloha clan” had threatened to invade OAU campus today (Saturday, June 1) “to rain bullets of death, sorrow and grief on innocent students”. This threat caused panic on OAU campus and many students fled while those remained on the campus were apprehensive of their safely. OAU management reacted to the threat in a statement, signed by the Public Relations Officer of the University, Mr Abiodun Olanrewaju, in which he assured that security agencies were on top of the situation. The issue had been trending online with the hashtag “#WinterInOAU”, putting parents and guardians of the students in fears. A top security operative told Daily Trust that: “There is a strong heat between OAU students and the cultists of Oduduwa university and a threat letter was issued by the cultists, promising to invade OAU premises on 1/6/2019.” However, the tension seemed to have subsided with the arrest of the leader to the dreadful cult gang on Friday by the Anti-Cultism Squad of the Osun State Police Command. A senior police officer told our correspondent that “security networking was utilised by men employed by the Commissioner of Police, Abiodun Ige and they have arrested four leaders of Vikings Confraternity”.
