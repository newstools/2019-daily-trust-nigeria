The FCT chapter of Association of Master Bakers and Caterers of Nigeria (AMBCN) has urged the National Agency for Food, Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) to review the high tariffs imposed on bakers in the territory. Spokesman of the association, Malam Nura Musa, who made the call while addressing newsmen, yesterday in Abuja, said NAFDAC has increased tariff on registration of products by 90 percent, which he said could adversely affect their business. He said the registration fee for bakery which was N31, 750 is now N89,750 while registration form, which was N250 is now N2,500. “Also, the renewal of registration licence from N15,000 has now been increased to N156,250, “ he claimed. He stated that production without a chief baker that was formally N50,000 has been increased to N200,000, saying tampering with old label which he said was N537,500 is now N3. 375 million. He said other tariffs imposed included pack of size extension which was N10, 500  but is now N84,000, adding that there was also change in production name which is now N84,000 from N21,000. “So it is on this premise that we are appealing to the Federal Government and NAFDAC to assist the bakers to remain in business because a lot of bakeries are folding up and this will further affect our business,” he said.
