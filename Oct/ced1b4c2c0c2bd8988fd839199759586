The Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) says it will soon commence the installation of another VSAT station and VHF radio systems at Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu. Managing Director of NAMA Capt. Fola Akinkuotu, who revealed this at the 48th Annual General Meeting of the Nigerian Air Traffic Controllers’ Association (NATCA) held in Kano, said the installation of the equipment would enhance upper airways communication along the South East corridor using 127.3MHz radio frequency. This followed the successful installation of the VSAT (very small aperture terminal) station at the Jos airport and the integration of the VHF (very high frequency) into the network in the North East corridor. Akinkuotu said the agency’s determination to totally eliminate blind spots from the upper airspace informed the recent deployments. In the bulletin issued by NAMA, the MD was quoted as saying the agency had gone far in improving communication between pilots and ATCs.
