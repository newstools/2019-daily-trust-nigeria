The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has assured persons with disabilities (PWDs) that adequate provisions have been made to guarantee their full participation in the November 16th governorship election in Kogi. Resident Electoral Commissioner in Kogi Prof James Apam, who gave the assurance in Lokoja at a sensitisation forum the commission organised for the PWDs in collaboration with the International Foundation for Electoral System (IFES), said the commission was committed to an all-inclusive participation in the electoral process. He said priority would be given to the PWDs by allowing them to vote first on election day.

Meanwhile, INEC has charged journalists on investigative reportage to complement the commission’s efforts in achieving free and fair poll.
