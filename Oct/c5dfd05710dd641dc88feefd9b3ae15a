The Senate Chief Whip, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu was also in attendance at the meeting. The mission was to invite the Senate President to the 10th National Prayer Breakfast scheduled to hold on 31st October, 2019 at the International Conference Center, Abuja. The Senate President said the Prayer Breakfast was timely and urged all to first seek the face of God for answered prayers ahead of the programme. “Today, we face serious security challenges. Where we have security agencies which are mandated to ensure that we are secured and protected, if nothing, we should pray for them that they are able to perform well. “It is not only in empowering them with weapons; the power of God is beyond weapons. I’m sure that all people of faith will continue to pray for our security agencies to protect us,” Lawan said. The Senate President, who also mentioned challenges in the economy, said as leaders, “we have the responsibility to ensure that we continue to provide leadership, to continue to seek the intervention of God in the way and manner that we lead our people.” Senate Presidency: Northern group rejects Lawan, backs Ndume APC, PDP senators clash over FG’s social intervention fund Rowdy session in Senate over ‘militarization of elections’
