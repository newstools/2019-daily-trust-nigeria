The Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, has said that payment of the new minimum wage would take effect immediately, adding that it cuts across both the public and private sectors. He disclosed this early yesterday in Abuja shortly after a government team concluded a meeting with labour leaders. The disagreement had centred around the consequential adjustments in salaries that must be implemented across the board in line with the new minimum wage law.
