The National Vice President of the Police Community Relations Committee (PCRC) in the South-west, Alhaji Mogaji Ibrahim Olaniyan, says “solid relationship “ among the Commissioners of Police and the PCRC members across the region has produced improved security. Olaniyan noted that the CPs had been taming kidnapping and other crimes due to the cooperation and support of the PCRC members, hunters and fishermen. The PCRC leader spoke in Abeokuta, Ogun State, with journalists at the weekend on the sidelines of a sensitization seminar organised for newly elected divisional executives of the PCRC in the Abeokuta Area Command. The zonal leader, who pledged the PCRC’s commitment to playing its role in the fight against crime in the South-west, noted that the fight against insecurity cannot be left in the hands of security agents alone. “Across the South-west, we are lucky to have all our Commissioners of Police with us. They are cooperating with us and this is yielding good results. “Sometimes ago, we were all aware of kidnapping in Osun and Ekiti states. The scourge also wanted to rear its ugly head in Ogun State, but with the cooperation of the PCRC members, hunters, community leaders and the police, that is now a thing of the past. From Ondo, Osun, Ekiti and Ogun, all our Commissioners of Police are working hand-in-hand with the PCRC to ensure we tame the menace of insecurity in the region. And already, we are getting good results,” Olaniyan said. The Area Commander of the Abeokuta Metro Area Command, Assistant Commissioner Musiliu Aliu,  commended the role being played by the PCRC members in securing the state, even as he urged them not to rest on their oars.
