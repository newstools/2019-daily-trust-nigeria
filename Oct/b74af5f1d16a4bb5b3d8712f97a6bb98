The Nigeria Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NNRA) has launched a Radiation Portal Monitor (RPM) for the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) to use at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. Speaking at the launch at the cargo terminal on Tuesday, the acting Director General of NNRA, Dr. Yau Idris, said, with the monitor, it would now be impossible for any radiation sources to pass through the country’s airport. He said, “We are starting with the Abuja International Airport and we are going to replicate it at all the international airports, seaports and land borders. OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY By the time we are done, any radioactive material that is coming or going out of the country will be detected.” Dr. Idris said Nigeria, which is the highest importer of radioactive materials in Africa, had also recorded a lot of illicit trafficking of radiation sources, and added that the installation of the RPM was among strategies to curtail illicit trafficking of radiation sources. He said the European Union (EU) in 2009 donated a similar monitor to Nigeria but that the one being donated to FAAN was bought by NNRA through its capital appropriation.
