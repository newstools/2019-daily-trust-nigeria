The Nigerian Senate has questioned the allocation of N600 million to the already privatised Distribution Companies (DisCos) by Ministry of Power in the 2020 budget. The Chairman, Senate Committee on Power, Senator Gabriel Suswan, raised the concerns on Tuesday during the 2020 budget defence by the ministry. He said that government should rather inject money into Mambila Hydro Power Project to ensure stability in power supply in the country.

Responding, the Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Power, Louis Edozien, justified the inclusion of N600 million in the 2020 budget for Discos. Edozien said the said N600 million was to be dispensed in line with the agreement the Power ministry had with the Discos.
