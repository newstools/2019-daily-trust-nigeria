The ministerial taskforce team on free flow of traffic has seized 79 rams from roadside traders at the popular Dutsen Alhaji Market, along Bwari road. The chairman of the ministerial taskforce team, Mr. Ikharo Attah, while addressing newsmen at the market on Saturday, said the decision to evacuate the rams from the roadside was taken after the traders did not heed to advice to relocate. He said the team was shocked to discover that an illegal mini abattoir was established within ck premises where rams were slaughtered and roasted for consumers.

He warned that roadside trading would not be allowed, saying it would not only affect free flow of traffic but also paint Abuja in bad light. He also warned managers of markets not to allocate car parks to traders for the purpose of selling, saying doing so was also responsible for  buyers parking along the road and causing gridlocks. The  evacuation operation was led by Mr. Kaka Bello of the Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB).
