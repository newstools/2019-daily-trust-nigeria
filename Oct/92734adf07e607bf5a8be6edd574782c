The Federal High Commissioner, National Refugees, Migrants and IDPs, Senator Basheer G. Muhammad, has assured Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Abuja that President Muhammadu Buhari is working on ways to relocate them to a more comfortable place. He made this promise in Abuja on Saturday when he visited Durumi IDPs camp to celebrate his 53rd birthday with them. “My family and friends thought we should come here to be with our people and I thank the almighty Allah for His blessings,” he said.

According to him, the planned relocation was as a result of growing concerns and calls from persons living in various IDP camps across the country to be properly resettled in places where they can lead normal, responsible lives. “Government is trying very hard and soon, they will be out of here,” he assured. In his remarks earlier, the Durumi IDPs camp Public Relations Officer (PRO), Umar Gola, commended the commission for its concern and assistance. He urged the FCT Minister, Mallam Muhammed Bello, to reconsider the ban on motorcycle operations in the city centre as most of the operators were displaced people working to earn a living as IDPs “We are pleading with the minister of the FCT to have a re-think about this policy and help especially our young men who are in this business to get livelihood for their families. “We have over 600 young men who are doing motorcycle business in the town. But with the ban, I think we are creating more problems for our people because we will not have work for them,” he said.  page 45 We are in danger, female IDPs raise alarm in Abuja camps How IDP camps in Abuja celebrated Sallah in style
