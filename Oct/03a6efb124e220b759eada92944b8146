Eight persons have been arrested by the police for allegedly selling the meat of the eight cows killed by lightening at Ekan-Ile area of Ikare, Akoko Northeast local government area of Ondo state. It was gathered that the cows were killed on Tuesday, but instead of disposing them, herdsmen who owned the dead cows roasted them and started selling the meat to unsuspecting butchers in Akoko area.
