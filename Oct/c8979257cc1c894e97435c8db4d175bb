The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has called for the immediate prosecution of four officials of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) who allegedly beat a man to death for resisting their attempt to collect bribe from him. Mr. Odion Omafo Samuel was allegedly killed by the four FRSC officials, Francis Igboh, Sunday Ogi, Samson Alolade and Joseph Onolade on 14 October, 2019 after flagging down his Audi 80 car at Okhuaihe Hill along Benin-Agbor Road. His body was reportedly buried in a shallow grave by the suspects. Reacting to the development, the MURIC Director, Prof. Ishaq Akintola, described the killing as callous, wicked and detestable. According to him, with the killing of Samuel Omafo Odion, FRSC men have disappointed Nigerians, lamenting that the same people posted on the nation’s roads to ensure citizen’s safety have become their killers. “Men of road safety have become road killers. It is preposterous. This is additional evidence that there are criminals among officials of the FRSC. We demand immediate prosecution of the suspects. There must be no coverup from anywhere. We call on FRSC authorities to stop their men from flagging down motorists on lonely highways. Such method is an avenue for extortion, intimidation and other criminal activities like this recent killing. “FRSC officials often expose motorists to danger by stopping them in odd places. Vehicles stopped on lonely stretches may refuse to start when the driver is eventually allowed to go. This is very dangerous particularly with the security challenges facing Nigeria. FRSC leadership is therefore urged to inject a human face to the modus operandi of its men. Besides, there is need for FRSC leadership to review its recruitment methods with a view to weeding out criminal elements from inception,” Akintola said.
