The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has told Nigeria to step up effort to deepen its non-oil revenues. IMF particularly asked Nigeria to raise its tax revenues as Nigeria’s tax revenue is one of the worst in the world. The Assistant Director of Fiscal Affairs of IMF, Ms. Cathy Pattilo, stated this during the Global Fiscal Monitor Report released on Wednesday in Washington DC. OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY Ms. Pattilo said, “The priority is a comprehensive reform to increase non-oil tax and there are a number of reasons this will contribute to creating space for important spending in infrastructure and human development spending. “For Nigeria, this is very important for a number of reasons. One, because right now interest payments as share of tax are every very high around a third of overall and two-thirds for the Federal Government. This because interest payments are particularly high because the denominator is incredibly low. “Nigeria has one of the lowest tax ratios in the world, and it’s not because Nigeria doesn’t have big development problem, but because the challenge is that Nigeria has a lot of needs for education and health spending. It has some very low indicators in that area, and in demographic projections, Nigeria has been projected to be by 2050 the third most populous country in the world. So addressing those challenges is really important.” IMF to Nigeria: Cut down on tax exemptions, incentives IMF cautions Nigeria against forex depletion, says capital flight will last a while Growth: IMF urges Nigeria to prioritise infrastructure projects
