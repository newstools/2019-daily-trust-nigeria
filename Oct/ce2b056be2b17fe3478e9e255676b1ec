The president promised that the effort would be sustained to check illegal activities of this nature. He appealed to members of the public to remain vigilant and assist security agencies in crime prevention and control by reporting criminal activities in their communities. “Sharing intelligence is everybody’s responsibility. This government is ever committed to supporting the police to be more effective in the performance of its duties through proper funding and motivation of its personnel,’’ the statement added.
