The Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, yesterday raised the alarm that scammers were using his office to defraud Nigerians. He decried unrelenting activities of faceless persons using the social media and other platforms to lure unsuspecting Nigerians to submit their Curriculum Vitae at a fee, to a non-existing desk in his office for federal government appointments. The SGF, in a statement by the Director of Information in his office, Willie Bassey, said he was also aware of inaccurate information being peddled around regarding constituency projects being executed under its supervision.
