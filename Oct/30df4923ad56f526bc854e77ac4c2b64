The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has said it will partner the six area councils and other agencies of government to address challenges of water supply, sanitation, and hygiene in rural areas. The Minister of State for FCT, Hajiya Ramatu Aliyu, stated this during an inspection tour of facilities in Gwagwalada Area Council on Tuesday. She said the provision of potable water, adequate sanitation, and hygiene were primarily the responsibilities of states and local governments.

The minister, however, commended the FCT Universal Basic Education Board (UBEB) for the construction of two blocks of VIP toilet at Tungan Maje Secondary School. She described as worrisome the assessment by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in collaboration with UNICEF, that 50 percent of Abuja residents defecate in open spaces. The minister used the occasion to declare that the present rating was unacceptable, assuring that the FCT administration was determined to change the narrative.
