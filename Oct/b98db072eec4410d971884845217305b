The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the House of Representatives has expressed fear over alleged plans to subvert the case of their presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, at the Supreme Court. The caucus, in a statement yesterday, jointly signed by its leader, Kingsley Chinda, Deputy leader, Chukuma Onyema, Whip, Umar Barde and Deputy Whip, Muraina Ajibola, alleged that, there was an attempt to influence the selection of the most senior justices to hear the case. “Chief Justices of Nigeria through time have never in the selection of the Supreme Court surrendered to the phoney dictates of the ruling parties. OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY “We are proud to state here that, never in our great party’s time in power did it or its personages, dictate selection of panel members to Chief Justices. Never! “What isn’t conventional is the present attempt to influence Chief Justice Ibrahim Tanko, going by reports in the media, to subvert the age-long and time-tested practice, precedent and convention of selecting the most senior Justices of the Supreme Court to hear the presidential election panel,” the caucus alleged.
