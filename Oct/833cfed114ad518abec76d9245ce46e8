A member of the House of Representatives,  representing Argungu and Augie Federal Constituency,  Isa Bashar Matawalle, has asked Kebbi State Independent Electoral Commission (KESIEC) to cancel the last Saturday’s local government election in  Galadima and Dikko wards in Argungu local government area. The lawmaker, during a press briefing in Birnin Kebbi, alleged that the returning officer announced results of the election in the two wards while voters were still casting their votes at the two wards. “I went to cast my vote in the morning, what I saw was shocking.  As I was about to enter the village, I heard that the returning officer of Argungu local government has announced the results of all the wards while people were still casting their votes”. He called on KESIEC to address the issue by ensuring that the votes of the electorate at the wards were protected and the right candidates declared winners of the election. He said his party, the APC, and KESIEC were not responsible for what happened at the wards but blamed some politicians, whom he said plotted to rig the election in the wards. He called on KESIEC to cancel the election in both wards and conduct another election.
