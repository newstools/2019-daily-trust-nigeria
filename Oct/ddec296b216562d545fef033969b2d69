He expressed concern that cyber criminals were increasingly targeting mobile devices because they contained valuable data, such as banking passwords and usernames, e-commerce and social media logins, and personal information that can be used to identity theft scams. “Cyber security is all about protecting your data and vital information from unauthorised electronic access which is normally done through gaining unauthorised access of mobile devices such as phones, computers,” he said.
