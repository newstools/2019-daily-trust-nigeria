An expert in food crop production, Akhibi Onoke, has hailed the closure of Nigeria’s land borders against illegal smuggling of food items and goods that are locally produced in the country. He said the Buhari’s administration has displayed political will in blocking leakages in accruable revenue the nation lost on daily basis to smuggling activities at the borders. Onoke said pressures have been on local producers as smugglers bring in what can be produced in the country through the porous borders. Speaking specifically about rice as a staple food item in Nigerian households, the expert said the new policy would motivate the rice farmers to produce more. However, he said the stoppage of illegal smuggling of edible rice through land borders by the Nigerian Customs Service has no doubt caused a series of frantic activities in the subsector in the past few weeks. Onoke expressed satisfaction that for the first time Nigerian farmers and processors have the opportunity to service the over 7 million  metric ton annual market demand in Nigeria. ‘Border closure will boost local rice production’ Importation, exportation ban grounds commercial activities Why price of local rice is high - Millers
