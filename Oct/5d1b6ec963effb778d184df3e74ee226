Confusion yesterday trailed the purported indictment of former Lagos Governor Akinwunmi Ambode by his ex-commissioners who appeared before an ad hoc committee of the House of Assembly investigating the purchase of 820 buses and other projects undertaken by the last administration. The former commissioners, Olusegun Banjo and Olawale Oluwo who served as Commissioner for Economic Planning and Budget; and Energy and Mineral Resources respectively said yesterday they never indicted the governor. They made the clarification even as the committee chaired by Fatai Mojeed (Ibeju-Lekki 1) is set to submit its interim report to the House after the former governor failed to honour summons to appear before it.

The committee had summoned the governor and some of his commissioners but Ambode did not honour the invitation while two of the former commissioners attended the meeting on Monday. But the commissioners yesterday decried what they called “sensational reportage” of their appearance before the committee, saying they never indicted the former governor as reported.
