An Ado-Ekiti chief magistrate court in Ekiti State has remanded in prison custody a 59-year-old man, Dauda Jimoh, over alleged defilement of a nine-year-old. The police prosecutor, Inspector Monica Ikebuilo, briefed the court yesterday that Jimoh committed the offence on September 27, 2019 in Ilupeju-Ekiti. Ikebuilo said the accused person, who she described as the landlord to the girl’s mother, had been defiling the girl whenever her mother was not at home.

Ikebuilo said the small girl told the police that the accused person had defiled her five times, while Jimoh argued it was only twice that he did. The prosecutor urged the court to remand the defendant in prison pending legal advice from the office of the Ondo State Director of Public Prosecution. No plea was taken for Jimoh. The chief magistrate, Mrs Adefumike Anoma, ordered that Jimoh be remanded in prison and adjourned the case until November 11, 2019 for mention.
