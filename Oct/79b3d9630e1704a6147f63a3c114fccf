The Chairman of Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), Abdullahi Candido, has advised Nigerians to buy shares to fight poverty and invest for their future. Candido gave the advice at the first general meeting of shareholders of AMAC Microfinance Bank. The chairman said buying and selling shares was an avenue for people to secure their future and that of their children. He said, “I want to urge you all to take opportunity of buying and selling shares to invest and secure your future. “There is nothing too big or small as far as investment is concerned, as we all know that the Dangotes and Otedolas started like this. “I also want to encourage us not to eat all our earnings today and forget tomorrow as it will not be good if your tomorrow meets you with nothing.” The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the bank, Mr. Emmanuel Ohakim, said the meeting was meant to deliberate and approve strategic objectives on how to increase its paid-up capital. Earlier, the Managing Director (MD) of the bank, Mr. Micheal Nzegwu, said as part of its mission to economically empower Micro, Small and Medium Entreprises (MSMEs), the rights issue of the bank would be open to existing shareholders and the public. Mr. Nzegwu added that the public would partake in buying shares from December. 31, 2019.
