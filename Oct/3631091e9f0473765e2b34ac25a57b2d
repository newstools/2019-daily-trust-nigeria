The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to accept his alleged failure in governance and seek help in the interest of the nation. The party claimed that the Presidency was as a result of the alleged failure conjuring false statistics “to cover its incompetence.” PDP in a statement yesterday, by its National Publicity Secretary Kola Ologbondiyan, also claimed that Buhari had resorted to self-applause.
