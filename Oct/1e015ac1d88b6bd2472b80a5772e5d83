He stated that the IGR was projected at N30 billion, at N2.5bn monthly for 2020. He also said that over 3000 companies are registered in Anambra and many  are operating effectively, noting  that state would make efforts to ensure they pay taxes. He also said the government has instituted in-built mechanisms to checkmate leakages in IGR generation. He urged residents and indigenes of Anambra to pay their taxes, dues and levies to enable the government to meet up with the 2020 budget and provide basic human amenities. The state Commissioner for Works, Mr Ifejiofor said government has budgeted N6bn for the Anambra cargo airport because the governor promised to complete it before he leaves office. Principal Secretary to the Governor, Willie Nwokoye, said the budget was a deficit with key assumptions that can erase the need to borrow.
