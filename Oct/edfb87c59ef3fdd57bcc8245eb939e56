The Abuja Concerned Facility Managers (ACFM) has called on the FCT Administration to address  what it called the gross under-utilization of the Sharia Court building in Gwagwalada. Coordinator of the group, Malam Abdulrasheed Abubakar, stated this in a statement after taking inventories of government property in Gwagwalada Area Council. He said the group has come to the conclusion that the property housing the Sharia court should be put to effective use to avoid wastage of government resources. OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY Abubakar said ACFM members who were on the recent tour of Gwagwalada Area Council with the FCT Minister of State came back with the report of underutilization and therefore  advised on the  relocation of the FCT Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board to the premises of Sharia Court. “It is disturbing that the FCT Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board saddled with the responsibility of pilgrims welfare, training, and issuance of passport is sharing apartment with other agencies of government. It is our candid view that the building housing the Sharia Court should be allocated to FCT Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board for effective use,” he said.  2018 Hajj: FCT commences biometric exercise 2018 Hajj: FCT Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board begins collection of deposit Hajj: FCT pilgrims board begins compulsory medical screening
