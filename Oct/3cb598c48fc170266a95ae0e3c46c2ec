A 38-year-old man, Abiodun Ajayi, has been arraigned before an Ikeja, Lagos, magistrate court for alleged impersonation and falsely representing himself as a police sergeant to one Ariyo Arinola attached to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, Ikeja. The police told the court that Ajayi committed the offences in July 2019 at about 8am at the Ikorodu area of Lagos. The police prosecutor, Sergeant Unah Mike, told the court that Ajayi impersonated a police officer with intent to extort monetary gain from a person he accused of committing an offence, and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 303(a)(b) of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State of Nigeria, 2015.
