Katsina State House of Assembly yesterday concluded the screening of commissioner-nominees but deferred confirmation till next week Monday. Governor Aminu Masari had forwarded the names of 17 persons for screening and confirmation as members of the state executive council. After the conclusion of the screening exercise yesterday, most of the members kicked against immediate confirmation when the assembly returned to plenary and asked that it be rescheduled to another day. The speaker, Tasiâ€™u Zango, then asked that the matter be moved to Monday for their confirmation. Sources close to the assembly told our reporter that the action was an unusual situation which signalled friction that needed to be addressed between the executive and legislature as well as the nominees and their representatives at the assembly.
