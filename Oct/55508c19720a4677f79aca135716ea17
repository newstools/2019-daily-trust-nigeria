Some of them were also sealed for offences ranging from pump underdispensing and poor house-keeping. “We will also continue to monitor gas plants because we know that people are now using cooking gas more than before because kerosene is no longer much available. “So, as more people are using cooking gas, we should also be aware of the safety implications to the plant owners and the people that have bought the gas for their own consumption. “The exercise will continue because we want to ensure that whatever you are buying at forecourt is what actually you have paid for. We don’t want members of the public to be shortchanged. This is why we are trying to ensure we keep the tempo of our activities going.” DPR seals 53 filling stations, 4 gas stations in Kaduna DPR seals 21 petrol stations, 4 illegal LPG refilling points in A’ Ibom DPR seals 40 filling stations in Nasarawa
