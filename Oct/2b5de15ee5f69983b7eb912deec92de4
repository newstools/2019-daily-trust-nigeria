IBBA 36 Global Concept, a private enterprise in Maiduguri, has trained over 500 IDPs displaced by the Boko Haram insurgency on entrepreneurship. These comprised 300 widows and orphans, who were trained in small business management, and 200 youths trained on various other aspects of entrepreneurship. The managing director of the company, Ibrahim Balami, told Daily Trust after the maiden DBN MSMEs summit that a recent survey on the successes of the business of 100 IDPs trained on poultry farming showed 98 percent success. “This shows that once you build people’s capacity it makes it easier for them to succeed in their various businesses,” he said, observing further that, “the finance will come later, because if you don’t know the business first, then you get money, the first thing that comes to your mind is the problem in your house and the money will go there. “Before you know it, you lose all the money, and if you are asked to account for it, you will not be able to. “But when you train someone on how to do business even before he gets the money, the next thing he does when he gets money is how to utilize it to generate more money out of which he commits some to solving the problems of the house,” Balami said. He said with proper training on business skills and entrepreneurship, the disbursement of the required finances, as well as effective monitoring, the North East would be able to resuscitate its industries grounded by the insurgency. “The challenge we have in the region is that of people not being knowledgeable on running businesses,” Balami lamented.
