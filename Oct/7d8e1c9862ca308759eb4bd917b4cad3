An organisation working to  alleviate youth unemployment in the country, Street Project Foundation, has called for employer partners to participate in its third edition of its creative youth boot camp. The Foundation said that the camp, which begins on November 11, 2019 with the theme, ‘Art for Social Transformation’ presents an opportunity for singers, musicians, poets, creative writers, presenters, comedians, spoken word artistes, actors, visual artists, fashion enthusiasts and performance artistes of any kind to hone their skills under the guidance and mentorship of industry experts. At the end of the six-week camp, participants will be placed on internships with employer partners and matched with mentors. OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY The Project’s founder and Lead Visionary, Rita Ezenwa-Okoro, told journalists that the initiative employs performance to build soft skills in youths, as well as ensures that youths in Nigeria pursue their passion while giving them a platform to showcase their talents. “The whole essence of this is to teach young people soft skills that they need for the workplace. One thing that people are always looking out for when they want to hire the entry-level position is the character of work: timeliness, ability to communicate effectively, project management, teamwork and team-building. These are all we teach our young people when they come to the creative youth boot camp. We want to encourage employers to partner with us because a big part of the project is internship placement and mentoring after the boot camp,” she said.
