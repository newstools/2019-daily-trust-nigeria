A former governor of Kano State, Senator Ibrahim Shekarau (APC, Kano) has said that all political parties in the country have similar manifestoes and constitutions. He made the assertion during the 59th Nigerian Independence lectures organised by Hudaibiyya Centre held at Aminu Kano College of Legal and Islamic Studies, Kano. “Speaking from experience, when we wanted to form the All Progressives Congress (APC), I was among the three people that represented 89 people in the processes. We worked for six months trying to form the constitution and manifesto of APC and in the process we collected the constitutions and manifestos of over 30 registered political parties in the country. OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY “To our surprise, all the parties have similar manifestos and constitutions but with different use of English, therefore whichever political party one belongs to is as good as the others and vice versa. “If you are in doubt, get a copy of all the party constitutions and manifestos and you will understand what I am saying,” he said. Earlier in his presentation, Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed said Nigeria as a nation was in need of trustworthy leadership better than anything. He added that, “the bitter truth is that the North has not benefitted from President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration.” All Nigerian political parties are necessary evils – Senator Shekarau Kwankwaso runs a cult – Shekarau The problem with having Kwankwaso in APC  – Rep Kawu
