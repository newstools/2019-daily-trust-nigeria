He explained that the statement by the governor was purely normal and political statement and frowned at how it was being misinterpreted to the extent of linking the issue with faith. He noted that the statement was misinterpreted and did not carry his actual message, adding that the governor only praised the former president whom he described as his political mentor and role model for giving him the mandate to serve as FCT Minister during his administration. The commissioner appealed to the trouble makers to desist from using the statement to achieve their political gains as the governor will always have respect for his religion.
