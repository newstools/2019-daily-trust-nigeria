Bayelsa State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has said that its candidate for the November 16 governorship election in the state, Chief David Lyon, is not a cultist and criminal as alleged by Governor Henry Seriake Dickson. Dickson made the allegation yesterday at the inauguration of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) campaign team. The state publicity secretary of APC and secretary media committee of David Lyon campaign council, Mr Doifie Buokoribo, described the governor’s claim as habitual deception and mudslinging.
