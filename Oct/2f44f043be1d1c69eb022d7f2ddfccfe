The Chairman of the FCT Secondary Education Board (SEB) Alhaji Musa Yahaya Muhammad has urged Parents Teachers Association (PTA) of secondary schools in the territory to execute projects in their respective schools. Muhammad made the call when he received executives of the Parents Teachers Association (PTA) of the Government Secondary School (GSS) Shere, Bwari Area Council in his office yesterday. He said during his recent visit to GSS Shere he discovered an outstanding project executed by the PTA of the school, saying there was need for other PTAs to emulate that of the GSS Shere. “On behalf of the entire members and management of the FCT education board, we wish to thank the PTA of GSS Shere, for constructing two blocks of boys hostels, which I am calling on PTAs of other schools to emulate by embarking on projects in their respective schools,” he said. The board chairman, however, said such projects wouldn’t have been successful without the support of the school principal. Speaking on behalf of the PTA executives, the principal of the school, Musa Gupa, who led the delegation, commended the board chairman for the support given to the school, saying the school has a good working relationship with the PTA executives of the school.
