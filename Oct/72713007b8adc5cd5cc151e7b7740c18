There is a need for all stakeholders to support Nigerian teenagers and youths to contribute positively to the Nigerian project, it has been observed. Besides, parents were implored to understand the psyche of the current set of teenagers usually referred to as “the Millennials”, and dialogue with them, in view of the fact that, they are going through what psychologists call “Exploratory stage”. These were some of the observations at the summit with the theme: “Discovering and harnessing the potentials of 21st century Muslim Teens” organized by the NasruLlah-il Fathi Society (NASFAT).

The Education Secretary of Nasfat, Dr Rahmat Adisa said, her committee in collaboration with its Children affairs counterpart realised that, this budding and energetic segment needs to always  be heard and guided appropriately.
