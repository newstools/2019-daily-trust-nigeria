The Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, has called on staff of the FCT Administration to play their roles as individuals and as a team for the overall success of the administration. Malam Bello stated this yesterday while declaring open the maiden edition of the FCT Chapter of Joint Union Action Committee (JUAC) Week. He emphasized that when staff do not do their jobs there is bound to be system failure.

And if this does not happen and certain things are not done well, the ship will sink. And when a ship sinks, everybody sinks.  Even if there are survivors,  they are going to survive in a very weak state,” he said. While soliciting  the continuous support of staff, he assured that he would do his best to ensure a better and more productive workforce for the FCTA. In his welcome remarks, the Chairman of FCT JUAC,  Oluwakorede Matilukore, promised the cooperation and support of staff for the success of his second stint in office as FCT Minister as he lauded him for the “achievements recorded between 2015 and the first half of 2019.”  FCTA, INEC partner on voter registration FCT, NCC collaborate on sundry telecom matters FCTA promotes 3000 staff
