The chairperson, Environmental Preservation Development and Restoration International Organisation (EPDRIO), Prince Sam Gbadebo, has said the intervention of the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) authorities saved a lingering problem in the environment sector from degenerating into crises. He said the move of the council would save their businesses and also ensure a sustained revenue source for the council. He said the AMAC chairman, Abdullahi Adamu Candido intervention and resolution to clear the air on the claim of Holmes Multi-Media Synergy Limited as the council’s authorized pest control, fumigation and landscaping vendor was timely, adding that delay could have made residents and stakeholders to rise against the vendor. He commended Candido for making it known that Holmes Multi-Media Synergy Limited was not a vendor but a consultant. Prince Gbadebo said the council made its position known after series of meetings in August and October. Among other resolutions was that “Holmes Multi-Media Synergy Limited should suspend its activities, withdraw his demand notices and apologize to the public and association,” he said. Gbadebo had earlier written to the council demanding that all demand notices by the acclaimed authorized AMAC vendor should be looked into in the interest of all the stakeholders. Gbadebo said the resolution on the council was heart-warming and commended Candido for considering the interest of its over 500 members. “We implore the council to create an enabling environment for businesses to flourish and support SMEs as being championed by President Muhammadu Buhari,” he said.
