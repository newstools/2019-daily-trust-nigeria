The All Progressives Congress (APC) youths in Remoland, Ogun State, yesterday asked those they tagged “desperate cabals” to stop acts of maltreatment and humiliation against Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. The youths, under the aegis of Remo APC Youths, alleged that the cabals are hell-bent on stripping Osinbajo of “his garment of honour.” Speaking during a solidarity demonstration in Abeokuta, the group expressed concern that there was campaign of calumny against Osinbajo over the 2023 presidency.

He, however, warned the “evil perpetrators” to desist from actions that could trigger unrest in the country. “There are coordinated attacks at bringing down our man, the pride of Ogun State, from the seat he occupies. We unequivocally state that the vice president is an upright man with unblemished integrity, and he would not have indulged in corruption that can bring his hard earned name into disrepute. “It is quite appalling that the desperate cabals are behind this mischievous act of calumny to strip the vice president of his garment of honour. We are happy the guerrilla campaign holds no water in the face of right thinking Nigerians, who have stood in solidarity with him,” he said.
