The Network of African Science Academies (NASAC) has urged Nigerian women scientists to produce cutting-edge scientific research that will solve social and economic problems in the country. NASAC’s Executive Director Jackie Olang made the appeal in Abuja at the just concluded Women in Science Summit themed: Women in Science organised in Abuja by the Nigerian Academy of Science (NAS). Olang who was the keynote speaker said women scientists should become the “voice of science” in the global arena and book a place for themselves when critical issues about science are discussed.
