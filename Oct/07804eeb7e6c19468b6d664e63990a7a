The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) says it has launched a global advocacy campaign to encourage and promote patronage of made-in-Nigeria products through circulating members’ product’s lists booklets to all Nigerian embassies and Federal Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) nationwide. This was revealed by the National President of MAN, Alhaji Mansur Ahmed, while addressing the 46th Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Kano/Jigawa branch of the association, held in Kano. He said the advocacy campaign was recently initiated by the new leadership of the association with the aim of providing visibility for all the products manufactured in the country, as well as to ease their procurement by all customers as a step towards reaching out to indigenous manufacturers and encouraging wide patronage of the products.

Ahmed also noted that the profile of MAN has been on the rise, as well as a rise in her responsibility in the West African sub-region, and the Continent of Africa, such as the responsibility for reviving the Federation of West Africa Manufacturers Association (FEWAMA) assigned by the ECOWAS Commission and Africa Union. On the recently signed African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement (AfCFTA), the MAN president disclosed that the association has the backing of government to enhance the capacity of the manufacturing sector to maximize the opportunities inherent in the agreement. In his address the chairman Bompai/Jigawa Branch, Sani Hussien Saleh, called on the governments of Kano and Jigawa states to step-up support for local manufacturers in the their states emphasizing on the need for the federal government to ensure steady power supply to business areas in the states.
