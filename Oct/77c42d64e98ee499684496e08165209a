The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has warned that it would not accept any form of attack on its personnel, ad hoc staff or materials to be deployed for the Bayelsa Nov. 16, governorship election. INEC Chairman Prof. Mahmood Yakubu gave the warning on Tuesday in Yenegoa during the commission’s interactive session with members of the state Traditional Rulers Council. Yakubu said in addition to the governorship election, INEC would also conduct Brass II State Constituency Election in Brass Local Government Area (LGA) on the same day.

He said that as an honest broker, INEC was committed to conducting free, fair, credible, conclusive and acceptable election in the state. Yakubu said that while INEC was ready for credible election, the attitude of political class remained a source of concern to the commission. “We are concern about utterances likely to breach peace during campaign, on election day and during collation of results. “Let me remind the candidates that the commission working with the security agencies will not accept attack on the people that will be engaged on election day. “We are going to engage over 10,000 young Nigeria across the state. “We are concerned on mobilisation of armed persons to voting and collation centres as we experienced in previous elections,” he said. Yakubu commended the traditional rulers for their continuous support to INEC including the mobilisation of their subjects to register and collect their Permanent Voters’ Cards(PVCs) as well as advocacy for peaceful election. He urged them to continue with the advocacy for peaceful election.
