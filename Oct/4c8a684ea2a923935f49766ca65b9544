He said Galaxybackbone’s data centre is one of the best in the country and it provides services for all the government agencies across the country. OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY According to him, the centre has been helping immensely in the FG’s e-government process. In his response, the Prof Danbatta described the data centre is a national asset of significant proportion. He said: ‘’It’s very pleasing to see an agency of government competing with some of the best service providers in the sector, it doesn’t happen like this normally, this is credit to your CEO and his team. ‘’We will continue to patronise Galaxy in the strength of sheer quality of service. We commend you in the area of complementing what NCC is doing in the area of broadband penetration this has lessened our work. You have laid total fibres of 3,000-4,000km, the figure of 42,000km that we give from time to time is including the component of fibre that Galaxy bone has laid.’’  Why we want to engage more with private sector – Galaxy Backbone Benue embraces ICT driven economy for growth FG to spend N65bn on broadband infrastructure
