The Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster and Social Development, Hajia Sa’adiya Umar Faruq, was turned back from defending 2020 budget by the joint senate committee on poverty alleviation. The committee’s action, according to the chairman, Sen. Lawan Yahaya Gumau, was for the failure of the ministry to provide the committee with the 2019 budget forward presentation. Gumau, who spoke on top of his voice said the committee will no longer tolerate the rude behaviour of the two Special Advisers to president Muhammadu Buhari that accompanied the Minister for the defense. “Hon Minister, we know you are new but the two SAs knew very well that the 2019 budget must be presented before 2020. We didn’t persuade them to bring it to the 2019 budget defense. We have tolerated them before and bring ourselves down in the interest of this country,” he said He rescheduled the defense session to 10:00 am on Monday and warned that all the budget’s documents must be available to the committee on the appointed date. “I apologised to the minister being that she was new, but for the two SAs I am not apologising,” he added. In her response, the minister apologised to the committee for not providing the hard copy of the 2019 budget. “The hard copy of the 2020 budget submitted earlier was attached with a flash drive that contains the 2019 budget,” she explained.
