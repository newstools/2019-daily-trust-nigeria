Candido said the council and the FCT IRS would be collaborating in the collection of some taxes which included advertisement and signage. He urged the council’s revenue department and other business outlets including AMAC Microfinance Bank, AMAC Investment, Property and Development Company and AMAC Marshall to assist in boosting the council’s revenue base. “We meant well when we established these outlets and we want them to outlive this administration so that generations to come will benefit from them. “But we cannot survive without finance and that is why I want them to be up to the task so that our revenue flow can be encouraging,” he said.
