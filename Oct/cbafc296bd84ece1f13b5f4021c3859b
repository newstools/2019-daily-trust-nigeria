Fourteen aggrieved members of the Edo State House of Assembly operating under the aegis of Integrity Group yesterday told Governor Godwin Obaseki that they have no intention of impeaching him. The spokesman of the group, Mr Washington Usifo, who addressed journalists in Abuja, said the fear of impeachment must have led Governor Obaseki to breach the law on the inauguration of the assembly. Usifo said: “First, it is not strange, this is not the first time we are hearing something like this. The question is we are not aware of anything that he has done that will make us impeach him. “We do not intend to do that.  Our duty is to come, join an assembly duly inaugurated to enable us discharge our duties to pave way for good governance. “So, I think such thought operates only in the head of some persons. But again, on the mandate given to me by my people, we are not aware, we are not part of it, it is strange to our thinking and conscience. So that should be discarded.” The legislators said Obaseki had done ‘’manifest injustice’’ to democracy for refusing to abide by the directive of the National Assembly to inaugurate the assembly in line with the dictates of the law. They said the action amounted to a brazen act of impunity in tandem with his desperate desire to achieve his second term agenda next year. The lawmakers called on the governor to see the need to uphold integrity and rule of law over and above any other inordinate ambition. They appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari, the National Assembly, as well as the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, to wade into the ongoing act of lawlessness being perpetrated in Edo State.
