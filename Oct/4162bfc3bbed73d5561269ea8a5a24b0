The National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, says the second term of President Muhammadu Buhari will be used to accelerate economic growth to meet the yearnings  of Nigerians. Oshiomhole said this yesterday in Abuja when a delegation from the Vietnamese Government led by Nguyen Hai Ninh, the Deputy Chief of Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam paid a visit to members of the National Working Committee (NWC).

Before the coming of President Buhari, we have missed a lot of opportunities. “We had challenges in power supply and of course, we have our own share of security challenges. And of course, the President had to fight corruption so that few people cannot take the wealth of this nation. Nigerians voted overwhelmingly for our President, so we are going to take advantage of this second term to ensure that we accelerate economic growth so that we will meet the needs of our people,” he said. Nguyen Hai Ninh, who spoke earlier, said they were on the visit to establish official relationship between the APC led government and the communist party of Vietnam. Soliciting for the assistance of Nigeria in settling the crisis between Vietnam and China over the disputed South China Sea, he advised Nigeria to insist that the dispute be settled according to the UN established laws Buhari promises to assemble strong team, unveils agenda APC crisis: Nabena wants President Buhari to step in 2019: Obasanjo plotting 3rd term agenda through backdoor, says Oshiomhole
