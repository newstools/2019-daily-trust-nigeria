The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has called on religious leaders in Kogi State to help sensitise their followers on the need for peaceful governorship election in the state on November 16. INEC’s Resident Electoral Commissioner in Kogi Prof James Apam made the call at the weekend during an interactive session with religious leaders and faith-based groups. He said the malaise of violence, ballot box snatching, harassment of electoral officials and vote buying were of concern to the commission as they hamper conduct of credible, free and fair elections. He also appealed to the religious leaders to educate their followers on how to vote properly to avoid cases of void votes. Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in Kogi State, Bishop John Ibenu in his remarks, assured the commission of its support in sensitising followers on the need for peaceful election. He said they will be bringing together youths from across the 21 local government areas of the state to enlighten them ahead of the poll. On his part, the State Chairman of Jama’atul Nasril Islam (JNI), Amb Usman Bello, urged security agencies to provide adequate security and that the commission should ensure justice and fair play in terms of its conduct throughout the poll.
