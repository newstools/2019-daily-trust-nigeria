Young entrepreneurs with talent in making Nigerian cuisines were yesterday showcased to commemorate the 2019 National Food Day which comes up on Thursday, October 24. The entrepreneurs displayed different kinds of Nigerian cuisines that can favourably compete with international cuisines across the world at the second edition of the National Unity Food Fair organised by the National Council of Women Societies (NCWS). The Minister of Women Affairs, Mrs. Pauline Tallen, said the food fair was Nigeria’s way of joining other countries of the world to celebrate the International Day of Rural Women (IDRW) with the theme: “Rural Women and Girls Building Climate Resilience”. OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY Mrs. Tallen said one of the end products in the agricultural value chain was food processing and consumption, and added that she was confident that the food fair would give credence to the idea that women were at the core of President Muhammadu Buhari’s transformational advances in agriculture and rural development. The President of NCWS, Mrs. Laraba Shoda, said the programme represented their little effort at complementing the effort of government towards achieving food sufficiency and security for Nigerians. The food fair is aimed at highlighting and promoting some popular Nigerian dishes from various sections of the country, encourage culinary exchange among Nigerian ethnic groups for unity and to identify and empower women with talents for the Nigerian cuisines. ‘Support women to showcase local cuisine, promote food culture’ 70% of Nigeria smallholder farmers are women – Minister NCWS holds 2nd national food fair
