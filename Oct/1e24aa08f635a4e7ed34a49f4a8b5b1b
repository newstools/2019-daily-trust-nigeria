Residents of Kaduna State have reacted to the planned introduction of air shuttle from Kaduna to Abuja. Governor of Kaduna State, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, last Wednesday signed an MOU with a private firm for the introduction of air shuttle from the Kaduna to Abuja. Some residents who spoke with our correspondents said while it is a good idea, it will only serve the interest of a certain class of people.

He said: The security situation is very bad, especially on the Kaduna to Abuja road. Everyday, you hear stories of kidnap, so that is why they are introducing the air shuttle. But the poor man cannot afford it’’. Babangida Ibrahim, a tailor, said it was a welcome idea, but that majority of people in the state cannot afford it. “The best thing I can say is for the government to put in more efforts on the issue of security so that the road will be safe,” he said. Faiza Abdulwahab, a makeup artist said, “my take is that they should work on the road; clear the bushes and make everyone safe. The government can also join hands with international organisations to improve security. Now, as an average citizen, I cannot afford probably N10,000 or N15,000 for a flight when the fare for road trip is just N1,500,” Another resident, Jimon Dauda, said the idea is good if the cost is moderate. For Godwin Idika, the development will cause more people to visit Kaduna. “People will be shipping goods down here, so it is a very good development and I know that El-Rufai is doing well’’. The Kaduna- Abuja road recently became one of the most dangerous routes in Nigeria, with kidnappers carrying out regular attacks.
