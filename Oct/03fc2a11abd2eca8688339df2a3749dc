The Senate yesterday passed the Deep Offshore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contract (Amendment ) Bill 2019. Senate President Ahmad Lawan said: “The bill must be passed and concurred to, by the House of Representatives and of course, assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari who is on the same page with us on it. “As a patriotic Senate, there is no way we would have yielded to such pressures and deny our dear country  $1.5billion that will be accruing into her account on yearly basis based on contractual sharing agreements put in place by the new provisions which become laws when finally assented to by the president.” OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY  Ita-Giwa, Uba task new legislators on independence JUST IN: 5 bills scale first reading at Senate Senate to amend Production Sharing Contract Act
