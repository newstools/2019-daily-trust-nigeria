A 27-year-old sales boy who damaged a N2.5 million display glass box got a reprieve yesterday as an Igbosere Magistrate Court in Lagos threw out the case against him, but with a warning: go and sin no more. Isaiah Effiong Ikpong landed in trouble on October 16, 2019 when he broke the box in anger. Ikpong, a former staff at Flavour Umami Restaurant, at Elegushi I-mate, Lekki, Eti-Osa Local Government, Lagos State, was said to have gotten angry when other members of staff were receiving their salaries but he hadn’t received an alert to that effect by 15 October 2019.

He was to realise later that the salary alert had come in the previous night. When the accused person was arrested by the police, he agreed to pay for the damaged glass, but the complainant, A. Ekpak, told Ikpong that even if he worked for three years, his salary wouldn’t be able to pay for the item. Although Ikpong pleaded guilty as charged, the complainant withdrew the charge following court intervention and the matter was struck out.
