The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kebbi State has suspended Alhaji Shafiu Abubakar Zauro, a former domestic aide to  the minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami. The party said Zauro was suspended over alleged “unguarded utterances” on federal allocations to local governments in the state. But Zauro, while reacting to his suspension, said the APC ward executive in the state lacked the constitutional power to suspend him. He stated that he was not invited for hearing as stipulated by the party’s constitution.
