Veterinary Services Department of the Agriculture and Rural Development Secretariat has commenced free vaccination for dogs and cats in the FCT. Director of Veterinary Services Department of the Agriculture and Rural Development Secretariat, Dr.  Regina Adulugba, disclosed this while addressing veterinary officers of the secretariat at the start of the exercise at the FCT Veterinary Clinic in Nyanya, Abuja. According to her, there has been an upsurge in rabies outbreak in the FCT in recent times and that the secretariat was in addition to the daily routine clinical vaccination exercise embarking on a campaign to sensitise FCT residents on the importance of vaccinating their animals. OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY She asked residents to be wary of  the disease as it is fatal and is mpossible to cure once it begins to manifest. “I am calling on all residents not just dog and cat owners to be cautious because as at the moment, there has not been any confirmed cure for the disease. It is important to note also that not just dogs, even cats can be carriers of the rabies virus so our best bet is to annually vaccinate these animals”.
