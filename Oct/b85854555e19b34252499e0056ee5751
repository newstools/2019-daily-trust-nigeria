Ahead of the November 16 election in Kogi, some members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Omala LGA of the state have defected to the APC. A former chairman of the LGA, Alih Ajuh, led other members of PDP including youth and women leaders as well as party faithful from across the wards in the LGA to the APC at a ceremony held in Abejukolo. Receiving the defectors, the Administrator of Omala LGA, Ibrahim Aboh, charged the new entrants to maintain high sense of integrity and party loyalty to ensure the smooth re-election of the APC candidate, Governor Yahaya Bello and his running mate, Chief Edward David Onoja, in the forthcoming governorship election.
