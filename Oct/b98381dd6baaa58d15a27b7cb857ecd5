The co-founder of the Young Democratic Party (YDP) and its governorship candidate for this year’s general elections in Akwa Ibom State, Arch. Nya Ezekiel Etuk, has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to reject calls for the de-registering of political parties. Nigeria currently has 91 registered political parties, leading to calls for de-registration of many of them for non-viability. Etuk, who was also the pioneer National Chairman of YDP, told newsmen yesterday in Abuja that the Chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, should ignored calls for the nation’s political parties to be reduced to only five.
