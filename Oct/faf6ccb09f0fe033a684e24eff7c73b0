The Director General Borno Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture(BOCCIMA) Arc. Abdullahi Usman, has urged management of the Development Bank of Nigeria to consider the predicament and suffering of the North-East region and lower his requirements for accessing loan. Arc. Abdullahi stated this during the DBN MSME summit with theme ‘The Role of Development Banks in Financial Inclusion’ in Maiduguri yesterday. He lamented that only about 50,000 businessmen were registered with BOCCIMA, leaving so many more thousands still unregistered as a result of high level of illiteracy in the region. “The impact is great, they have enlightened our business community on the channel and methods of doing modern business. “Let me tell you, 80 percent of the  business community in this state is illiterate, yet they are required to bring tax clearance and others; so many of them have not even registered their companies so how can they access the loans,” he queried. “So we are begging the lending institutions to give special treatment with regard to meeting requirements for loans to us in Borno due to our predicament; there should be special consideration for the North-East region,” he pleaded. “If the Development Bank of Nigeria wants to help our people it should be able to look at their predicament and not take advantage of their predicament. “If you are dealing with people that are illiterate you don’t ask them to bring O’Level or BSC results when you fully know that they never attended school. Instead of asking them to bring their profile and tax clearance they should ask Borno Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture(BOCCIMA) to stand for them as guarantor. “This is the kind of policy we want them to look into instead of giving us straight jacket policy,” Arc. Usman said. Why small businesses have trouble getting loans SME loans: Collateral, registration still hurdles in 980 MFBs Tofa canvasses for Islamic banks in north
