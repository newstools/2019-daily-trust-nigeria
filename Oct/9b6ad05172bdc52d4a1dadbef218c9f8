A mother of one, Mrs Kemi Lawal, has filed a suit seeking the dissolution of her seven-year- old marriage with Musiliu Lawal. Kemi, who appeared before an Ake, Abeokuta, Ogun State, customary court yesterday, alleged threat to her life in the marriage. She said that her husband was stubborn and quarrelsome, and had not been taking care of the only child in the marriage.
