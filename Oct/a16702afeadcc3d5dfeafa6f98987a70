The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which is the global body that sets standard for open and accountable management of oil, gas and mineral resources will now require countries to have a beneficial ownership register as part of the criteria to scale through its validation. EITI which Nigeria is a member requires that by 2020, all its member countries ensure that companies that apply for or hold oil, gas or mining license disclose their beneficiaries or real owners. Speaking at a stakeholders’ workshop to operationalise beneficial ownership reporting in Nigeria, the Director Legal Services of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), Mr. Peter Ogbobine said having a beneficial ownership register is now going to be a criteria for EITI validation.

The country risks losing the impressive ranking should the register fail to be in place. The workshop held in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State is the second of such. Ogbobine said having the register was going to be of immense benefit in the fight against corruption. Dr. Mike Uzoigwe of the Facility for Oil Sector Transformation (FOSTER) said it is supporting the process around beneficial ownership reporting because getting to know the real owners of companies in the extractive sector will help the country improve the sector management.
