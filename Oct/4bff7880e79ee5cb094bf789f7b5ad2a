The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), University of Ibadan chapter, on Tuesday, said its members were not among the arrested staffers of the Distance Learning Center, University of Ibadan, over corruption. The Chairman, ASUU UI, Prof. Deji Omole, while reacting to some newspaper reports, said those arrested by the DSS were non-academic staff in the technical unit of the DLC. Omole lashed out at the Director of Public Communications of the University, Olatunji Oladejo, who some papers attributed the story to, as misinforming the public.
