Zamfara State House of Assembly is considering a bill to make bandits, cattle rustlers and kidnappers face capital punishment towards tackling the insecurity in the state. Spokesman of the assembly, Mustapha Jafaru Kaura, told Daily Trust that such crimes have no specific punishment as provided by law, therefore death penalty for the perpetrators could stem them. He said the state assembly had last Wednesday received an executive bill prohibiting banditry, cattle rustling, cultism, kidnapping and terrorism law and that it had gone for first reading. Gov.
