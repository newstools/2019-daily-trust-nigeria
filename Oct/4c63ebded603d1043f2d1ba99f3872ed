Democracy Vanguard of Nigeria in Diaspora (DVND) has urged the Supreme Court to remain impartial, imperial and unperturbed as it handles the tussle over the outcome of the presidential elections. A statement jointly signed yesterday by DVND President Timothy Sule; Director Outreach, Prince Leonard Ishiguzo; and North America Coordinator, Yakubu Mohammad called on the international community and the African Union (AU) to ensure that the independence of the judiciary remained sacrosanct and inalienable. The organization expressed concern that since the tribunal gave its judgement on September 11, 2019, the appeal is yet to be heard when the statute of limitation for appeal at the Supreme Court is 60 days.
