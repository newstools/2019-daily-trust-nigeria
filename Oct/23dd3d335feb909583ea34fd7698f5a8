The Government of Bangladesh is seeking partnership with the Nigerian government in developing the Nigerian textile industry. Daily Trust reports the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is championing textile reawakening in Nigeria with about N100bn investments down the textile value chain. The High Commissioner of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh to Nigeria Mr. Shameem Ahsan, made the call in an interactive session business and other journalists in Abuja yesterday. He said Bangladesh with the second largest garment industry in the world, second to China with at least 5 million people working in the industry in that country, has useful experiences it can share in Nigeria. He also indicated that the textile industry can help Nigeria close gender parity gap as 80 percent of the 500 million textile workers in Bangladesh are women. While making reference to the power sector of Bangladesh which had risen in recent times to 22, 000 megawatts from 5, 000 megawatts in 2009, he stressed that Bangladesh would support the Nigerian government in achieving its target.
