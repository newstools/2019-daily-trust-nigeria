The Nigerian Aviation Handling Company Plc (NAHCO aviance) has said it will support the Federal Government in its determination to diversify the economy by providing the infrastructure that would boost food export business. The Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, NAHCO, Mrs. Tokunbo Fagbemi in a recent statement said, “We are providing facilities that will encourage cold storage management. In a few months we are creating cold storage hub for both existing and potential clients, including our new clients that want to trans-ship their goods through Nigeria with a bit of packaging.” She said the agency has gotten approval to develop a facility in our packaging warehouse, which will tackle that challenge because it will help exporters to package their products at a particular temperature rate to reduce the incidence of rejection in the international markets.

Fagbemi agreed with the Federal government that agriculture must be seen as a business and haven for investment and integrating food production, storage, food processing and industrial manufacturing to establish the linkage necessary in the agricultural commodity value chain. “Our new equipment and technology would enable us to improve on its offerings to its clients, as NAHCO had recently invested about N1.9bn in equipment. The overhaul would help to replace ageing equipment which had increased maintenance cost due to high utilisation of fuel” Fagbemi said.
