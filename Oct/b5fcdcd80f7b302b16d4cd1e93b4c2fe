The General Manager of Osun Agency for Community and Social Development Project (Osun-CSDP), Mrs. Funmi Abokede, has expressed worry that persons with disability have always been the first target of poverty in the communities and called for collective efforts to end poverty. She said this at the school for Persons with Special Needs in Osogbo, Osun State, during the commemoration of 2019 International Day of Poverty Eradication and Sensitization of Communities and Vulnerable Groups against Poverty. The theme of the event was “Acting Together to Empower Children, their Families and Communities to End Poverty”. During the event, children displayed their talents in singing and dancing, with a new set of musical instruments procured for them by OSUN-CSDP. They also performed drama to the admiration of their parents and other guests who visited the school to identify with them on the occasion. Abokede explained that the musical instruments were procured for the children because research has proved that music is a good therapy for persons living with disabilities. According to her, music lifts their spirit, makes them happy, stabilises their emotion and mitigates their psychological trauma. The teachers and parents of the children with special needs lauded Osun-CSDP for identifying with the special children. They also expressed gratitude to the state government for providing for the needs of the children and reducing the burden on their parents. Abokede noted that Osun State Governor, Mr Gboyega Oyetola, was determined to make life better for people of the state.
