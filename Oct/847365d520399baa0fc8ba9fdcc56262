The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Non-National Working Committee (NWC) National Executive Committee (NEC) Members Forum has called on the “founding fathers and leaders to salvage the party from “possible imminent cracks”. The fissures, it said would result from the way the ruling party is being currently managed by the leadership. The forum, in a communiqué issued yesterday in Abuja and jointly signed by Nelson Alapa, chairman and Omolaoye Akintola, secretary, accused the NWC under the leadership of Adams Oshiomhole of usurping the powers of the NEC.

The group said quarterly NEC meetings through which issues affecting the general and specific needs of the party could be deliberated upon, as provided for in Article 25(8i) of the Constitution, have never been honoured since the inception of the present leadership. It called on all the key stakeholders to ensure that Board of Trustees/National Elders Council as the case maybe was constituted within a reasonable timeframe to enhance party status and operations. Meanwhile, the former chairman of the forum, Alhaji Nasiru Danu, has been appointed as the forum’s grand patron.
