Mr Sylvanus Unogu, the former Director, Population Management, National Population Commission (NPC) on Wednesday reiterated the need for the country to conduct headcount (census) for national planning. Unogu told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja that only a reliable headcount of Nigerian citizens would enhance proper budgetary allocations. He said that census, which was long overdue in the country, had the capacity of driving development at the grassroots with accurate population data.

He explained that census, if properly conducted, would engender prosperity through Demographic Dividend (DD). According to him, census will enable government to know the population distribution and will emphasise on the weaknesses and strength. The former director, who expressed optimism in the capacity of National Population Commission to deliver to conduct credible headcount, called for synergy with stakeholders. NAN reports that Nigeria had her last official census in 2006, making it imperative to have another one, due to population increase.
