An Igando Lagos Customary Court has dissolved the marriage between a 31-year-old woman, Lydia George Uwaru, and Mr. Daniel Chinedu Nwaru. The lady had sought divorce for lack of care, lack of appreciation and laziness. Lydia, a resident of No. 39 Funmi Alaka Street, Egan, Lagos, who works with an oil company said her husband has abdicated his responsibility of caring for her and her children. She said, “he is very lazy and he is not ready to do any work. When I complained about his idleness, he turned it to a fight. Thirdly, he does not appreciate all my efforts of providing for the family. Lastly, there is no more love between us.” She said Nwaru usually assaults her at the slightest provocation apart from the fact that he has not been living up to his responsibilities. Ever since we got married, I have been the one feeding the family, paying the rent, and the child’s school fees. According to her, she made several efforts to engage her estranged husband but all the monies she raised for him went down the rain. “I want the court to dissolve the marriage, so that I can start a new life and take care of myself and our child since my husband is not ready to do any work and I want the court to grant me the custody of my child,” she said. The respondent did not appear in court. The court president Barrister Koledoye Festus Adeniyi granted the prayers of the petitioner and pronounced the marriage dissolved while granting the custody of the only child to the petitioner until she attained the age of maturity.
