The Secretary General of the International Young Catholic Students (IYCS), Richard Francis Apeh, has challenged youths all over the world to be peace advocates, as it is the only act that can guarantee a positive future for them. Apeh threw the challenge at the 16th International World Council/Global Training Session of the IYCS held in Abuja. “I feel disappointed whenever I see you, young people just sitting back and hoping for a good future which I feel cannot be possible.

The IYCS international chaplain, Fr. Charles Menezes, said the world has reached a stage where youths are victims of every ugly situation, ranging from unemployment, education, climate change among other negatives. Menezes said the IYCS has the sole responsibility to guide youths accordingly to react to these misfortunes in a positive manner and mentor them to be great minds in the future. The International conference which had the theme “Taking Action for Peace, Here and Now” had participants from France, Germany, Rwanda among others.
