Indigenes of Itapaji Ekiti, in Ikole Local Government Area, Ekiti State, have lauded the state governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, for completing and commissioning the community’s civic centre, which construction was started 50 years ago. The commissioning was part of the activities marking the first anniversary of the Fayemi administration, as the people, led by their traditional ruler, the Olu of Itapaji, Oba Azeez Adebanjo, danced in appreciation of the completion and inauguration of the project. Playing Oliver Twist, the community urged the governor to assist the town to also complete the bridge linking the town with Iyemero-Ekiti and neighbouring Kwara State.

The community’s spokesman, Chief Michael Ogundana, said the foundation of the project was laid in 1968 and was stalled until Fayemi stepped in. Ogundana urged the state government to also construct the Itapaji-Omu road and restore the police post to boost security in the area. On behalf of Gov Fayemi, his deputy, Chief Bisi Egbeyemi said government would look into the community’s other demands, as the incumbent administration was poised for more developments in rural communities in the state. Egbeyemi said, “Concerning bridges destroyed by flood, they are receiving our attention and work will begin on them very soon. The Governor needs your support because he has the interest of Ekiti and its people at heart.”  Fayemi flags off N213.6m community projects in Ekiti Ekiti recommends more police posts in boundary communities APC accuses Fayose of abandoning  Fayemi’s  projects
