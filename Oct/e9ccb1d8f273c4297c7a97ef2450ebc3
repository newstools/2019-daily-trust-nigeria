The Chairman Kuje Area Council, Abdullahi Suleiman Sabo, has urged religious leaders to pray for him to overcome security challenges in the council. Sabo made the call when he received the leadership of St. Kizito Catholic Church who paid him a courtesy call in his office yesterday. He said there was the need for all religious leaders to assist the government to overcome forces of destruction by enlightening their members and followers to guard against religious extremism and terrorism. He said Christian leaders have a duty to promote the principles and tenets of Christianity as a religion of peace and justice. The chairman said those who kidnapped innocent people to collect ransom do not belong to any religion but are ‘‘terrorists who should be identified and fought until they give up their evil ways.’’ He described Christianity as a religion of peace and unity, while commending the Parish Priest, Rev. Dr. Hyacinth Okafor, for his support during the electioneering campaign period. Earlier in his remarks, Fr. Okafor said he led members of the parish to congratulate the chairman on his victory during the last council election in the area.
