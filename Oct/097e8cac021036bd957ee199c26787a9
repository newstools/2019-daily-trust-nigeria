The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has urged youths to shun all acts of violence before, during and after the November 16th governorship election in Kogi. INEC’s Resident Electoral Commissioner in Kogi, Prof James Apam, made the call in Lokoja on Thursday during a sensitisation workshop organised by the commission for youth organisations and groups on how to ensure a violent-free governorship election in the state. He said the Commission could only conduct credible, free and fair elections under a peaceful atmosphere, urging the participants to sensitise their peers on the need to avoid being used as agent of violence during the election.
