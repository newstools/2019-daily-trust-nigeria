The Public and Private Development Centre (PPDC) has called on governments to amend laws to apportion certain percentages to women in the contracting process and provide access to funding opportunities for them to venture into procurement. Presenting findings in Abuja yesterday, from a research project on women in the formal and informal sectors, the Programme Director, Ifeoma Onyebuchi, said PPDC is advocating the reduction and or waiver of tax rates on small businesses to help them thrive and bid for contracts. Findings from the research indicated that women are often sidelined in the public procurement process as a result of various factors. Some include lack of access to information, technology, cultural bias and lack of understanding of the contracting process.
