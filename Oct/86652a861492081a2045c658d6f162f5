Gunmen suspected to be kidnappers have, in a fresh incident, abducted a police inspector simply identified as Selven and a man identified as Nengba Mundi in Rubochi community in Kuje Area Council of the FCT. A resident of the community, who preferred anonymity, said the incident happened in the wee hours of Sunday at about 2: am when the gunmen in their large numbers bearing sophisticated weapons invaded the community. It is the third kidnap incident in less than a week in Rubochi village of Kuje area council. He said the gunmen first went to the house of the police inspector, forced the door open and whisked him away, before they proceeded to the house of the second victim and also took him away at gunpoint. According to him, the gunmen ordered the inspector to hand over the rifle he used for patrol on Friday to them but the inspector replied to them that he had already returned the rifle to the police station. Our reporter reliably gathered that the police inspector and one other victim may be at the same camp where the younger brother of the former chairman of the council, Alhaji Mohammed Abdullahi Galadima, is being held. It would be recalled that the younger brother of the former council chairman, Mohammed Abdullahi Galadima, was on Saturday abducted in the area by gunmen. When contacted, the acting spokesman of the FCT police command, ASP Maryam Yusuf, said she was not aware of the latest kidnap incident, but said she would find out and get back to our reporter.
