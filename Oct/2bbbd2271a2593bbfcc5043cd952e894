The Police Service Commission yesterday dissociated itself from a purported list of candidates scheduled for training allegedly released by the Nigeria Police Force in respect of the recruitment exercise into the constable cadre of the Force. The spokesman of the commission, Ikechukwu Ani, in a statement, described the list released by the police as illegal and a serious breach of the Federal Character requirements. He said urged the public to be wary of the list as the commission would soon resume the remaining stages of the recruitment process and release the authentic list of successful candidates, local government by local government.

Ani stated: “It is unfortunate that despite the pendency of the court processes, Nigeria Police Force went ahead to release a purported list of candidates it has invited for training. “The commission wishes to state that the list is unknown to it as it believes it is a product of illegality. The hearing for the commission’s suit has been scheduled for Wednesday, October 23rd at the Federal High Court 5, Abuja.”  Police recruitment: Police Service Commission disowns list Impasse between Police Commission, Police stalls recruitment Commission halts police recruitment
