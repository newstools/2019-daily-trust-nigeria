The TechnoServe and Citi Foundation has empowered over 300 micro-retailers and unemployed youths to commemorate the successful completion of the second phase ofÂ  Pan-African Youth Entrepreneur Development (PAYED 2) programme in Nigeria. The programme is part of a regional initiative to harness entrepreneurship to generate better economic opportunities for young people in four African countries. It focuses on improving the operations and growth of unemployed youths to develop their mindset and skills needed to enter the workforce or start their own businesses. The contact person for the foundation, Ayokanmi Ayuba, said 78 percent of those empowered are women resident in Abuja and Enugu.
