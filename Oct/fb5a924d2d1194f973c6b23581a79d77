A 30-year-old man, Adeniyi Oladayo, has been arraigned before an Ado-Ekiti Chief Magistratesâ€™ Court over a fraud of N1 million. The police prosecutor, Inspector Caleb Leranmo, informed the court that the defendant, who is of no fixed address and others at large committed the offence between January and October 2019 in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital. Inspector Leranmo, alleged that the defendant, who is a sales attendant at Total filling station, Adebayo, in Ado-Ekiti, fraudulently obtained the sum of N1 million against one Adeniran Ademola, from the sales of fuel he sold out within the period. The police prosecutor noted that the offence contravened section 1 (3) of the Advanced Fee Fraud and Other Related Offences Act 2006. The plea of the defendant was not taken in court, but his counsel, Mr. Olayemi Olatunde, applied for his bail, saying the complainant has retained the defendant so as to deduct the money monthly from his salary. The Chief Magistrate, Mr Abdulhamid Lawal, granted bail to the defendant in the sum of N250,000 with two sureties in like sum, saying one of the sureties must be a civil servant of grade level 10 and above.
