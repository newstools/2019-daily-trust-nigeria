Former Kano State governor, and leader of the Kwankwasiyya movement, Engineer Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso, has commissioned an ultra-modern nursing and midwifery college, which he constructed and furnished at Kwankwaso, his home town in Madobi Local Government Area of Kano State. The event was part of activities lined up to mark his 63rd birthday, Daily Trust gathered. Speaking to thousands of supporters gathered at the school premises to witness the ceremony, Senator Kwankwaso said instead of partying and hosting friends and family to lavish celebrations he chose to do something that would add value to the lives of the common man. He said taking into consideration the importance of the girl-child education, the college is purely for girls and that at present the school will admit only 50 students with the hope of increasing the number later.
