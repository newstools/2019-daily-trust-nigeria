The Dutsin-ma United for Peace and Stability Association, an NGO, has said that the Federal University Dutsin-ma faces an imminent collapse unless the federal government takes urgent action to remedy the situation. The chairman of the association, Sufyanu Amadu, alleged that there is a “deliberate  move’’ to destroy the university by some unscrupulous group of people both within and outside the institution. According to him, the institution is no longer functioning like other normal universities as rules and regulations are being serially violated. “Staff recruitment has now been taken over by employment racketeers in the campus. The university is indiscriminately admitting large number of students that are far beyond its carrying capacity and the governing council has been compromised,” Amadu alleged. He said what worried the association more was the non-challant attitude of the supervising ministry on the happenings in the institution. “It is in view of this that we are appealing to the state governor, Aminu Masari, and the  Acting Vice Chancellor, Umar Dangani, to correct the anomalies by repositioning the university for prosperous academic and administrative activities. When contacted the spokesman of the University, Habibu Matazu, asked the association to approach the new acting vice chancellor with their observations.
