National President of the Foundation for the Protection of Women and Children in Nigeria, Hajiya Ramatu Tijjani, has called on the federal government to construct more remand homes across the country as a way of curtailing the use of illegal rehabilitation centres. Reacting to the recent raids on rehabilitation  centres, also called torture homes, in Kaduna state, Hajiya Ramatu, further called on governors in the country to construct more juvenile remand homes  to curtail the activities of illegal torture centres. “The raid on various detention centres is a welcome development, but there is the need for government to build more remand training institutes so as to change the lives of youth for the better. “Building more juvenile remand centres by states and federal governments  will help to curtail the existence of traditional rehabilitation centres and other illegal places where hundreds of youths are being  kept in inhuman conditions,” she said. She attributed the high population of youths in such rehabilitation centres to the failure of parents to live up to their responsibility. “God will surely ask  every parent how he took care of his family.” Ramatu, who is also a specialist in conflict prevention in Africa said that there was the need for wealthy individuals and corporate organizations to support government’s effort.
