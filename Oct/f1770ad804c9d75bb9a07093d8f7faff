Youths of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa State have organized a solidarity walk/sensitization rally to garner support for the victory of their governorship candidate, Chief David Lyon and his running mate, Senator Biobarakumo Degi Eremieyeyo. The youths under the aegis of Sylva Youth Vanguard (SYV), numbering over 5000 drawn from the 105 wards in the state, who marched from state secretariat of the party along Mbiama- Yenagoa Road to Tombia Junction, promised to vote massively for the party’s candidate. Speaking during the rally, the director general of the SYV, Mr Joseph Kiyaramo, said the rally was a victory walk to rally support for the APC candidate, Chief David Lyon.

He described David Lyon as a humble, God fearing person and a philanthropist who is touched by the pains and suffering ordinary Bayelsans are passing through. “We are very happy because the solidarity/sensitization rally was a huge success and has received the support and blessings of Bayelsans. The mammoth crowd that waved and cheered us is a pointer that at the end of the day, come November 16, we are taking over government house,” he said.
