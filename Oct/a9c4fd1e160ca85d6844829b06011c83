The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has asked the National Assembly to sanitize the Presidential Villa by probing allegations of illegal allotment of offices and apartments to unauthorized persons, “including scammers and corruption fronts” in the Aso Rock. The PDP, in a statement on Tuesday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, specifically demanded the National Assembly to investigate the alleged abuse of office by President Buhari and apply appropriate sanctions following the alleged revelation that Buhari assigned official facilities in the villa to unauthorized persons that have no official roles in governance. The party described the dirty public fight between the First Lady, Aisha Buhari and President Buhari’s cousins, over rooms in the villa as disgraceful.

The PDP therefore, charges President Buhari to immediately apologize to Nigerians for his failures and be ready to vacate office for more competent hands, since it has become obvious that he is leading our country to nowhere. “The party however, urges Nigerians to remain calm as such provocative and disgraceful developments will soon come to an end with the retrieval of our stolen mandate at the Supreme Court,” the PDP said.
