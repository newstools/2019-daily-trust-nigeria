The Chairman, Governing Council, Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC), Hon. Babangida Nguroje, has said over 10,000 Jobs have been created in the country through the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) worth billions of dollars. He said on Sunday in Abuja that the successes recorded by the commission in attracting FDI in the country was due to the policy of the current administration to create an enabling environment for all genuine investors. He said the commission has lifted Nigeria among the top three most favourable countries in Africa in terms of ease of doing business.

Nguroje said that these achievements became possible because of the determination of the current administration to clear all hurdles that hitherto created stumbling blocks for both local and foreign investments across Nigeria. “We are satisfied that the current administration has provided opportunities for all investors to bring their businesses into the country as well as boost the micro economy as one of the most critical sectors,” the former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives said.  10,000 jobs created through foreign investment – Nguroje NIPC: Enhancing Nigeria’s investment climate Nigeria is Africa’s investment hub, Osinbajo tells investors
