Following the recent discovery of oil in Bauchi and Gombe states, the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA) has said oil companies must soon adopt oil spill contingency plans and strategies to adequately prepare for any eventuality. Director General and CEO of NOSDRA Mr. Idris O. Musa, who stated this at an interactive forum with media executives in Abuja, said the agency, which is under the supervision of the Federal Ministry of Environment, was established by Act No. 15 of 2006 and charged with implementing the National Oil Spill Contingency Plan (NOSCP). He said NOSDRA, which has the statutory mandate of oil spill management in Nigeria, has established good working relationship with security and law enforcement agencies in the vital area of tackling head-on the challenges of pipeline vandalism, crude oil theft and illegal refining. OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY Musa added that apart from the staggering amount of tax payerâ€™s money used to repair and replace the vandalised oil facilities to carry out effective cleanup of oil impacted sites, it is estimated that Nigeria loses billions of naira annually from crude oil theft.
