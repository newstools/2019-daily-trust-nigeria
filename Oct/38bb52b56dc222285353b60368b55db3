Senate President Ahmad Lawan has said competence, ability and inclusiveness rather gender should be the criteria for seeking political positions in the country. He made the remark in Abuja yesterday at the 3rd Osasu Show symposium with theme ‘The 21st Century Woman and her Role in National Development.” The symposium was convened by Osasu Igbinedion. Represented by Senator Betty Apiafi, Rivers West Senatorial District, the Senate president noted that in years past, women were seen to be more at household activities but at the turn of the 21st Century, their roles are better appreciated in many sectors. He pointed out that what nations do is to bring together gender differences and enhance them for a stronger society. The keynote speaker and former minister of Sports, Malam Bolaji Abdullahi, expressed dismay that since the return to democratic rule in 1999, women participation in politics has remained abysmal.
