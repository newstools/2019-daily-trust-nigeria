Senator Suleiman Asonya Adokwe who represented Nasarawa South Senatorial district in the 8th Senate has announced his retirement from active politics. Adokwe, a PDP member, made the announcement days after he was defeated at the Court of Appeal by Umaru Tanko Al-Makura of APC. “I’m very satisfied with myself; I was not rejected at the polls, everybody knows that, even the person who has taken away my mandate knows that he was not voted for. I just pray his conscience should allow him to do justice to the people of this zone by representing them effectively,” he said. He said, at 65, he would no longer contest in any election in the future, except certain situations warranted him to do so. “At 65, I cannot go and be hustling for electoral position again. I have reached a level that I should be an elder statesman but standing for an election is no longer in the pipeline,” he said On the appeal tribunal judgment, Senator Adokwe said he has accepted the will of God, having served for 12 years in the Senate. “I served for 12 years and remain eternally grateful to God and my people who have always elected me even in the last general elections. We abide by it, and we succumb to the will of God for us,” he said.
