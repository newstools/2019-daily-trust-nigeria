The Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the ruling APC, Mr Yekini Nabena, has said that plans by Governor Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa State to rig the November 16 governorship election, in favour of what he called his stooge, will fail. Nabena stated this while reacting to the violence that erupted in the state capital, Yenagoa on Monday after the disputed removal of the speaker of Bayelsa State House of Assembly. The Bayelsa-born politician, who said the disputed governorship candidate of the PDP would not win, raised an alarm over the level of insecurity in the state ahead of the election. He said information at his disposal has it that some elements of the PDP had mobilised thugs with dangerous weapons from neighbouring states to cause unrest in Bayelsa State ahead of the poll.

The wind of change is blowing across the state, regardless of party leanings,” Nabena said.
