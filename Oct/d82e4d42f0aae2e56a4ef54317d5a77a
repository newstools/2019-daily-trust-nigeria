National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, has expressed fear over the demand for his itinerary by Edo State Government. The Secretary to the State Government, Osarodion Ogie Esq., had in a statement condemned attempts to cause a resurgence of thuggery in Edo State and urged Oshiomhole, to always put the state chapter of the APC and the government on notice when visiting so that he can be accorded courtesies due him as a national figure. But the APC national chairman, who reacted yesterday through his Chief Press Secretary, Simon Ebegbulem, said they are even more scared now that the governor is making every effort to coerce the national chairman into giving him details of his movement in Edo State.
