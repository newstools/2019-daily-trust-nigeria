Politicians from the South East geopolitical zone are set to organise an event tagged ‘Abakaliki Retreat’ to strategise ahead of the 2023 presidential election. The event is fixed for Abakaliki, the Ebonyi State capital, next month. Although the agenda of the gathering was not disclosed, an inside source revealed to Daily Trust that how to produce Nigeria’s president of Igbo origin in 2023 would be the key issue to be discussed. Tagged ‘Igboezue Leadership Retreat’, a release from the retreat planning sub-committee on media and publicity, signed by Collins Steve Ugwu, stated that the event is powered by Nzuko Ummuna. The Nzuko Ummuna, said to be a core Igbo think tank of committed professionals at home and the diaspora, in alliance with the South East Governors’ Forum (SEGF), will hold at the ultramodern Ecumenical Centre in Abakaliki City.
