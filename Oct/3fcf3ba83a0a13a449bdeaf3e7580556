The uncle asked him to bring the boy so that he could be appreciated by the family. “However, the father of the victim observed that it was the same mobile phone number that was used to demand ransom. As such, SARS operatives were notified and they apprehended the suspect when he arrived with the boy,” Malum said. Speaking with newsmen, the suspect said he kidnapped the boy to raise money to take care of his siblings, who he said sometimes go without food for two days.  According to him, he could not further his education beyond secondary school and he doesn’t have a skill or capital to start a trade. The PPRO said investigation is still on-going and the suspect would be charged to court once it is completed.
