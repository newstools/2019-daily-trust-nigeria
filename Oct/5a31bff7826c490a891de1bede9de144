The All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in Bayelsa state, Chief David Lyon, has promised to protect and judiciously use the crude oil wealth of the state for the growth and development of the people if elected come November 16. Addressing a crowd of supporters at Egbema-Angalabiri community in Ekeremor Local Government Area of the state during a campaign rally, Lyon lamented that Bayelsans are still living in penury. This, he said, was as a result of the failure of the outgoing administration to protect and invest the common wealth of the people on profit generating projects, thereby causing the people to live from hand to mouth. He said Ekeremor local government has abundant crude oil deposits in several communities but that the level of development of the communities and the people did not reflect the true nature of their contributions to the wealth and economic growth of the nation. Speaking earlier, the coordinator of Lyon/Degi campaign in Ekeremor LGA, Mr. Bolous Miens, said the governorship hopeful has given youths of the area employment opportunities in Agip Oil Company and that he is confident that when he becomes governor, the rate of unemployment in the area would drop.
