A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and governorship aspirant in the September 3 primary in Bayelsa, Mr Keniebi Okoko, yesterday said the choice of Chief David Lyon as the candidate of APC for the November 16 governorship election has greatly reduced the chances of the party to win the poll. Okoko, while speaking with journalists in Yenagoa, also argued that the pockets of defections in PDP recently, was a blessing in disguise, because it has given the young and energetic youths in the party the opportunity to deploy their energies for the campaigns. The businessman-cum-philanthropist, who is a member of the PDP national and state campaign councils, explained that put Lyon and Diri side by side, the candidate of APC and his PDP opponent do not stand on the same pedestal given the PDP candidate’s intellectual ability and exposure. He urged the people of Bayelsa to make the right choice by voting Diri in the next election, arguing that making the wrong choice could portend grave danger for the state. Okoko, who came third during the PDP governorship primary last month, had immediately declared his support for the eventual winner, Douye Diri and pledged to work for the success of PDP. According to him, rather than hide behind the Minister of State, Petroleum, Chief Timipre Sylva, whom he described as intellectually sound, the APC candidate should come out in the open to tell the people of Bayelsa his plans and programmes.
