The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said it will not extend the September 30 deadline for the collection of the Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) in Bayelsa and Kogi states. The INEC National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee (IVEC), Mr. Festus Okoye, said this on Monday in Abuja. “We held market outreaches, we called some of the card owners on phone and we also sent out SMS to some of them. We approached community leaders in all those places, we also cascaded them to all the places we believe the owners of those PVCs are, so there is no reason whatsoever for extending the deadline for the collection of the PVCs, Okoye said.
