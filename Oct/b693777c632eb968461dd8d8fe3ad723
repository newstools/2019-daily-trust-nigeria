The 13-year-old marriage between Mrs Favour Solomon and her husband, Azeez Solomon, has been dissolved by an Ado-Ekiti customary court. The marriage between husband and wife was dissolved yesterday based on provocation, lack of care for the wife and their three children, as well as no peace of mind. Both parties had earlier given their evidence before the court on September 19, 2019. Favour, the petitioner, said she made efforts to make the marriage work, but didn’t succeed. “My husband is not taking up his responsibility as a man. He drops money anytime he wishes, but I am no longer bothered about the situation. “I was responsible for the payment of the children’s school until last year when I stopped and he started paying. Whenever he does something bad and I talk to him, he will tell me he will kill me and nothing will happen. “He likes going to a herbalist, especially when he is sick, and bringing black soap to the house. He doesn’t allow me access to his room, which he locks always,’’ the woman said. Solomon, 40, denied most of the allegations, saying he still loved his wife and urged the court to beg her on his behalf to come back home. The president of the court, Mrs Olayinka Akomolede, observed that the marriage had broken down irretrievably and ended it. Akomolede awarded custody of the children to Favour and ordered Solomon to be paying her the sum of N5,000 monthly on each of the children as feeding allowance. 27-year-old housewife seeks dissolution of 13-year-old marriage Court dissolves 10-year-old marriage in Ekiti Court dissolves 12-year-old marriage over husband’s infidelity
