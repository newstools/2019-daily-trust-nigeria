The House of Representatives Committee on Banking and Currency has said it will interface with the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele on the controversial charges on deposits and withdrawals introduced by the apex bank. Chairman of the Committee, Victor Nwokolo (PDP, Delta) disclosed this while reacting to reports that his committee had summoned the CBN Governor over the new bank charges. He said they only requested the CBN boss to interface with the committee to see how the cashless policy can affect Nigerians in terms of benefits or otherwise.

Our intention on this issue is simple and it simply aims at the possibility of Nigerians using the policy to their advantage. “By so doing, we’ll know where it bites most through the proposed interface with the governor and his officials. There was no place that we mentioned in the motion that the House was summoning the arrowhead of the Apex bank of the country”. The House recently passed a resolution rejecting the new CBN policy to charge 2 and 3% on deposits or withdrawal in excess of N500,000.
