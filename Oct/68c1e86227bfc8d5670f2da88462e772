The Dangote Tomato Processing Factory in Kano is set to commence packaging of tomato paste by 2020, the Managing Director (MD) of the company, Alhaji Abdulkarim Lawal Kaita, has said. Alh. Abdulkarim who made the disclosure yesterday while conducting members of Kano Concerned Citizens Initiative (KCCI) round the company, said the plant and other equipment for packaging of tomato would be installed in the company in 2020. He lamented that over 100 million tonnes of processed tomato was currently lying in the factory with no buyers, noting that “most of the companies that are into the business of packaging tomato prepared foreign processed tomato than indigenous.” OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY He explained that although the company was processing 40 trucks of tomato per day, the market was not favourable as indigenous factories that were into packaging stopped buying the raw materials from Dangote for the past four years. Earlier, the Chairman of KCCI, Alhaji Bashir Othman Tofa, said they were at the company for fact finding, noting that the initiative was formed purposely to help Kano indigenes that were into various businesses within and outside the state. Alh. Bashir explained that KCCI had so far visited 17 companies and other places of business owned by Kano indigenes with a view to accessing their conditions and see how the initiative could help them improve their businesses.
