Plateau State Governor, Simon Bako Lalong, has described former Head of State, General Yakubu Gowon (rtd), as a rare gift to not only Plateau State but Nigeria and the world. Lalong, who is the chairman, Northern Governors’ Forum, also described Gowon as a distinguished statesman, gentleman, prayer warrior and bridge-builder who continues to provide inspiration and hope for the nation as it wades through its challenges.
