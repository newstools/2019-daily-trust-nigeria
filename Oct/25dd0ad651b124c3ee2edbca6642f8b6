A Federal High Court in Abuja yesterday gave a final warning to the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission to produce the Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, as a witness in the ongoing trial of the Director-General of the National Broadcasting Commission , Ishaq Modibbo Kawu and two others alleged to have misappropriated the N2.5billion meant for the Digital Switch-Over project of the Federal Government. Justice Folashade Ogunbanjo-Giwa said the minister and one other were the two remaining witnesses in the trial of Kawu, Pinnacle Communications Ltd, Lucky Omoluwa, and Dipo Onifade in the 12-count charges preferred against them by the ICPC over the switch-over project. Justice Ogunbanjo-Giwa warned that failure of the ICPC to produce the minister and a bureau de change operator, who had already missed previous summons, at the next adjourned date, would result in the closure of their case.

The court adjourned the case to December 3, 4 and 5 for the prosecution to call its remaining witnesses.
