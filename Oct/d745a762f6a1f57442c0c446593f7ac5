The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said the All Progressives Congress (APC) will not score up to 20 percent of the votes in the November 16 Kogi and Bayelsa states governorship elections. The PDP in a statement yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan said the APC would also fail to attain the statutory 25 percent of the votes in two-third of local government areas of the states. The party claimed that it had the highest demography of members, supporters and volunteers in all the electoral units, wards and local government areas ready for the polls, adding that not even the APC’s recourse to violence, blackmail, manipulations and rituals can sway the resolve of the people in both states.
