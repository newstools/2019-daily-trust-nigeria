A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) stalwart and former special assistant on youth affairs to former Governor Sule Lamido, Hon Aminu Kasti, has called on the opposition to surrender to the will of the people by rallying round Governor Bala Muhammed to build a better Bauchi State. Kasti made the call while speaking to journalists in Dutse, saying that Bala’s style of leadership was a true reflection of PDP philosophy. He said it is now barely six months but the governor has restored the people’s confidence in government, adding that hope has been rekindled in the state. The “electorate have made a right choice in Bauchi State in the last general elections. Governor Bala Muhammad has proved to be a selfless, patriotic and committed leader. “The governor’s style of leadership has proved that PDP is the only answer for Nigeria’s problems. The 100 days achievement of the governor is overwhelming because it has surpassed the four years stewardship of the immediate past APC-led state government. “The people of Bauchi State have tested the APC and the result was a disaster. I am therefore advising the opposition party to choose the path of honour by joining hands with the winning team.” Bauchi State’s odd kind of governance Bauchi 2019: The imperative of Abubakar’s return PDP accuses APC leadership of complicity
