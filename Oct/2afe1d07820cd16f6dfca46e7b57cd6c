A Federal High Court sitting in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, has fixed today for hearing of the suit filed by the former Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Chief Ndutimi Alaibe, against the emergence of Senator Douye Diri as the governorship candidate of PDP. The court, presided over by Justice Jane Inyang, also issued an order for substituted service on the respondents after complaint by the counsel to PDP that they were not properly served. In the suit Alaibe, who was the first runner up in the September 3, 2019 governorship primary of PDP, challenged what he called the failure of the party to comply with the provisions of the Electoral Act, the PDP constitution and its guidelines.

Somina Johnbull, counsel to the applicant, told newsmen that the appearance in court was to seek the court ruling on means of properly serving some of the respondents. Alaibe had a fortnight ago dragged PDP to court over alleged manipulation of the processes adopted during the September governorship primaries in the state, alleging that he was brazenly robbed by allowing the emergence of Diri as flag bearer of the party.
