Senator representing Kaduna North Senatorial Zone, Sen. Suleiman Abdu Kwari, has urged the Federal Government to, in its bid to resolve the P& ID controversy, resist any attempt by some to fleece Nigeria. Senator Kwari, who is the chairman of the Senate Committee on Anti-Corruption and Financial Crime, in a
statement, said the Federal Government should do all within its power to prove the untoward processes that led to the problem in the first place. He said, though heartened to learn of the stay of execution granted Nigeria by the Uk Court over the matter, it was necessary to preserve the country’s God given resources from falling into the hands of underserving actors.
