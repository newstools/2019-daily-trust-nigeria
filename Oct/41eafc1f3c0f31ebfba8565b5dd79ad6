Director General of APC Governorship Campaign Organisation for the November 16 election in Kogi, Senator Smart Adeyemi, has said the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has not shown readiness for the forthcoming election. He said this yesterday in Lokoja after an audience with the First Secretary, British High Commission in Nigeria, Alistair Hodson, who was in Kogi to assess the political situation and level of preparedness ahead of the election. “The main opposition party in this election, the PDP is not ready for this election. We have it on good authority that they are planning mayhem to discredit this election. And that is why until today, they are not campaigning, you can’t see their posters and they are not talking. It is quite disturbing when you have your main opponent not talking,” he said.

Reacting to the claims of Adeyemi, the Deputy Director Public Communication of PDP governorship campaign council, Austin Okai, said the PDP was fully ready for the election and that the official flag off of its campaign holds this Friday in Lokoja. “After the flag off, we will not retreat again until Engr Musa Wada is declared governor of Kogi State,” he said. Okai said the allegation of PDP planning mayhem was untrue, adding that rather, it was APC that had been unleashing violence against its members and destroying the party’s campaign posters. He said the party has been on with its “door to door” campaign and urged the ruling APC to await its “looming defeat” in the forthcoming election.
