Governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Bayelsa State, Senator Douye Diri, has promised to tackle the challenges facing Ogbia Local Government Area of the state – former President Goodluck Jonathan’s area – if elected in the November 16, 2019 election in the state. Diri, during a campaign at Ogbia town yesterday, assured that he would tackle the perennial flooding facing the area by dredging and sand filling affected areas; construct internal roads, provide youths and women with soft loans to start businesses and renovate dilapidated schools. The PDP candidate who stormed the area barely few days after the APC candidate’s rally, enjoined the people of Ogbia not to fall prey to the antics of the opposition APC who, he said, had no solution to the various challenges facing the state. “We are on ground here. I am a village boy, I have travelled around Ogbia. I know that in this season the major problem is flooding; flood has taken over Ayama and surrounding villages. So we are going to tackle the problem by sand filling and dredging these places. “We want to give the women and youths the source of living by granting them soft loans without interest,” he said. The paramount ruler of Otuokppti community in Ogbia local government, Chief Azibakayam Wongo, urged the people to turn out to vote the PDP candidate to ensure continuity.
