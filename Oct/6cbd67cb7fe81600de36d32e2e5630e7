The Code of Conduct Bureau says the level of compliance with the declaration of assets by public office holders  in the country is not encouraging at all. Prof. Mohammed Isah, Chairman of the bureau, disclosed this when he featured on News Agency of Nigeria Forum in Abuja. According to him, even though there is an improvement from what it used to be in time past, there is need for all public officers to know that they are duty bound to declare their assets.
