The Edo State Chapter of the All Progressive Congress (APC) has declared a group, Edo Peoples Movement, within the party in the state as unconstitutional as such group is not supported by the party’s constitution. A statement Friday signed by the state chairman of the party, Anselm Ojezua, and made available to journalists warned that the party will not allow the reckless antics of selfish individuals to dictate the fortunes of the party. He said the party will take decisive action against members who are trying to divide the party.

According to him, the party does not have provision for groups such as the one in question and that as a result of that such a group or movement was antithetical to the unity and stability of the Party. 2016 Governorship: Political activities resurrect in Edo Third party creating problem between Obaseki, Oshiomhole – APC Don''t select candidates on cash basis, Oshiomhole advises Edo exco
