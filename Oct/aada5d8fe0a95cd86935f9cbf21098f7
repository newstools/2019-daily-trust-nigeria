The All Progressives Congress, (APC)’s Deputy National Publicity Secretary, My Yekini Nabena, has joined traditional rulers in Bayelsa State in raising the alarm over weapons being stockpiled ahead of the November 16 governorship election. Nabena told journalists on Thursday in Abuja, that his home State was being transformed to a war zone ahead of the election. He said Governor Seriake Dickson, who had “clearly” seen that defeat was imminent for his candidate, had now resorted to deploying violence to force his will on the people.

We must take their reports very seriously. We have a duty to protect INEC and the voters to ensure free and safe elections,” he said. Nabena said the people of Bayelsa were ready to defend their votes and reject the Peoples Democratic Party’s candidate and Governor Dickson’s stooge.
