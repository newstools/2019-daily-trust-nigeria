Yusuf said Safiyya’s story was picked from 25 contestants shortlisted, adding that Safiyya, who is from Zaria in Kaduna State, is married with a daughter. “Maraici” is the story of Karima, a girl, who was abandoned as a baby, grew up in an orphanage and was adopted by Hajiya Babba, a benefactor that puts her through primary and secondary education. Karima was later married off to Alhaji Tukur, who at the end, divorced her, and she was rejected by Hajiya Babba. Safiyya told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that she was not sure when her phone woke her from sleep and she was told that she had won the competition.
