Speaker, House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila has said that the bulk of the work of getting more women to participate in politics and ensuring more of them can win electoral office, will happen within the political parties. Speaking in Abuja at the women in politics dialogue organised by women in management, business and public service, he enjoined women to join political parties of their choice and participate in the engagements of the activities of the party they chose. He urged women to ensure they register more females and organise them into caucuses hence through such they would be able to make demands, negotiate concessions and influence outcomes.

On her part, Kogi State governorship candidate for the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Natasha Akpoti said the major challenge women were not in political positions was the lack of unity among them. Akpoti said women’s population in the country was about 70 per cent, hence if they join forces to vote for a female candidate, victory was assured.
