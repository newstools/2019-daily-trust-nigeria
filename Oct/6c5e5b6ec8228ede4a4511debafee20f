Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bauchi State, Alhaji Uba Nana, has said that the party is still strong and formidable, despite losing the 2019 governorship election in the state. Nana, who stated this when he received the Minister of Science and Technology, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, at the party’s state secretariat during his official visit to Bauchi, said the party won all the three senatorial seats, nine out of the 12 House of Representatives seats and 21 out of 31 state assembly seats in the last polls. The chairman told the minister that the current speaker of the state house of assembly and majority leader of the house are all members of the APC, adding that the party is still strong and popular in the state. He also informed the minister that the party had filed an appeal at the Court of Appeal against the recent verdict delivered by the governorship election petitions tribunal in the state with a view of reclaiming APC’s stolen mandate.
