The roadshow for the 2019 Naija drivers and riders carnival has kicked off in Abuja. The roadshow is part of activities lined up to celebrate drivers and riders in the country tagged, the National Road Transport Merit Awards (NAROTMA). The event founder and national coordinator, Campbell Onyeaqanan, said drivers are uncommon people and deserved to be honoured for their contributions to national development. He said the event was to give drivers a space in history, “the event is carefully created to help promote and drive key government policies that will help stimulate change and reforms in the transport industry.” He said the carnival which started in 2016 had the sole purpose to give that honour to drivers and let the world know the importance of drivers and driving.
