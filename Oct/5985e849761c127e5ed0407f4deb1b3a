A middle-aged woman, Mrs Kemi Oyemeshin, told a customary court sitting in Ake, Abeokuta, that her husband, who had filed a petition to divorce her, had sex with her overnight before going to the court yesterday morning. Kemi made the statement to reinforce her denial of allegations of lack of love, adultery, submissiveness and fighting, which her husband, Folorunsho Oyemeshin, had levelled against her in his claims for divorce. She told the court that it was her husband’s jealousy that had him accuse her of adultery. According to her, the six-year relationship had always been riddled with distrust, suspicion and lack of freedom on Oyemeshin’s part.

I have always known the relationship will not last because of his actions. “When I discussed him with some of my friends, they said he was doing it out of love. But what he did the last time that made me give up was when he broke a bottle and attempted to stab me. “Your honour, we still live together,” Kemi said. She agreed that the court should separate them since her husband had filed for divorce. Mr Oyemeshin said he was fed up with the marriage that had not produced any child, besides Kemi’s alleged disrespect for him and frequent fighting. “She accused me of suspicion and distrust. Why won’t I do that when my wife is in the habit of saving male contacts with female names?” he said. The president of the court, Mrs A. O. Abimbola, adjourned the case till October 14, 2019 to give room for amicable settlement between the couple. Abimbola warned the husband against breaking a bottle or attempting to stab his wife, describing it as a criminal offence.
