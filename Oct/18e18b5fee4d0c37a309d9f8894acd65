The secretary of the media and publicity committee of the Kogi State APC campaign council, Dr Tom Ohikere, has called on the candidate of the PDP, Engr Musa Wada, not to set the state on fire through his actions and utterances. Dr Ohikere, in an interview with journalists yesterday in Abuja, said such behaviour would only earn him notoriety and infamy which is not good for popularity. The APC chieftain, who said Kogi State has enjoyed relative calm in recent times under the Governor Yahaya Bello’s war against insecurity, stated that the entry into the state by Wada for the official commencement of his campaign has ignited violence in the state.
