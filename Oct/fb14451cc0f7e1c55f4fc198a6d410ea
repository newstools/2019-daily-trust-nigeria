A National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) Community Development Service  (CDS) project, Educating Nigerians Girls in New Enterprises II (ENGINE II), has offered scholarships to 22 female students in public schools across the FCT. The Coordinator of ENGINE II, Mrs. Rita Alo, disclosed this at the 2019 CDS Biennial Seminar with the theme: “Exploiting the Potential of the Girl Child”, in Abuja. Mrs. Alo said the scholarship was introduced in 2017 to enhance girl child education by ensuring they remained in school, and that those that were out of school were brought back. She added that they had sponsored 144 girls for their secondary education and aimed to sponsor another 22. Mrs. Alo further said, “Education is the bedrock of development; the foundation on which creativity and innovation is built. “Girl child education not only increases the purchasing power of women and girls, it also develops their mental, social, political and physical attributes.” The FCT Coordinator of NYSC, Hajiya Walida Isa, represented by the Director, NYSC CDS, Mrs. Joy Haruna, advised the girls who were given the scholarships to ensure they did well like they did during the selection examination. Hajiya Walida appealed to more schools to open their doors to the programme for the benefit of children. She also encouraged the youth corps members to continue impacting the lives of the girl child and giving back to society. A corps member in the CDS group, Uche-Ewule Gift, said she felt fulfilled doing this for the girls and believed that a trend had been set for future achievements.
