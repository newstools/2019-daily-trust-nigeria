An Abeokuta-based Christian cleric, Dr Olayiwola Samson Mercy, has said that it is the turn of the Southwest to produce Nigeria’s president in 2023 despite the power struggle from other geopolitical zones. Olayiwola, however, told Yoruba leaders that it requires a fierce battle to achieve power shift, saying the North “is ready to cling to the power beyond 2023.” The clergyman, who is the general overseer of Christ Divine Churches International, spoke in Abeokuta, Ogun State, on Sunday during the church’s anniversary.

Olayiwola, while urging Nigerians to always remain peaceful and united, said “under President Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria has been moving forward. And I can testify.” The cleric said “in 2023, power will return to the Southwest because it’s Yorubas’ turn. Like you know, an average northerner wants to stay in power. And may I say this, in 2023, we have to force power out of the North because they are not ready to quit the stage for other zones. “But I want you to be rest assured that Nigeria will not break up. We will definitely have crisis but we will resolve it. Do you think a politician who just emerged as governor in Imo State would be part of moves for Nigeria’s break up?,” he said.
