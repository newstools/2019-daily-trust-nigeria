The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) on Wednesday called for calm over the closure of some car dealers’ offices in Kaduna and other neighbouring states. The Public Relations Officer of Customs, Mr Joseph Attah made the plea in Kaduna shortly after holding a sensitization meeting with Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) and other stakeholders in the state. Attah also urged the car dealers to be patients and not to take laws into their hands, saying the Customs decision on the operation might be beneficial to them in future. He said, “Many people must have read in the papers that Customs shutdown car dealers offices in Lagos, Kano and other states across the country. The operation was done by the Federal Operation Unit (FOU) of Customs.

Nobody should take laws into his hand. An official announcement will be made as soon as I get approval because the management of Customs will meet after the FOU submit their report to deliberate on the next line of action,” Attah said.
