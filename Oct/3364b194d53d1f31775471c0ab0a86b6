Chairman of the Abaji Area Council Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya says the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of the council is grossly inadequate, hence, those charged with the responsibility of improving its profile must put in more effort to improve it. Ajiya stated this while presiding over a meeting with members of the revenue committee of the council who submitted their report to the him yesterday at the council’s conference hall. He said the need to improve the revenue profile of the council has become necessary, adding that all relevant stakeholders of the council should support the committee to ensure they improve on its revenue generation capability.

The chairman said the council would soon put in place a taskforce to ensure that revenues are realized across sectors of the council. Also speaking, the council’s treasurer, Alhaji Salihu Ibn Muhammad, commended the council chairman for taking a step towards addressing the issue of revenue generation in the area. “I believe if proper measures are taken, that will aid the council in getting more funds to execute projects that will impact on the lives of residents,” he said.
