CLEEN Foundation has urged the National Assembly to pass legislations against vote buying as part of measures to ensure the success of the off-cycles and the 2023 general elections in the country. The chairman, board of directors of the foundation, Prof Etannibi Alemika, made the call on Wednesday in Abuja at the formal presentation of the 68-page “Report of the 2019 General Elections in Nigeria”.
