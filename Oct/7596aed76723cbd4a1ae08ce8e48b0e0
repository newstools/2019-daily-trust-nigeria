We all face fears. It’s part of what makes us human. It keeps us safe by avoiding danger, makes us prepared by prior planning. However, too much of it is detrimental. Fear can paralyze us, making what we are afraid of to come upon us. An entrepreneur faces many fears. We will look at the common ones, and how to deal with them. Fear of Change OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY Sales are the lifeblood of any business. Every entrepreneur is concerned about the impact of changes in the marketplace on their income. Many see technology as an enemy rather than a friend. The best way to overcome the fear of change is to embrace it and become part of it. We did not get here by remaining the same. The only constant thing in life is change. Fighting technology is an exercise in futility. Big companies understand this well. They invest in the development of new technologies. Major car makers now make electric models. They don’t wait until demand for petrol/diesel models starts to drop. You can only delay change for so long. You soon become part of the debris left behind by change. Keep up to date with trends in your industry. Become a player in the change movement. Embrace change early and make adjustments accordingly. That requires humility and remaining teachable. You need to develop a mindset that embraces change. It comes from constant learning. What you know may have taken you as far as it can. As technology evolves, you need to relearn. Thinking you know everything you need to know is setting yourself up for a fall.
