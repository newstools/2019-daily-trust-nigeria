President of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Engineer Mansur Ahmed, has urged members to familiarise themselves and their management with the on-going processes leading to the commencement of trading under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) in 2020. Speaking at the 22nd Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the association in Kaduna at the weekend, the president assured that the association is engaging the Federal Government to ensure that all impediments that constraint manufacturers from participation in AfCFTA are addressed and the sector is enabled to avail all the opportunities. While noting that insecurity in the country is a major threat to the nation’s economy and manufacturing industries, especially in Kaduna State, he enjoined members to be prepared to compete with other African producers, particularly, South Africa, Egypt and Morocco, countries that have manufacturing capacities in Nigeria’s league.

This sector which used to employ over 20,000 Kaduna indigenes in the 70s and 80s is now virtually extinct and bringing it back to life should be a priority for Kaduna State.”  Nobel Peace Prize winner demands action against sexual violence Why Buhari put AU trade deal on hold 44 countries sign Africa’s trade pact
