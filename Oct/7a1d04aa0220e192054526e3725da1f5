Plateau State gubernatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the last election, Senator Jeremiah T. Useni, has said that his battle with Governor Simon Lalong is not over. The state governorship election petition tribunal had on October 2, 2019 upheld the victory of Lalong at the March governorship election. Hosting members of the PDP at national and Plateau State House of Assembly, Useni said he would pursue his case to its logical conclusion.

And we thought that the tribunal would be happy that the Supreme Court upheld their position. But the tribunal ignored the Supreme Court’s position and stuck to that of the Court of Appeal, saying that they never heard about the judgement of the Supreme Court. “We also wondered what was the hurry in delivering a judgement immediately, just one day after the Independence holiday? Something was amiss. But these things are just a test. I will pass my test. I will not fail this test. Within two weeks, we will file the appeal. And we will go even up to the Supreme Court. “The war is not over yet. No soldier loses one battle and runs away. Our joy is only being delayed. It will not be denied,” he said. In his remarks, leader of the delegation, Sen Istifanus Gyang (PDP, Plateau North), described the tribunal judgement as a rude shock.
