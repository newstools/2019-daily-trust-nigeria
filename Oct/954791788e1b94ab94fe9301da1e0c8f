FCT Minister of State Dr Ramatu Aliyu says the administration will overhaul Gwagwalada Women Food Processing Centre to enhance economic growth among rural women. Dr Aliyu made this known at the end of a tour of facilities in Gwagwalada Area Council, according to a statement by her Special Assistant on Media, Austine Elemue. She said the FCT Administration would collaborate with the private sector to make the centre viable.

Interestingly, and sadly too, they are brand new machines but not put to use. Basically, this is a case of abandoned project. “I don’t know what it is intended for, but we are going to revisit it completely and revive the Food Processing Unit of the centre to produce groundnut oil, garri, rice, even bread enough to supply FCT in totality. “This will also go by way of public private partnership arrangement. “We are going to advertise in the newspapers to find experts to operate the machines and from there get the building restructured. “As you can see, the structures are weak because they have been there for decades. So we will try to see how we can upgrade and strengthen the facilities. “Then with this, we will be able to empower the women,” She said.  ‘Agric processing neglected  in  FCT’ With adequate support we can compete with mega rice mills Rice processing business brings succor to rural women in Kano
