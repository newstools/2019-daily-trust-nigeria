The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) yesterday said its operatives removed four vehicles from Fraser Suites in Abuja based on intelligence that vehicles without Duty Payment were taken there from a car dealer’s stand. Recall that Customs this week began a nationwide raid on car dealer shops to seize vehicles that have no import duty on them. A statement by the Public Relations Officer (PRO), Deputy Comptroller Joseph Attah clarified what it described as misinformation about the operation. It said: “Our operatives, relying on intelligence that owners of some exotic cars (including bullet proof) without duty payment quickly removed their vehicles from a car mart and took same to Fraser Hotel, Abuja. OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY “On arrival at the hotel, our operatives interacted with the manager and eventually left with four vehicles leaving six behind, while expecting the manager to provide the keys to the cars left behind. “However, the manager this morning gave a written undertaking to produce Customs vehicle duty payment document to support his claim that the vehicles were not smuggled,” it noted. NCS said the Service assured the manager of prompt release of the seized vehicles as soon as evidence of appropriate duty payments are presented. Attah, in the statement further clarified that the operation had nothing to do with guests at the hotel and did not wake the guests up to identify the vehicles.
