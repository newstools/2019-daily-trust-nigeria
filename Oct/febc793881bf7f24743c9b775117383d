A former Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu (PDP, Enugu), has raised the issue of xenophobic attacks at the October session of the International Parliament for Tolerance and Peace (IPTP) holding in Ethiopia. Speaking yesterday at the opening plenary of the parliament in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, Ekweremadu, who chairs the Legal and Legislative Affairs Committee of the IPTP, urged the parliament to pay special attention to the problem of xenophobic attacks on the African continent. “Since we are holding this session in Africa, permit me to mention the issue of xenophobia, a development that worries me. There is a growing trend in acts and incidences of intolerance, which is destroying the brotherhood, peace and mutual relationship among the people of Africa. As a special parliament focusing on tolerance and peace, we will not close our eyes to the cases of xenophobia wherever they exist. “I also appeal to our brothers and sisters in Africa to not only continue to tolerate, but to also respectfully accept one another as one people with a common destiny,” he was quoted in a statement by his media aide, Uche Anichukwu.
