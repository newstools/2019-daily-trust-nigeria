“Economists advise Nigeria to increase its export in order to truly reduce poverty. Good news, from export of N8.53 trillion in 2016, Nigeria has done magic to boost export to N19.9trn in 2018. And as export surpassed imports by N5.93trn, Nigeria is creating a good Chinese-model economy.” The claim above was made by a Twitter user, Omasoro Ali Ovie on Monday on his handle, @OvieAli, and it generated many likes and retweets. Ovie wrote that his tweets were “mostly about progress Nigeria to inspire others.” OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY President Muhammadu Buhari’s Personal Assistant on New Media, Bashir Ahmad, retweeted the claim with the comment, “stronger you my brother” while the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Social Media, Lauretta Onochie, liked the tweet.  Verification The Daily Trust consulted the foreign trade data published by the country’s apex statistical body, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), to verify the claim. NBS data showed that in 2016, Nigeria’s export value stood at N8.53trn while import value stood at N8.82trn. In 2017, the country’s export value rose to N13.60trn while import value also increased to N9.56trn. The data showed that in 2018, export value hit N18.53trn while import value stood at N13.17 trillion. Nigeria’s trade balance, being export minus import, grew from N290 billion in 2016 to N4.04trn in 2017 and N5.36trn in 2018.  Verdict While the claim that Nigeria’s export value in 2016 was N8.53trn is true, the claim that it jumped to N19.9trn in 2018 is false. According to NBS data, the export value in 2018 was N18.53trn, being N1.37trn below Ovie’s claim. The claim that Nigeria’s trade balance was N5.93trn in 2018 is also false as data showed that the value was N5.36trn, being N570bn below the claimed value.
