Lagos State House of Assembly has suspended the probe of former Governor Akinwunmi Ambode in deference to a high court ruling urging the parties to maintain the status quo. Ambode had on Tuesday approached the state high court sitting in Ikeja to challenge the legality of the probe of his administration over the purchase of 820 buses and other transactions carried out by his administration. The house, through its ad hoc committee, had summoned the former governor to appear before its committee over the purchase of 820 buses without the approval of the house. Ambode did not honour the invitation twice even as the house threatened to issue a warrant of arrest against him. But on Wednesday, the court ordered the assembly to stay action on the probe pending the determination of the case which has been adjourned till November 20. Speaking on the matter, the ad hoc committee chairman, Hon. Fatai Mojeed, said the probe was adjourned indefinitely following a court summon to stay action. According to him, as a law-abiding institution, the house had to respect the order of court. “We are lawmakers; we are not law breakers, which was why we had to adjourn the matter indefinitely. The people of Lagos should be expecting more from us,” he said.
