The natives of the FCT under the umbrella of Coalition of Abuja Indigenous Association (COAIA) has condemned the federal government’s move to appeal the recent court ruling which affirmed that the indigenous people of the territory should also be appointed as minister. Addressing a press conference in Abuja yesterday, the Assistant Coordinator of the coalition, Comrade Ezekiel Dalhatu, said the move by the federal government was an act against the original inhabitants of the FCT, while urging Nigerians and the international community to intervene. “The federal government is seeking the leave of the court of appeal to appeal in the Supreme Court against the court’s appeal judgment ordering President Muhammadu Buhari to at least appoint a native of FCT after almost two years of the judgment,” he said. He also said the natives have in the last 40 years been suffering government’s neglect and intimidation ranging from forceful eviction of the natives from their ancestral homes with no replacement or compensation.
