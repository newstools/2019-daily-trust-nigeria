The Governing Council of the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria has approved for call of application from qualified candidates to fill the post of the University’s Vice Chancellor that would become vacant from April 2020. The council’s “resolution”, our correspondent gathered from impeccable source, urged the ABU management to advertise the position of the VC tomorrow, Thursday, October 3, 2019, for interested candidates from within and outside the university to apply. As one of the largest universities in Sub-Saharan Africa, ABU has eminent professors with required credentials and pedigrees to occupy the position of the VC.

The most mentioned names are that of Professor Kabiru Bala of Building Department, who was the immediate past Deputy Vice Chancellor (DVC), Administration, of the University. He is seen by many as a likely competent contestant. Others are Professor Sadiq Zubairu Abubakar, who was the immediate past director of the National Agricultural Extension Research Liaison Services (NAERLS) and the incumbent DVC (Administration), as well as Professor Zakari Mohammed, who was one time Librarian of the university. There are others like Professor Hudu Abdullahi of the Political Science and International Studies Department and Professor Bakari Adamu Girei, former Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, among many others, our reporter learnt.
