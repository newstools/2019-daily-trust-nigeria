No fewer than 103 people have been empowered by the Society for the Youths and Downtrodden (SOYD). The group’s acting president, Jerry Ogbu, who made this known while addressing journalists said they wanted to use empowerment as a means of defeating poverty. He said residents needed to be given sustainable ways to fend for themselves, adding that government should ensure that more gets to the downtrodden in the territory.

He said the group has formed a 100-man committee on the interest of the nation to devise innovative ways of reaching out to the poor and downtrodden in the FCT and other states. “It is of interest to see how the country will move forward. We don’t want Nigeria to be called the headquarters of poverty in the world,” he said. Ogbu said the members of the committee comprise youths in various professions whom he described as a think-tank that would deliberate on ensuring social justice for residents.
