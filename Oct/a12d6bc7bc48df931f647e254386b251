A member representing Brass/Nembe federal constituency, Mr Israel Sunny-Goli, has said the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate, Chief David Lyon, is the only alternative to save Bayelsans from poverty and hardship perpetrated by the PDP-led government in the state. Goli, while speaking with newsmen yesterday in Yenagoa, said the recent statement by Governor Seriake Dickson claiming that the APC governorship candidate is being supported by an oil company was far from the truth. “How can a governor say that our own governorship candidate that has clean records is a terrorist? Is it because he was a contractor in Agip or his company was given a contract by the oil firm, what about PDP members who are also doing contracts with Agip.

In short, he is the demand of the people. Today, anywhere he passes in this state, people embrace him with both hands even without soliciting for their support,” he said.
