More than 150 women have been offered free healthcare services in Jiwa, an Abuja community. The free healthcare service was offered by Kinetic Inclusive Health Initiative under its Safe Motherhood Project in which women are given free antenatal and postnatal treatments. Fifty seven babies have been delivered since the beginning of the project in January 2019. One of the beneficiaries, Mojisola Olojede, was delivered of a baby boy through caesarean section, “till the day of my delivery, they did not ask for any money, the antennal was free, the CS was free, even the medicine was free, they did not collect a kobo,” she said. OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY The Founder, Kinetic Inclusive Health Initiative, Dr. Adewunmi Ayodele, said the rising mortality rate in Nigeria is traceable to poor antenatal care which in turn is traceable to poverty hence they set up the initiative to save lives at no cost. He said it was discovered that most women in the community patronised traditional birth attendants, adding that the women were only brought to the hospital after the resulting complications from child birth. “We now noticed that referring them was also a problem. Once you do that, they don’t go anywhere and the next day, they will tell you that the person died. It is such a sad thing, so we now decided that if finance is the problem, we should remove it  and attend to their health need,” he said. He said the Kinetic Inclusive Health Initiative is the charity arm of the Kinetic Hospital, “What we have been able to do is to plow back our profit into the venture and we try to motivate our staff to give their best,” he added. He said the initiative plans to reach 10,000 women in Nigeria, after the completion of the pilot phase in Jiwa.
