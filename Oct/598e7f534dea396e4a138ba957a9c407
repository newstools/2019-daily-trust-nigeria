Wife of Kogi State governor, Mrs. Rashida Yahaya Bello, has called on women in the state to support the re-election bid of her husband in the November 16 governorship election in the state. She made the call in Koton Karfe, headquarters of Kogi Local Government Area of the state at the official flag off of the Kogi West Women rally of APC ahead of the election. She assured that her husband would continue to initiate policies and programmes geared towards women empowerment. The governor’s wife added that her husband had given opportunity for more women to occupy key positions in his government, citing the examples of the SSG, education commissioner and others. “If my husband is re-elected, he will continue to execute programmes that would impact positively on the lives of women and children. My husband’s administration has performed wonderfully not only for women and youth but the entire state through policies on infrastructure, security and youth emancipation,” she said.  2019: Aisha Buhari launches women, youth campaign for Buhari 2,000 women, youth in Kogi to be engaged in rice farming 2015 elections: Patience Jonathan on the rampage
