He called for synergy between him as the PDP leader and the Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva, the APC leader to achieve free, fair, and peaceful governorship election in the state. “In Bayelsa state, PDP is the largest, biggest and the most formidable political platform. Compared to the other side which didn’t have the luxury of having a credible primary, a candidate was brought out from the pocket of the leader of the party; a candidate that is not sellable; a candidate that we all know can’t govern, so for us the election is already won. Won by us and lost on the other side,” he said.
