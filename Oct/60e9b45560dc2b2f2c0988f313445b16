The All Blending Party (ABP) has protested to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) against the exclusion of its governorship candidate, Motunrayo Bamaiyi, fielded for the November 16 election in Kogi State. Director General of the campaign organisation of the party, Ugbede Iduh, who led other party members on a peaceful protest to INEC’s headquarters in Lokoja at the weekend, said they were surprised that the commission excluded the name of their candidate from the final list released. He said they had tried to get explanations from the national leadership of the party as to why their candidate was not listed but could not get any cogent response, hence the peaceful protest to INEC.

He explained that the party’s nomination was invalid on the ground that the governorship candidate submitted to INEC was 33-years-old as against 35 years stipulated by the constitution.
