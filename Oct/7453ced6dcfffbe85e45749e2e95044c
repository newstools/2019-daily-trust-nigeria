The Social Democratic Party (SDP) has dragged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to court over the disqualification of its governorship candidate in Kogi State, Natasha Hadiza Akpoti, for presenting an underage as her running mate. National chairman of the party Prof. Tunde Adeniran, who addressed journalists yesterday in Abuja, enjoined Kogi electorate and the supporters of Barrister Akpoti to keep faith as the party would get justice. He described her disqualification as not only a sad development but a great disservice to democracy and an infringement on the rights of Nigerian citizens of Kogi extraction.
