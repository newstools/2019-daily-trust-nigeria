The Minority leader of the House of Representatives, Ndudi Elumelu (PDP, Delta) has advised the Nigerian Army against its planned nationwide implementation of Operation Positive Identification (OPI). Elumelu, in a statement on Monday, expressed concern over the planned operation, describing it as a ploy for the militarilization of Nigeria. The House Minority leader maintained that the plan operation infringes on the fundamental rights of Nigerians, as enshrined in the 1999 constitution (as amended) and would downgrade innocent Nigerians to suspects and conquered people in their own country. He said it will also strip Nigerians of their constitutionally guaranteed freedom of movement and instill fear, anxiety and panic in the entire polity, adding that the nationwide operation would amount to an indirect imposition of a state of emergency across the country by the Army. The Minority leader expressed concerns that, since the military operation involves direct contact and regulating of civiliansâ€™ movement, it could result in abuses and serious safety issues, especially at this time the nation is battling with the scourge of victimization and extra-judicial killings. Elumelu pointed out that many Nigerians, particularly those living in the rural areas, would be victimized, as there had not been enough public sensitization for such security operation.
