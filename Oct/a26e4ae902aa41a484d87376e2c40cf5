The Nigerian industry and other sectors lose about N30 billion annually to prevalence of accidents, Chairman, Lagos State Branch of the Institute of Safety Professionals of Nigeria (ISPN), Engr. Timothy Iwuagwu has said. Speaking at the fifth edition of the award in Lagos recently, Iwuagwu said, “In terms of naira and kobo, we are losing N30 billions if not trillions to safety challenges annually especially looking at the gross negligence among operating firms across the country “ He explained that safety in the country was still evolving, despite peculiar challenges as a developing nation, and arguably still in the formative stage. OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY Iwuagwu noted that the reason for this was because there is no current national legislation that mandates stakeholders and regulators on safety adherence, saying with the absence of strict regulations, health and safety are approached and seen as actions relegated to use of common-sense practice by most employers and businesses. Promoters of the Nigeria safety awards for excellence hall of fame (9jasafe) said the absence of strict regulations is making employers to adopt only common sense practice to ensure health and safety. The Lagos chairman of the safety institute bemoaned the sorry state of safety regulation in the country, saying that failure of will power had relegated the safety sector to the background despite the laws being there.
