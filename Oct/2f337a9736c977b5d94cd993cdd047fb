Mr Alfred Mapak, a herbal medicine practitioner, has urged Nigerians to patronise herbal products because of ‘their tested efficacy.’ Mapak gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Abuja. He said herbs have been proven to be beneficial and safe for human consumption, noting that some of the herbs are used to produce orthodox medicines.

Mapak said herbs have numerous natural components which have powerful medicinal properties that can fight many diseases even better than conventional drugs. According to him, the herbs are also accessible and cheap. “Nature has given us remedies that we can use and subdue illness in the body and it is good we explore it,” said the herbalist. He accused the pharmaceutical industry of discouraging people from using herbs when they are supposed to be complementary. Mapak explained that herbs are foods we consume; ‘but it just has to do with the way it is prepared.’ The herbal practitioner said garlic and ginger, among others, are remedies and they have powerful medicinal properties. He added that herbal medicines have many health benefits with low side effects, compared to conventional drugs. Mapak said nature has cure for all diseases and conditions. However, he advised patients to consult practitioners on the right herbs to take, instead of self prescription to avoid complications.
