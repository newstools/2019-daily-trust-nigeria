Kano State Governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, has said that Nigeria’s democracy needs a committed legislative arm in order for it to be vigorous and exuberant. Ganduje said democracy in Nigeria attained its present stage courtesy of the diligent participation and commitment by the legislatures at the local, state and federal levels. The governor made the remarks while declaring open the 2019 retreat for members and management staff of the 9th Kano State House of Assembly organised in Kaduna. OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY Ganduje, who was represented by the Deputy Governor, Nasiru Yusuf Gawuna, noted that the nation’s democracy had been grappling with various challenges ranging from constitutional crises to inter and intra party wrangling. “Despite these enormous challenges, our democratic settings are blossoming gradually and this will not be unconnected with the robust and diligent participation and strict observation of stipulated functions of our legislative members,” he stated. In his remarks, Speaker of Kano State House of Assembly, Abdul’Aziz Garba Gafasa, explained that the 2019 retreat titled ‘The Role of Legislature in the Evolution of Democracy in Nigeria’ was intended to, among other things, build members’ capacity to begin to rely less on the executive for the initiation of bills.
