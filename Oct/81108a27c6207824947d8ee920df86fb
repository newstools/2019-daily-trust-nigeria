The Registrar and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Council for the Regulation of Freight Forwarding in Nigeria (CRFFN), Sam Nwakohu, has said freight forwarders who refused to register with the council on or before December, 2019, will not get their licences renewed by the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS). Towards this end, he advised all freight forwarders in the country to take advantage of the window of opportunity provided to register or risk being shut out at the expiration of the deadline. Similarly, the benchmark for freight forwarding practice in Nigeria from 2021 will be the FIATA Diploma in Freight Forwarding and Supply Chain Management which will “be raised (as prescribed by the Act) to FIATA Higher Diploma in the nearest future.” Both plans have already been endorsed by the Federal Government, with the Minister of Transportation, Mr. Chibuike Amaechi, declaring at a sensitisation workshop on Tuesday in Lagos on “Freight Forwarding as a Career” that, “Not even the president is above the law.” He explained that, “We will get the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) and all other agencies not to allow those persons (not yet conforming) to function. They can only function through the law guiding CRFFN.”  CRFFN to offer PhD, master’s degree in Freight Forwarding Proliferation of clearing agents worries Shippers Council We displaced Lebanese, Indians in import business – Freight forwarder
