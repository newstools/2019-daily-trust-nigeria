Plateau State PDP gubernatorial candidate in the 2019 election, Senator Jeremiah Useni, has approached the Court of Appeal to challenge the judgement of the governorship election petition tribunal which upheld the victory of Governor Simon Lalong. This was revealed by the media consultant to Useni, Yiljap Abraham, in a statement made available to newsmen in Jos, the state capital. It said Useni’s legal team, led by Mike Ozekhome (SAN) and Edward Pwajok (SAN) had filed the notice of appeal.

Instead, the learned tribunal clearly somersaulted in arriving at its decision which was at odds with its findings and this occasioned a miscarriage of justice. That is why we are appealing the judgement,” he said.
