The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has asked the National Assembly to invoke its statutory powers and directly channel the N10.069 billion Presidential Funds for payment of salaries and pensions of “suffering” Kogi state workers. The PDP in a statement yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan said it was scandalous that President Muhammadu Buhari would seek to mislead the National Assembly by asserting that the fund was for projects done by the state government on behalf of the federal government. The party argued that in reality no one can point to any such project executed by Governor Yahaya Bello in the last four years in the state.
