The Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mohammed Adamu, has approved the establishment of five new divisions in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) command of the Nigeria Police. The new police divisions are Pegi Division, Kuje area council, Biaji Division, AMAC, Dawaki Division, Bwari area council, Yebu Division, Kwali area council and Galadima Division, AMAC. A statement by the FCT Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Mariam Yusuf, said the creation of these divisions was in line with the IGP concept of community policing which, he said was intended to bring the police closer to the community and jointly combat criminality in all ramifications. She said the creation of the new divisions was necessitated by population explosion, vast terrain and infrastructural availability in the affected areas. “The Command enjoins the public to cooperate with the operatives of these new divisions for effective and efficient policing. “The Command wishes to reassure the public of its unwavering commitment to tackle crime and ensure safety in the FCT. In case of emergency contact the Command through any of these emergency numbers: 08032003913, 08061581938, 07057337653,” he added.
