A 72-year-old traditional ruler in Osun State, the Olokinnini of Okinni, Oba Kadiri Okanola, was on Friday arraigned before a magistrate court in Osogbo for allegedly threatening the life of one of his subjects, Alhaji Morenikeji Sikiru. The police prosecutor, Lamidi Razaq, told the court that Oba Okanola threatened Sikiru’s life in a manner that could cause a breach of the peace in the society. The traditional ruler pleaded not guilty to the offence and his counsel, Abdulfatai Abdulsalam, urged the court to grant him bail because of his status as a traditional ruler.
