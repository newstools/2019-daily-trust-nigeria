The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC’s) directive to telecommunication companies is to ensure they store and make available, recordings of communications carried out over their network is in line with the provisions of the Nigerian Data Protection Regulation (NDPR), the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) has said. NITDA’s Director General Mr Inuwa Kashifu, who disclosed this in a statement yesterday in Abuja while reacting to a publication on ‘New NCC Directive will push telecoms to violate the NDPR’, said the regulation is to ensure that  government provides adequate information to relevant regulators and make them aware of the benefits accrued for national security. Kashifu said “The right to privacy, which the NDPR seeks to protect, is established by Section 37 of the 1999 Constitution as amended. OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY “It emphasises that in a democratic society, there is right to privacy protection subject to justifiable law for public safety and order. “The provisions of the NDPR are in agreement with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which focuses on prevention of threats to public security. “NDPR provides multiple bases for processing of personal data, while all data processing must be founded on legitimate interest, consent of data subject, legal interest, and contract of parties, public interest and vital interest of the data subject. “The NCC’s directive is predicated on legitimacy and public interest,” he said. He also said that NCC among other relevant stakeholders was working hard to implement the NDPR directive.
