The immediate past Governor of Bauchi State, Muhammed Abubakar, has vowed to sue the state government against corruption charges in the reports of the state government’s Assets and Funds Recovery Committee. A statement signed the press secretary to the former governor, Ali M. Ali yesterday in Bauchi said, the former governor will take legal action against what he described as desperate haste in the distortion and misrepresentation of records and facts. He said “these will not go legally unchallenged.” Bauchi State Funds and Asset Recovery Committee had last Wednesday during a press conference alleged that former governor Abubakar has mismanaged state funds and violations of his oath of office during his tenure as governor of the state.
