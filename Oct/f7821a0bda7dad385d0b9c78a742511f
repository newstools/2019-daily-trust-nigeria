A former governor of Imo State, Owelle Rochas Okorocha, has asked his successor, Emeka Ihedioha, to account for N5.2 billion he (Okorocha) claims he left in the kitty of the state for the payment of pensions. Okorocha, in a statement signed by his Media Adviser, Sam Onwuemeodo, said he was at the verge of paying pensioners in the state before he was stopped by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Okorocha decried the blame game by his successor for his inability to fix dilapidated roads and other infrastructures, saying that instead of attacking him for failing to deliver on its campaign promises, the PDP-led government has not only continued to stagger, but resorted to excessive nagging since its inauguration on May 29, 2019.
