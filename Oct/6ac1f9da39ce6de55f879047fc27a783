Speaking at a rally to mark World Mental Health Day, the Medical Director of the Hospital, Professor Abdulkareem Jika Yusuf stated that in line with this year’s theme “Suicide prevention”, the Hospital was prepared to tackle mentally related suicide cases.

He said the government over the years paid only lip services to mental illness stressing that with just 120-bed space the hospital cannot handle mental cases. Yusuf, however, expressed hope and satisfaction in the leadership style of President Muhammadu Buhari stressing that with increased budgetary provisions the hospital can effectively man its catchment area.
