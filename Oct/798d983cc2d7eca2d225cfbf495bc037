The police in Abuja on Monday arraigned a bus driver’s assistant, Chukwuemeka Christopher, who allegedly stole two tyres from his employer’s truck in a Karmo Grade I Area Court. Christopher, who works for Chisco Transport Company Abuja, is charged with two counts of conspiracy and theft. He, however, pleaded not guilty. The prosecutor,  Mrs Ijeoma Ukagha, said that the matter was reported at the Utako police station on Oct. 17, by one Bako, who works in the same company. Ukagha alleged that Christopher was working on the company’s truck travelling to Lagos to deliver some goods. She added that on the way, the vehicle developed a mechanical fault and Christopher offered to look after the vehicle and the goods while the driver goes to fetch help. The prosecutor said that before the driver returned with a mechanic, the defendant removed two tyres from the truck. Ukagha explained that during police investigation, the defendant could not give a satisfactory account of the missing tyres. She noted that the offence contravened Section 288 of the Penal Code. The Judge, Alhaji Inuwa Maiwada, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N100, 000 with one surety in like sum. Maiwada, ordered that the surety must reside within the court jurisdiction. He adjourned the case until Nov 30, for substantive hearing.
