Minority Leader of the House of Representatives Hon. Ndudi Elumelu has called for thorough legislative scrutiny of the N10.33 trillion 2020 fiscal estimates as presented to the National Assembly by President Muhammadu Buhari. The leader of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)-led opposition in the House also picked holes in the 2020 budget, insisting that the envisaged budget will be subjected to critical evaluation to ensure that it reflects the general aspiration of Nigerians. In a statement signed personally by him and made available to Daily Trust in Asaba, Elumelu maintained that though the House had resolved to pass the budget before the end of the year, the details, particularly the capital expenditure items and implementation modules must meet the yearning of Nigerians before the budget is passed into law. The minority leader noted that the opposition “recognises the fact that Nigerians look up to them to protect their interest in critical issues that directly affect their lives, particularly on budget planning and implementation in key sectors.” “Consequently, the opposition assures that the details of the N2.46 trillion capital budget must be dissected and adjusted accordingly to ensure that critical needs of Nigerians are adequately accommodated, as well as to plug waste and eliminate budgetary corruption at every stage,” the statement read in part.
