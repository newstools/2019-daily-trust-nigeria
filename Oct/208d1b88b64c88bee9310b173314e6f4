The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and the Jama’atu Nasril Islam (JNI) have called on political actors and the electorate in Kogi State to shun all forms of violence and work for peaceful election on November 16. Leaders of the two religious bodies made the call in Lokoja yesterday at a one-day workshop themed ‘The Fear of God as a Panacea for Peaceful and Transparent Election’. Chairman of CAN in Kogi Bishop John Ibenu, in his address, said politicians and all stakeholders in the electoral process must imbibe the fear of God as that remained the only avenue to actualise the much needed peaceful election in the state. On his part, the State Chairman of JNI, Amb. Usman Bello, said Islam and Christianity both preach peace, and therefore urged politicians and the electorate who mostly belong to either of the two faiths to imbibe peace before, during and after the election. He also urged officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to be transparent and fair in all their dealings during the forthcoming election.
