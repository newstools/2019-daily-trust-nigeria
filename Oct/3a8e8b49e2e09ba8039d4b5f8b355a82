The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), Abeokuta field office, Ogun State, has challenged the Independent Petroleum Marketers (IPMAN) and other stakeholders to channel their investments towards increasing Compressed National Gas (CNG) outlets. The DPR Controller of Operations, Mrs. Muinat Bello-Zagi made this known while speaking with journalists shortly after a meeting with the Cooking Gas Skid Proprietors Association of Nigeria (CGSPAN), Ogun State chapter. Mrs Bello-Zagi expressed concern that as at today, there is only one CNG filling station in Ogun State, which according to her, “is not sufficient.” OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY She told IPMAN members that instead of building more filling stations, they should invest in more CNG filling stations, saying it’s cheaper, safer, available and it would curb importation. Mrs Bello – Zagi said “We are calling on all our stakeholders to please invest in CNG as well as LPG and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). “From what we have heard from the people that have already invested in it and are using it, even most of the commuter buses that ply Lagos and Ibadan, is that it is cheaper. It is 50 percent cheaper than using petrol,” she noted.
