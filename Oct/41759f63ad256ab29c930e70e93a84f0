The Campaign Council of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the November governorship election in Kogi State has said its candidate and incumbent Governor Yahaya Bello cannot be defeated by any of the candidates in the forthcoming election. The spokesman of the campaign council, Kingsley Fanwo, in a statement issued yesterday in Lokoja said the array of personalities in the party’s campaign council and “the swell of supporters across the state” were clear indications that “it is only Governor Bello that can defeat himself in the November 16 governorship election.” “From East to the Central and West, the groundswell of support across the state has demoralized the opposition PDP ahead of the election. The state has never been this united behind a governorship candidate.

James Abiodun Faleke and aspirants who contested with the governor has shown that APC will win the coming governorship election massively,” he said.
