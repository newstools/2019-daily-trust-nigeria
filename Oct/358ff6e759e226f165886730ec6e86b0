A 37-year-old teacher, Rachael Nkechi Chima, has asked the Igando, Lagos, customary court to dissolve her marriage to her husband, Francis Chima, for alleged lack of care and frequent fighting. Rachael, a resident of No. 12, Friday Owoade Street, Abaranje-Ikotun, Lagos, told the court that she bore a pregnancy that belonged to Chima for two and a half years and her husband didn’t express any sympathy towards her condition. She said she was compelled to pack out of their matrimonial home to her parent’s house, already pregnant, when the quarrelling between them became too much and Chima didn’t bother to visit her to check her condition. “If I try to make things right in the home, his mother would always shift the blame on me. On December 31, 2016, he requested for divorce, saying he no longer had any emotional attachment to me. “I left his home two years ago and he didn’t care. When my dad and I went to his house, he insulted us. I don’t love him anymore. Seeing him reminds me of all the pains I felt in his home, and because of the Insults on my father, I want the court to dissolve our marriage so that I can move on with my life,” the petitioner said. Chima, who appeared in court yesterday, also said he was no longer interested in the marriage. The court president, Barrister Koledoye Festus Adeniyi, consequently dissolved the marriage.
