The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has challenged Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello to “stop wasting public funds on campaign” and get prepared to accept defeat in the November 16 governorship election in the state. The party, in a statement yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, claimed that it already had the support of over 70 percent of registered voters in 18 out of the 21 local government areas of the state. “Since we kicked off our grassroots campaigns in the last few weeks, the PDP has continued to receive overwhelming support, solidarity and endorsements from all segments of the voting population, including political leaders and community groups, workers, pensioners, students, youth groups, business groups, professionals, and a host of other Kogites who have become despondent with the excruciating misrule of Yahaya Bello.

Governor Bello and the APC ought to have known that it is all over for them. “The spontaneous public jubilation that greeted the retrieval of PDP’s mandate of Barr. Shaba Ibrahim, for Lokoja/Kogi Federal Constituency, at the Court of Appeal, despite the machinations of the APC, reinforces the imminent triumph of the PDP and the people in the November 16 governorship election,” the PDP said.
