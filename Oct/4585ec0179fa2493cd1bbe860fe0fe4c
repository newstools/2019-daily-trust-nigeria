The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said that 87 out of 159 observer groups that participated in this year’s general elections are yet to submit their reports, eight months after the poll was conducted. INEC Chairman Prof. Mahmood Yakubu said this on Wednesday in Abuja at the commission’s quarterly consultative meeting with Civil Society Organisations (CSOs). He decried the inability of registered CSOs to summit their election observation reports. Prof. Yakubu said only 72 CSOs submitted their 2019 election observation reports out of over 159 groups accredited. “For the 2019 general elections, the commission accredited a total of 159 observer groups out of which 120 were domestic and 39 foreign. Collectively, they proposed to deploy 73,562 observers: 71,256 domestic and 2,306 foreign. “However, seven months after the general elections, the commission has so far received reports from only 72 observer groups out of 159, representing 45.2 percent. “I wish to remind those that are yet to formally submit their reports to the commission to do so in earnest in both hard and soft copies as required of them under their terms of accreditation,” he said. Speaking on behalf of the CSOs, the Executive Director, Inclusive Friends Association (IFA), Mrs Grace Jerry, assured INEC of the organizations’ continued support towards improving the conduct of elections in Nigeria.
