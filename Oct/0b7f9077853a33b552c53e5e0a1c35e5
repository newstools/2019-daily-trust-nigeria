The National Commercial Tricycle and Motorcycle Owners and Riders Association (NACTOMORAS) has sensitised over 1,000 tricycle operators in Garki. The operators were enlightened on the dangers of drug abuse, underage driving and other issues during a seminar on Tuesday. The group said the seminar would be taken to operators in Galadimawa and Nyanya, adding that the association has partnered a security firm on an electronic security solution application that is used to monitor the activities of its members.

The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Ayuba Gora Wobin in his address at the seminar said tricycle operators ‘now obey traffic lights to an extent.’ He said efforts of the corps and NACTOMORAS was paying off. “Before, none of these tricycle operators obeyed traffic light, but today, they obey traffic light to an extent. Where I have issues with them now is the few seconds before the traffic light gives a green light. Most of them having waited for almost two minutes, will not wait to see the green light before they proceed. “That is the area I’m battling with them around Gwarimpa/Jabi Axis now. Honestly, they are catching up, but we will not relent,” Wobin said.  ‘Reckless’ tricycle operators flood Abuja Tricycle operators launch e-public security app Thrills, frills, hard talks as tricycles cruise Abuja
