The governorship campaign council of the PDP in Kogi State has said the recent endorsement of the second term bid of Governor Yahaya Bello by Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) will not save him from defeat in the November 16 election. In a statement signed by the vice chairman, Public Communications Directorate of the campaign organisation, Austin Usman Okai, the opposition party said endorsements by ‘foreigners’ are not enough to save Bello from the resolute determination of the Kogi electorate to vote him out on November 16. Okai assured Kogi electorate that the incoming PDP government of Engr. Musa Wada has worked out defined strategies which will confer on them as well as visitors and investors all necessary aid and privileges that will support them in their individual growth and business aspirations.
