The Chairman of Gwagwalada Area Council, Alhaji Mustapha Adamu Danze, said the council has commenced the naming of streets and house numbering. Danze, who spoke with newsmen recently in Gwagwalada, said the exercise was part of security measures to combat crime, adding that when streets are named and houses numbered, it is easier to link them with people. He said a technical partner has already been engaged to actualize the efficient delivery of the project. The technical partner, Mr. Agu Okechwukwu Samuel,  who also spoke with journalists reiterated that the exercise had already begun and when completed, it would help the area council in planning and allocating projects. He added that the little token realised from the street naming and house numbering will boost government revenue, thereby improving the internally generated revenue of the council. He therefore called on residents to give them the maximum cooperation and support as the exercise would benefit them  while assuring that the project would be delivered within the shortest period.
