Governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Cross River State in the March 9, 2019 election, Senator John Owan-Enoh has said he will no longer challenge the verdict of the election petition tribunal at the Court of Appeal. The Governorship Election Petition Tribunal had declared Governor Ben Ayade as the duly elected governor of the state and dismissed the petition filed by Enoh. Chairman of APC in the state, Sir John Ochala, in a statement confirmed the decision, saying as a party they, too, are not interested in filing an appeal.

However, other candidates of the party who were not satisfied with the judgment of the tribunal as it affects the seats they contested for are going ahead with their appeal,” he said.
