Former Brazil defender Roberto Carlos has lifted the lid on his time at Real Madrid. The full-back, famed for his rocket of a left foot from dead-ball situations, was a key member of Real’s ‘Galactico’ sides, and he admitted that the players may have wielded too much power at the club in that era. Carlos has fond memories of a “crazy” time, especially that spent with a friend from their early days back home in Brazil.
