A pro-APC group in Rivers State, Initiative for Transparent Strategy and Good Leadership has raised alarm over an alleged planned protest in Abuja against the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi. The group, in a press statement issued in Port Harcourt on Monday by its Coordinator, Chizy Enyi, alleged that the protesters were hired persons across the country sponsored by prominent politicians from the state to protest in Abuja over an alleged instigation of crisis in the state chapter of the party by the minister. He alleged that the protesters have been mobilised with a sum of N300 million.

Enyi said the N300 million has already been released to the three coordinators of three NGOs that are to be used for the protest. He said the coordinators of the protest have promised their sponsors that they will close down all streets in Abuja leading to the APC National Secretariat. He said, “I wonder why that huge amount of money will be released to protesters just to insult Rt. Hon. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi while Rivers people are dying of hunger and abject poverty.”  Protesters shut down Port Harcourt over Rivers REC Oshiomhole: A party leader on hot seat APC support group begs Senate to confirm Amaechi as minister‎
