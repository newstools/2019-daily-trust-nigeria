The Senate Committee on Niger Delta yesterday rejected the 2020 capital budget of N23bn for the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs. The committee cited non-completion of projects in the region. The committee’s chairman, Peter Nwaoboshi, who spoke when the Minister of the Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, appeared to defend the 2020 budget of the ministry, said it was discovered during an oversight function that so many projects were abandoned across the nine Niger Delta states.
