Financial expert, Dr. Vincent Nwani, Managing Consultant/CEO, RTC Advisory Ltd has said the return of N50 stamp duty resumption of stamp duty will slow financial inclusion in the country. He said: “The implementation of these charges in Nigeria is capable of weakening the financial inclusion drive and financial development goal as a whole especially within the environmental sphere of business activities which point to enormous size of informal market.” The Federal Government recently mandated the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to strictly implement Merchant Service Charge which would impose more charges on all point of sale (PoS) transactions. OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY To this end, the CBN issued a circular to banks and other stakeholders titled: Review of Process for Merchants Collections on Electronic Transactions. The new policy covers every transaction that occurs on PoS platform, rather than previous regime where charges are allied on aggregate transactions. Thus, for every PoS transaction of N1000 or more, a stamp duty of N50 will be collected. Nwani said: “It is instructive that Citizens are aware that this directive has gone out, they must be aware that it does not change the prices of goods and services they seek to buy but they will have to pay extra 50 if they use the POS machine as a means of settlement. “For example, the directive does not change the price of fuel, however, if anyone chooses to pay with PoS and what the person is purchasing for a thousand Naira or more, he or she will pay stamp duty fee of N50 for each purchase respectively.” Hiccups as Cash-lite begins in Lagos Cashless policy: Distilling CBN’s new transaction charges As stamp duty collection begins
