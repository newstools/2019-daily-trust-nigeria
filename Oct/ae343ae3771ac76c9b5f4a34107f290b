The MacArthur Foundation has announced grants worth more than $6.3million in journalism and media funding to advance anti-corruption efforts in Nigeria. The grants are part of the foundation’s On Nigeria grantmaking, which seeks to reduce corruption by supporting Nigerian-led efforts that strengthen accountability, transparency, and civic participation. The nine grants announced on Tuesday are in continuation of the foundation’s efforts to strengthen investigative and data-driven journalism in Nigeria and reinforce the role played by independent media and citizens in revealing and documenting corruption.
