The chairperson of African Youth Leaders Roundtable, Comrade Ben Duntoye, has called on Kogi youths across the country to support the reelection of Kogi State governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello and his running mate, Chief Edward Onoja, for a second term. Duntoye, who spoke with journalists in Lokoja, said it was important for the people to rally round the governor so that “he can complete the numerous people-oriented projects presently going on in the state”. He said the nomination of the Chief of Staff to the governor, Chief Edward Onoja, as running mate to the governor was a good omen and has shown that he has what it takes to be deputy governor of the state.
