The Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko (AAUA) says it is continuing its efforts at finding the corpse of a final-year female student swept away by flood three weeks ago. Miss Doyinsola Motunrayo Boluwaji, a student of Religious and African Studies, was swept away by flood during a heavy rainfall which lasted for about eight hours. The institution’s management said it is working hard to ensure that Boluwaji’s corpse is recovered.
