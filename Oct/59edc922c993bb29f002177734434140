A former national chairman of Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), Dr. Yunusa Tanko, has said some opposition parties in the country will merge and form a powerful force to clinch the presidential seat in the 2023 general elections. Dr. Tanko, a former presidential candidate and incumbent National Chairman of National Conscience Party (NCP), stated this to our correspondent yesterday in Abuja, shortly after marking the 25th anniversary of the NCP. He also demanded for proportional representation in government.

So we prefer alliance. But that does not mean that we can’t review it. That is why we are saying that for us to move forward, proportional representation is a better option for our electoral system. “We have watched with total dismay how our politics has taken a downward trend, from violence to money politics, intimidation to cross-carpeting among others,” he said.
