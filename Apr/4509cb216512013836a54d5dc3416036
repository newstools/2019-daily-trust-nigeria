The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has warned depot owners and terminal operators not to sell Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), otherwise known as petrol, above the official ex-depot price of N133.28k per litre and also cautioned petroleum products marketers not to sell the product above N145 per litre. Ex-depot price is the ceiling at which depot owners or terminal operators sell products to marketers, while the pump price of a product is the amount consumers buy it from fuel stations. In a press statement, the Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division of NNPC, Mr. Ndu Ughamadu, said the subsisting ex-depot petrol price of N133.28k per litre was consistent with the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agencyâ€™s (PPPRA) template and should be adhered to. Mr. Ughamadu said the NNPC held stock of over one billion litres, adding that imports of 48 vessels of 50 million litres each had been committed for April, 2019, alone.
