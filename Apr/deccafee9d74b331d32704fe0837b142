The aspiration of Mohammed Bago (APC, Chanchaga) in Niger State for the speakership of the House of Representatives suffered a serious setback on Monday following the decision of the state chapter of his party to back Femi Gbajabiamila. The APC in Niger State and eight serving, as well as elected members of the House of Representatives arrived at the decision to back the candidature of Gbajabiamila after a meeting held at the Government House, Minna. The members also threw their support behind the candidature of Ahmed Lawan for the position of senate president. Briefing journalists at the meeting which was said to have been called at the instance of Gov. Abubakar Sani Bello, APC’s state Chairman, Engr. Jibril Imam, said the state chapter and National Assembly members from the state could not go contrary to the stand of the party’s national leadership on who emerged leaders of the 9th Assembly. “Going by what happened during the tenure of the 8th National Assembly, the party at all levels decided to reach a middle ground to enable us present a formidable front on the matter,” he explained. He said the meeting was a follow up to an earlier one by all APC state chairmen and governors from the North Central states held in Abuja. He said the Minna meeting was attended by six serving and elected members from the state, while two others sent in apologies but resolved to abide by all decisions taken at the meeting. Hon. Abdullahi Mahmud, representing Agaie/Lapai constituency in the House of Representatives, who spoke on behalf of his colleagues, said the adoption of Lawan and Gbajabiamila was in tandem with the position of the national leadership of the party, adding that the decision was an affirmation of party supremacy.
