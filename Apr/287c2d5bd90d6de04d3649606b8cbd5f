A joint task force of the FCT comprising of the Abuja Metropolitan Management Council, Department of Development Control, Abuja Environmental Protection Board and Social Development Secretariats, yesterday, raided some night clubs in Abuja. The clubs included Caramelo and Ibiza said to be places where girls danced nude for pay. The raid, which took place at about 2am, yesterday, saw a total of 34 nude girls caught on the spot as they were nude dancing at the Caramelo night club. They were taken to the Utako police station. Speaking to journalists, the Coordinator, Abuja Metropolitan Management Council (AMMC) Umar Shuaibu, said Caramelo night club was among properties converted illegally from residential to night clubs thereby generating nuisance and disturbance of the peace. He also said the plot was zoned as a health clinic in the Utako District land use plan, adding that the building plan was approved as a health clinic. “Before now, the FCT authorities have repeatedly engaged with operators of Caramelo night club and others on the need to quit their operations of commercial night clubs within residential areas but to no avail. FCTA will not renege on its duties to protect the sanity of the Abuja Master plan,” he said. It was learnt that after the raid, the fence and gate house of the Caramelo night club were removed by the Department of Development Control to stop further activity in the premise. The acting secretary of the Social Development Secretariat, Hajiya Safiya Umar, said “These girls need to be rehabilitated because they need help as some of them are married women and rich kids surprisingly.” Noise Pollution: FCTA to remove lounges, night clubs from residential areas Demolished structures resurface in FCT FCT rural communities and the rot in its primary healthcare
