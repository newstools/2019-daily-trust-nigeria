Akinrinade stated this yesterday after inspecting the incident site at Awoba area along the 97 kilometer Nembe-Bonny oil export pipeline. The JTF commander said the fire destroyed vegetation which stretched to about hundred meters. He said the troops on surveillance at a nearby houseboat who arrived at the scene confirmed that all the vandals who breached the pipeline under high pressure died from the explosion and fire that followed.
