The Coalition for Nigeria Movement has strongly frowned at the recent call by the House of Representatives on President Muhammadu Buhari to appear before it over the security situation in the country. The coalition instead said the President and security agencies should be given a pat on the back over recent success recorded over bandits and extremists in Zamfara and Yobe States. High Chief Peremobowei Success, BoT Chairman of the group while addressing newsmen on Thursday, saluted President Buhari and the Nigerian military for the renewed vigor and recent outings against the Boko Haram, bandits and kidnappers in the north western part of the country. Peremobowei said   “We are aware that the president after cutting short his trip to Dubai, held a meeting with all the security chiefs and in the end charged our security agencies to put their acts together and deal ruthlessly with bandits, kidnappers and other security challenges in the country.” “We also commend the president for his recent response to the situation in Zamfara and Kaduna States . The way and manner he has motivated and equipped the military to respond effectively to the challenges in Zamfara and other states in the Northwest has won our heart.” “Operation Sharan Daji, Operation Harbin Kurnama (III) and the newly-launched Operation Puff Adder are focused on Zamfara, Kaduna (including the Abuja-Kaduna Expressway), Katsina, Kogi, and Niger States. These are all multi-agency operations, bringing together the Military, Police, the DSS, and others. The results have been incredible, marvelous and fantastic as can be seen clearly by all Nigerians,” he said.
