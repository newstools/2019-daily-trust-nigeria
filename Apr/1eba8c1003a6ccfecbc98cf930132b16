Shooting and explosions have subsided in Damaturu, Yobe state capital, as the Air Force fighter jet arrived the town. Residents of Maisandari and Mador, where the Boko Haram insurgents invaded, confirmed to Daily Trust on Tuesday evening. Usain Maisandari, a resident, said the fighter jets arrived around 5:45pm and supported the ground soldiers in repelling the terrorists. “The raging gunfire have stopped, only pockets of gunshots which I belief is from the military. I still remain indoor; so I can’t tell if there were casualty as at now but there is a lot of smoke going up,” he said. Another resident, who doesn’t want to be named, said he saw the insurgents in about seven trucks fleeing the location. Today’s attacks have disrupted the five years relative peace that the state capital had enjoyed. It will be recalled that the last Boko Haram attack on the town occurred on January 14, 2015, barely over a month after the terrorists attempted to take over Yobe Government House in a deadly attack that claimed several lives on December 1, 2014.
