Mada and Fulani groups have signed a peace treaty in Akwanga local government of Nasarawa state. The chairman of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), Nasarawa state chapter, Alhaji Hussaini Muhammad, told Daily Trust that, “The meeting follows the violence that led to loss of lives and reprisal attacks against both sides in the once peaceful area.” According to him, the meeting was held in the VIP Lodge of Akwanga local government and attended by traditional, religious, political and youth groups. He said he proposed for the creation of a vigilante committee to consist of sixty youths comprising of thirty Fulanis and thirty Madas including security agencies to patrol the bush and fish out bandits to enhance peace in the area and the state. It could be recalled that it was alleged that a Mada lady was raped by a Fulani, which led to her death and that caused a reprisal attack against the Fulani. Last week, it was also alleged that the Fulanis launched a reprisal attack and killed 16 Mada persons, which in turn led to another reprisal attack against the Fulani with the attendant loss of lives, cattle and houses burnt.
