The Commissioner for Women Affairs, Barr. Amina Musa Guar, has said that her purported suspension by the Paikoro local government chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was orchestrated by those allegedly eying her position. Reacting to the emergence of posters against her reappointment in the state capital, Barr. Guar alleged that some people in certain parts of her local government were not comfortable with a woman, especially from a minority section, to be a political leader, representing them. She said some people in her constituency do not want Governor Abubakar Sani Bello to reappoint her into the state executive council. Guar, who challenged her accusers to explain her sins that amounted to anti-party activities, claimed that some politicians in her local government were not happy with the way and manner she carried out her skill acquisition programme.
