The Presidency has described the conviction of former Chief Justice of Nigeria, Mr. Walter Onnoghen, by the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) as a victory for the anti-corruption policy of the Buhari administration. Reacting to the verdict yesterday, the Presidency said the outcome of the trial demonstrates clearly that the law is no respecter of persons, titles, social or political connections. Presidential spokesperson, Garba Shehu, said the essence of the rule of law is to hold everyone accountable equally, regardless of their high or law status in the society. According to the presidency, the war against corruption is all encompassing and is not designed to persecute anyone for political or other reasons.
