Women in Imo State under the auspices of Assembly of Concerned Igbo Women Leaders of Thought in Nigeria and The Diaspora, have taken INEC to task over the non-issuance of certificate of return to Governor Rochas Okorocha, who was declared winner of Imo West senatorial seat in the February 23 presidential and National Assembly elections. The women also decried what they described as the growing resentment against the South East region by the leadership of the ruling APC in not zoning any of the leadership positions in the National Assembly to the region. Rising from their meeting in Owerri, the convener of the assembly,  Barrister Ijeoma Igboanusi, said it was an act of ingratitude for the party to treat Okorocha that way after building the party from the scratch in the state. Igboanusi said, “History remains our witness. Without Okorocha, the APC would have been another regional party struggling for relevance without a nationalistic appeal.” She described as despicable that the party could look the other way when the rights of one of their foremost founding fathers were being trampled upon. She said, “The women leaders of the South-East having patiently waited and keenly watched the dramatic turnaround cum actions of the INEC in Imo West senatorial zone in withholding Okorocha’s certificate of return, are poised to ask what kind of democracy we are practicing in Nigeria!” The women also decried the position of the party in zoning the leadership positions in the National Assembly, saying that “the Igbo constitute a leg in the tripod stand of the party. Since the president is from the North, the vice president from the South-west, it is only fair and just that the Senate presidency or the Speaker of the House of Representatives be zoned to the Igbo in the South-east.”  As Okorocha battles for political survival… Fresh setback for APC peace moves in Zamfara, Ogun, Imo Can APGA unseat Okorocha in Imo?
