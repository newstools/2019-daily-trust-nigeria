Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has condemned the unwarranted and unbridled kidnappings and killings of innocent people on the highways and frequent attacks on villages by some armed bandits which has led to the death of hundreds of innocent lives particularly in the Northern part of the country.  A statement signed by ACF National Publicity Secretary Muhammad Ibrahim Biu on Thursday in Kaduna, appealed to the Federal Government to seriously reexamine its security apparatus and take adequate measures that will increase the number of police personnel, train them and provide equipment and other logistic support to effectively tackle this menace.  ACF called on the security agencies to employ new strategies and intelligence gathering needed to effectively smoke-out the kidnappers and bandits from their enclaves and hideouts. The Police Force should deploy more troops to the affected states and highways to not only repel attacks but go after the perpetrators and bring them to book. ACF said that the recent frequent kidnappings and attacks on the people,especially along Kaduna/Abuja express highway and many villages in Zamfara, Sokoto, Katsina and Kaduna states as well as many parts of the country is cruel, barbaric and inhuman.  “The establishment of Military Joint Task Force and other security operational command bases in Zamfara, Sokoto and other flash point states to combat the bandits activities in the region need to redouble their efforts in order to put an end to this daily loss of innocent lives and destruction of property.” ACF condemns Biu blast, raises concern over armed banditry Kidnap: ACF counters Afenifere on restrictions of Fulani herdsmen ACF condemns Kaduna, Borno attacks
