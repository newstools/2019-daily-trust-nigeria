The governorship candidate of the Action Democratic Party (ADP) in the March 9, 2019, gubernatorial election in Rivers State, Victor Fingesi, has dragged Governor Nyesom Wike and the INEC to the election petitions tribunal. Fingesi who disclosed this at a press briefing in Port Harcourt, said the return of Wike as governor-elect of Rivers State was not in compliance with the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended). He said the ADP was asking the tribunal to nullify the election and order for a fresh one. “We know that a lot of Rivers people and other stakeholders are not happy with INEC and the return of Chief Nyesom Wike as the governor-elect, which we are challenging as not substantially in compliance with the Electoral Act. “We are asking the tribunal to nullify the election and order for fresh election. This is because anybody who is the governor in a democratic dispensation carries the sacred mandate of the people. “No matter the expediency, he must have majority of lawful votes and the process and procedure must comply with the laws of our land,” Fingesi said. He warned that no attempt should be made to turn the election as a mere vacuum-filling charade by imposing anybody on Rivers people as governor, adding that even INEC admitted that the election was marred by widespread irregularities. “We shall pursue the matter to its logical conclusion; even to the highest court of the land,” he said.
