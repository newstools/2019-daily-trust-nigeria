The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), yesterday, presented a certificate of return to the re-elected   Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, at the commission’s headquarters in Port Harcourt. Gov. Wike was re-elected on March 9, 2019, with the collation of election results concluded on April 3. Speaking, Gov. Wike dedicated the certificate to the people of Rivers State who he said overwhelmingly voted for him. He berated the Nigerian Army for the negative role they allegedly played during the 2019 general elections in Rivers State. During the speech, Gov. Wike reportedly declared that he was tired of being a governor and would not contest for a third term even if the constitution permitted him. According to Wike: “Nobody can be more than the state. So, for me, I want total peace in Rivers State. All of us should come back, wherever you are, whether in the federal or local government, come and work for the interest of the state. “I’ll not be governor forever. I only have four more years. After the four years, I’m gone. The constitution does not allow for third term. Even if it does, bye bye, I’m tired. I’ll not. “I use to tell my wife every day whenever I wake up, I say thank God, you never can tell the next day, what will happen. And any day I have opportunity like this, I’ll speak my mind. I am not afraid; nobody has monopoly to take my life. I will die the day God says I will die,” he said. 2019: Wike plans for a comeback to Rivers’ Brick House Peterside expresses doubt over Wike’s Supreme Court victory Wike urges Rivers people to vote Atiku
