Governor of Kaduna State, Malam Nasir El-Rufai has urged communities in the state to shun reprisals in resolving differences. The governor, who was at an IDP camp in Maraban Kajuru in Kajuru Local Government of the state on Wednesday, said that an attitude of attacks and reprisals only produced pain and suffering. Governor El-Rufai said he had directed relevant agencies to reassess the condition of the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) who are from different communities and enable them to return to their communities soon, stressing that he was saddened by the situation. “What we saw is unfortunate, but we must speak out and tell our people the right thing to be done. An eye for eye is not a solution to the vicious cycles of killings and will complicate and undermine collective efforts,” he stated. The governor said all communities must resist the temptation to take the law into their own hands, saying security personnel and assets cannot be in every inch of the state, hence communities must stop the abnormality of taking the laws into their own hands.
