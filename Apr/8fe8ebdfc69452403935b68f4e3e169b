The Lagos State governor, Mr Akinwunmi Ambode, and a professor of Economics, Pat Utomi, have advocated for teamwork among civil servants in the state. The two men made the call in Lagos yesterday at a training programme, tagged, ‘Team Building and Synergy Workshop for Peak Performance’, which was organised by the Lagos State Ministry of Establishments, Training and Pension in Lagos. Ambode, who was represented by the state’s Commissioner for Establishments, Training and Pension, Dr Akintola, Benson Oke, hinged the state’s improved productivity on a civil service with staff members who were ready to work in synergy and good team spirit. “Our administration places emphasis on success. But success is better achieved when there is synergy of purpose. The Lagos State government deserves that synergy, hence our emphasis on trainings like this, which is helping the civil service to appreciate and acquire the benefits that trainings bring to bear on good governance,” Ambode said. Similarly, Utomi, who was a facilitator at the event, said at the core of corporate success or government sustainability was the need for teamwork. He, however, emphasised shared organisational goals and values, which he described as the propellers of team building.
