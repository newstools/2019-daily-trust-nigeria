Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has graduated 11,000 tailors, welders, photographers and other persons trained on various skills by the Industrial Training Tund (ITF). Speaking at the graduation ceremony held in Abuja, yesterday, Osinbajo said 450,000 Nigerians have been trained and empowered with start-up packs to start their own businesses in the last two years. Represented by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, the vice president said out of the 450,000 people trained, 90 per cent of the beneficiaries have gone on to become entrepreneurs that are even employing others. “I want to use this opportunity to task our youth that as leaders of tomorrow, a lot is expected of them. I also want to assure you that as a government, we will do all that is necessary to ensure your capacities are developed and fully utilized,” he said. The Director General of the Industrial Training Tund (ITF), Sir Joseph Ntung Ari, said the beneficiaries graduated before the 2019 elections in various trade areas such as welding and fabrication, plumbing and pipe fitting, tailoring, aluminum, tiling, Plaster of Paris (POP) as well as photography. “These trades were carefully selected based on their potential to directly impact the national economy,” he said. Ari said under the NISDP, over 150,000 Nigerians have been equipped with skills for employability and entrepreneurship. He said surveys have revealed that in all cases where the trainees were provided with kits, over 90 percent earned reasonable livelihoods as entrepreneurs. “Our target this year is to vigorously work to equip Nigerians with lifelong skills in agriculture, construction, transport and the services sectors that were identified by the survey to have great potential for job creation,” he said.
