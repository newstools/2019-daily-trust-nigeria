The three senators from Katsina State have said their decision to throw their weight behind the candidacy of Sen. Ahmed Lawan for the senate presidency was informed by their belief he is the best among all those that have shown interest for the office. Speaking on behalf of the senators, Bello Mandiya (Katsina South) said Lawal’s 20 years in the senate had made him a force to reckon with, especially in terms of experience and seniority. “Presently, his (Lawan’s) position of senate leader also gives him an edge…In developed democracies world over, there won’t be an election even; it will be a unanimous decision. “It recently happened in the US. We believe in him and hold him in high esteem. Most importantly, Lawan will not betray the trust of our President and political leader, Muhammadu Buhari,” Mandaya added. The other two senators are Kabir Barkiya (Katsina Central) and Ahmed Kaita (Katsina North). He recalled that the National Assembly was not inaugurated on May 29, 1999, when Nigeria returned to civilian rule because consultations were still ongoing at the party level. “So the party hierarchy must be allowed to choose the people that they know would deliver on their agenda,” he said. Speaking further, he rated the performance of INEC in the 2019 general elections, saying the use of the card readers improved the credibility of the elections. He advised that Nigeria should avoid a situation where assessment by international observers would determine the credibility of her elections, saying such would amount to interference by the foreign observers.
