The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), on Friday, granted Permit to five Meter Assets Provider (MAP) firms to sell 1.4 million meters to customers of Abuja and Jos Distribution Companies (DisCos). A statement by NERC spokesman, Usman Abba Arabi, today, said from May 1, 2019, the MAPs will sell a single phase meter for N36,991 and three phase meter for N67,055. Upon payment, the meters will be installed for customers within 10 working days. NERC added: “These costs are inclusive of supply, installation, maintenance and replacement of meters over its technical life.” A breakdown shows that, of the 1.4m meters, Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) will provide 900,000 units, using three MAPs; Mojec will supply 487,000, Meron will bring 213,000 units and Turbo will supply the other 200,000. Jos Electricity Distribution Company (JEDC) has 500,000 meters to be supplied by two MAP firms, Triple 7 and Mojec. “The Commission shall monitor closely, the rollout plan of distribution licensees and overall compliance with the regulation and various service agreements by the MAP and electricity distribution licensees,” NERC noted.
