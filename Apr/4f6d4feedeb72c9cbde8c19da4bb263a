The Rivers State chapter of the PDP says the ruling of the Supreme Court which struck out the consolidated appeals of the Rivers APC and Tonye Cole for lacking in merit has once more heightened the dignity of the apex court as the last hope of the common man. The state PDP Chairman, Bro. Felix Obuah, in a press statement issued in Port Harcourt yesterday, said having exhausted all avenues of defusing the choice of Gov. Nyesom Wike by the mass of Rivers people and failed, the APC has no choice but to acknowledge the obvious fact that his re-election has divine endorsement which should make the party “joyfully” join the rest of Rivers people in the divine mandate. Obuah called for an end to the beating of war drums so that Gov. Wike could concentrate on his service delivery and good governance to the state. He also commended the wisdom and maturity exhibited by Gov. Wike while the alleged APC conspiracies lasted and urged him to  continue to see Rivers State as one united indivisible stock of God’s people.
