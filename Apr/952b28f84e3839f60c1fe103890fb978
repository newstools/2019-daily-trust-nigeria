The Etsu of Karu, Nassarawa State, HRH (Dr) Luka Panya-Baba has solicited the help of the FCTA for intervention projects aimed at reducing the strain on existing infrastructure, occasioned by increase in population in the community. The chief, who led a delegation of prominent indigenes to the FCT minister’s office in Abuja on Friday, attributed the population increase to the proximity of the community to the FCT and the relatively cheaper accommodation cost in the area. Responding, the minister of  Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Malam Muhammad Musa Bello,  said the FCT Administration was working with all stakeholders in states neighbouring the FCT to ensure the mutual growth and development of both the FCT and those areas. He commended the leadership of Karu Chiefdom for ensuring that the ingredients needed for growth were present there. “Karu Chiefdom is a community that is destined to grow because you have opened your arms to people from all over the country. They are bringing development to your place and thus, it is a vibrant economic community. “All that is needed is minimum intervention with respect to needed infrastructure and then it will be like any other developed community because the ingredients for growth and prosperity are already there in your kingdom and I congratulate you for that”, he said. Malam Bello expressed confidence in the leadership of Nasarawa state, adding that the FCT was willing to interface with the state government for the mutual benefit of both the FCT and Nasarawa State.
