The APC in Sokoto State has promised to reclaim its alleged stolen mandate during the governorship election at the Election Petitions Tribunal. The State APC chairman, Alhaji Isa Sadiq Achida, who spoke to party supporters, said the mandate victory of Governor Aminu Tambuwal would be challenged at the tribunal that would soon commence sitting in Sokoto. Achida said the recent governorship elections were marred by myriad of electoral offences like vote buying, over voting, ballot box snatching and stuffing, intimidation,  non-use of card reader machines, duplication of votes and outright disenfranchisement of thousands of voters across the state, among others. He dismissed allegations that the APC used the powers of some federal agencies during the 2019 governorship polls against the PDP and Governor Tambuwal, describing the allegation as unsubstantiated, inefficacious and ineffectual.
