The Vice-President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo on Monday met behind closed doors with Sen. Ali Ndume at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the senator arrived at the villa at about 3:20 pm and went straight to the vice-president’s office for the meeting. The agenda of the meeting was unknown to State House correspondents. NAN, however, learnt that it was not unconnected with the forthcoming election of a new leadership for the ninth National Assembly (NASS). The national leadership of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) had earlier enjoined all APC members-elect in the national assembly to support the party’s choice candidates for the leadership positions. The party has endorsed the candidature of Sen. Ahmed Lawan for the seat of Senate President and Rep. Femi Gbajabiamila for the position of Speaker of the House Representatives. But Sen. Ndume has continued to insist to contest for the seat of senate president.
