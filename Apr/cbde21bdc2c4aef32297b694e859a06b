The African Development Bank (AfDB) has said Nigeria and six other African countries are to benefit from the Sorghum and Millet Compact of Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT). The bank said the programme was part of its plan to ensure food security in the Sahel Region in a document titled: “Food Security in the Sahel’’ made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Abuja. AfDB said the bank was set to launch the programme in Mali on Thursday under TAAT which it initiated as part of its Feed Africa Initiative (FAI). The bank named other countries: Burkina Faso, Niger, Mali, Senegal, Sudan and Chad as beneficiaries of the planned support programme. It said it aspired to significantly increase agricultural productivity via the deployment of proven and high-performance technologies to millions of African farmers. “The sorghum and millet compact targets about 40 to 50 per cent of African farmers with technologies relevant to boosting agricultural productivity and self-sufficiency by 2025,” it said.
