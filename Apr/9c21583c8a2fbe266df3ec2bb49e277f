The national leader of APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, should not be allowed to control the party by using excessive fiat in determining the new leadership of the incoming 9th Assembly, a chieftain of the party, Abdulmajid Danbilki Commander, has said. Commander, a staunch supporter of President Muhammadu Buhari, said Tinubu was dictating the tune of northern politics and the affairs of APC under current moves to get those loyal to him emerge as leaders of the National Assembly. In a statement in Kano, Commander said it was high time northern politicians detached themselves from acceding to Tinubu’s “dictatorial tendency of making notable northern politicians subservient to his whims and caprices.” He said northern politicians would no longer be used as cannon-fodder in promoting the postulations of certain politicians since they were at an ample liberty to discern what was politically expedient. He pointed out that in an ideal democratic setting the will of an individual must not be allowed to surpass the collective interest of those having a stake in the polity.
