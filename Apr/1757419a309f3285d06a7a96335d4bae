Stakeholders in oil and gas sector will on meet Monday in Lagos to brainstorm on the way forward for the sector in terms of reforms and securing greater benefits for Nigeria and her citizens.  The event, organized by the Nigeria Natural Resource Charter (NNRC), a not-for-profit, policy institute that promotes reforms in Nigeria’s petroleum sector; and OrderPaper Advocacy Initiative (OAI), will take place on the 29th of April, 2019, at the Eko Hotel, Victoria Island Lagos.  The programme is an off-shoot of the Development Dialogue Series (DDS) of OrderPaper Advocacy, a non-governmental organization focused on policy-related, especially legislative engagements that expand the frontiers of good governance and deepening of democratic practice in Nigeria.   It is being organized against the backdrop of the ding-dong affair between the National Assembly and President Muhammadu Buhari on the Petroleum Industry and Governance Bill (PIGB) which was recently passed again by the former after an initial rejection by the latter.   Concerns have continued to mount over prevailing uncertainty around the stalemated reforms in oil and gas, which many believe, has a negative impact on the economy with increasing investor flight and a continually dwindling resource base for Nigeria.   In a statement signed by Tengi George-Ikoli, Program Coordinator, NNRC and Oke Epia, Executive Director of OAI on Thursday, the dialogue seeks to consider the economic, financial and social implications of not embracing reforms in the petroleum sector.  Additionally, it will determine ways to engage with the federal government on alternative reforms for the sector.  Representatives from the government, legislature, oil and gas industry executives, the academia, the media, and civil society organizations are expected at the event.
