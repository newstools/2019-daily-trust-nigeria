The Oyo State Governor, Senator Abiola Ajimobi, on Friday, said he had no reason to regret or worry over his failed senatorial bid and his unsuccessful attempt to hand over to a successor from his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC). He said God’s kindness made it possible for him to break the second term jinx and record many unprecedented feats, saying he had no reason to regret over his senatorial election loss. The governor said this while addressing guests at a thanksgiving service to mark the 60th birthday of his wife, Mrs Florence Ajimobi, held at the Government House, Ibadan. On hand to rejoice with the state’s first family were the Wife of the Vice President, Mrs Dolapo Osinbajo; Wife of Ekiti State governor, Erelu Bisi Fayemi; her Imo State counterpart, Mrs Nkechi Okorocha; Wife of Ogun State Governor-elect, Mrs Bamidele Abiodun; and Wife of the immediate past governor of Osun State, Mrs Sherifat Aregbesola, among other dignitaries. Having ruled for eight uninterrupted years, which marked the first in the history of the state, the governor said that God had been merciful and kind to him to use him to rewrite the history of the state for good. He said: “God has been kind to me for making it possible for me to break the second term jinx, and in the last eight years, it is on record that we recorded so many unprecedented feats for which posterity and history makers will be kind to us.” Oyo APC rejects consensus, opts for indirect primaries Ajimobi accepts defeat, congratulates Balogun, others Oyo gov’ship: Ajimobi, Ladoja still manoeuvring
