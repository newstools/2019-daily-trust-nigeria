The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project has called on Governor Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa State to reject the proposed life pension which members of the state house of assembly proposed for themselves. SERAP Deputy Director Kolawole Oluwadare, in a letter weekend, said the bill passed last week by the lawmakers amounted to an incorrect and improper performance of public functions. “It’s clearly an abuse of legislative functions by the lawmakers. Rather than sponsoring bills that would improve access of children in Bayelsa to quality education, the lawmakers are taking advantage of their entrusted public positions to propose a bill to collect large severance benefits. “The people of Bayelsa would expect you, as their governor, to use your entrusted public office to act in the public interest, including by rejecting the life pension bill and prevailing upon the House of Assembly to immediately drop the bill.” APC kicks as Bayelsa assembly approves life pension for members Dickson signs Community Safety Bill Dickson orders arrest of APC lawmaker over Brass violence
