Do not be discouraged. Our stand and resolve on the progress of our state remains intact. If Osun is good, families will be good. So, we will not stop in reaching out to people and impacting lives. Osun must move forward.” Ogunbiyi’s Press Secretary, Ismail Afolabi explained that the Easter fiesta was held at Idera de Movement office in Osogbo, to enable people from all parts of the state participate in the praises and worships to commemorate Jesus Christ’s resurrection from death.

Don’t be rattled about the struggles on ground, God is at work. When the time of God comes, it can’t be hindered,” Ogunbiyi said.
