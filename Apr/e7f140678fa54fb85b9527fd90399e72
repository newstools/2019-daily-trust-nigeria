The Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP) has said it breached no public procurement law in the award of an N88 million contract for the empowerment of 22 Niger Delta youths in barbing and beauty salon business. PAP said the contract, awarded to Messrs Tovo Vicks Nigeria Enterprises Limited, was in line with its mandate of providing human capital development and skills acquisition for beneficiaries of the amnesty programme towards deepening peace and stability in the Niger Delta. Special Assistant (Media), Mr. Murphy Ganagana, to the Special Adviser to the President on Niger Delta and Coordinator of the amnesty programme, Prof. Charles Dokubo, in a statement, said the N88m contract sum for 22 beneficiaries was based on a business set-up template of N4m per beneficiary. Mr. Ganagana explained that the cost included provision of refresher/entrepreneurial training course to prepare beneficiaries for effective management of their businesses, land acquisition or shop rent for use by the beneficiaries, business name registration, tax papers, account opening and branding, provision of mentorship/monitoring and evaluation for three months after successful set-up process for beneficiaries and comprehensive documentation of empowered beneficiaries. “We wish to state that the contract was awarded in line with due process and the company, Tovo Vicks Nigeria Ent. Limited, is duly registered by the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) with RC 1150012. “Therefore, Prof. Dokubo did no wrong by awarding the contract in furtherance of the mandate of the Presidential Amnesty Programme. However, it should be noted that implementation of the contract is yet to commence.” Ex-millitants’ protest mischievous – Amnesty Office Presidency trains 1,165 ex-militants in N/Delta Re: N/Delta militants want Amnesty Coordinator sacked
