The sponsor of the just concluded Delta Principals’ Cup Competition, Zenith Bank, has expressed delight over the standard of the 2019 edition of the annual tournament. Zenith Bank’s GM and Head, Delta Zone, Lucky Ighade, says the organization is excited that the tournament has been getting better with every edition. “The boys are all very talented. I am particularly impressed with the standard of the final match. Our team monitoring the competition also gave us positive reports about the standard exhibited during the early stages of the tournament even at Local Government level. “We are happy that some of these boys will in future be good ambassadors of the country in football. That is why we are so proud that it is getting bigger and better with every edition,” he said. Ighade added that the motive of the organization was already being realized because reports suggest that some of the products of the competition are in national teams.
