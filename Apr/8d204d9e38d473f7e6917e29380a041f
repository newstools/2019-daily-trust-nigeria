Mudslides and flooding caused by torrential rain have killed 32 people in Durban and the wider KwaZulu-Natal province, officials say, with the death toll expected to rise. Among those killed was a six-month-old baby. Dozens have been taken to hospital and search and rescue teams are looking for more survivors under the rubble of collapsed buildings. Local roads have flooded, sewers have been blocked and electricity pylons brought down. Road safety campaigners Arrive Alive shared photos of affected areas yesterday. Two universities and a number of schools are shut after the storms hit on Monday evening. A severe weather warning remains in place in most parts of South Africa. Meanwhile, more localised flooding is expected in coastal areas. Last week, heavy rains were blamed for the collapse of a church wall in KwaZulu-Natal, which killed at least 13 people.
