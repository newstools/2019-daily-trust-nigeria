Jumia and Mastercard have agreed to become an investor and form a strategic partnership to grow e-commerce operations and support the digital transformation in Africa. Under the new agreement, the two companies will look to build on Mastercard’s presence across Africa, bringing its deep knowledge and expertise in payment solutions and technologies to spark new innovations and spur development in new customer segments, a statement said yesterday. As part of the deal, the companies have also agreed to build on their current efforts to accelerate the adoption of electronic payment platforms among consumers and merchants. Currently, e-commerce is nascent in Africa and accounts for less than 1% of total retail volumes. There are however over 400million internet users across the continent – amongst the largest in the world – which highlights the vast potential for growth. The co-CEO of Jumia, Sacha Poignonnnec said Jumia and Mastercard first partnered in 2016 with the successful launch of Mastercard Payment Gateway Solutions in several markets. He further explained that, that same year, Mastercard supported Jumia in the launch of JumiaPay, the payment service of the Jumia platform that facilitates transactions for consumers and sellers. “We are delighted to strengthen our existing partnership with Mastercard, and consolidate Jumia’s position as the leading e-commerce platform in Africa. This investment highlights the strategic synergies between the two companies, as we both seek to develop the payments ecosystem and drive financial inclusion across Africa,” he said.
