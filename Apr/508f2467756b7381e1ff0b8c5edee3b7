The Nigeria Air Force yesterday in Katsina launched its “Operation Tsaftar Daji” with modern fighter jets to fight bandits and kidnappers in Dajin Rugu forest. The jets include Alpha jets, MI 35, Augusta, Bel 412 and some specialised surveillance aircrafts. Flagging up the operation at its command base in Katsina, the Air officer commanding the special operation, AVM Napolean Bali, said the operation was a final push to sanitise the forest that had for long served as a hideout for bandits and miscreants. He said the operation would minimise civilian casualties by following warfare procedures. According to him, intelligence and cooperation from the locals is highly desirable in the final push. He said the operation would run alongside all the ongoing military operations of the Air Force and the army to ensure a resounding success.
