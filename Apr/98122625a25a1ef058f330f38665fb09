The Kaduna State Peace Commission on Monday took a fact-finding mission to Kajuru Local Government Area of the state to unravel the causes of killings and destruction of property in the area. Led by its chairman, Bishop Josiah Idowu-Fearon, the commission engaged stakeholders in a dialogue at the local government secretariat where they cried out for the release of some Adara leaders who had been in detention for some time. Chairman, Kajuru LGA, Cafra Caino, represented by his deputy and acting chairman, Mr. Jagaba Kutara, said: “Over 40, 000 internally displaced persons are currently taking refuge in eight camps in the area. We are in disarray over the attack because just last Wednesday, there was another attack.” The state chairmen of the Jama’atu Nasril Islam, the Christian Association of Nigeria and the reconciliation committee, Alhaji Dahiru Kajuru, Mr. Makama Mazadu and Mr. Patrick Maigari respectively called for the release of Adara community leaders, saying “Their release will fast track reconciliation and engender confidence in the process.” Also, the chairman, Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, urged the chairman of the local government to grant Fulani people freedom of movement in the area alleging that “There are areas a Fulani man cannot go to.” Kaduna: Peace commission takes fact-finding mission to Kajuru LG Kajuru crisis: Release Adara leaders in detention, stakeholders tell El-Rufa’i Kajuru crisis: Release Adara leaders in detention – Stakeholders
