The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described Governor Nyesom Wike’s victory at the Rivers State governorship election as a triumph of good over evil. In a statement last night by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party said the victory reinforced the confidence of the people in the resoluteness of asserting their democratic choice of leadership as well as standing in defence of their mandate to the end. The PDP congratulated all its candidates, who won elections at all levels across the country and assured those “pursuing their stolen mandates at the tribunals” that the party was fully behind them. “The party says Governor Wike’s record 700,000 votes margin of victory over the disgraced combined anti-people forces of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the African Action Congress (AAC) and compromised security agencies speaks volume of the resilience of the people of Rivers State in the face of intimidations, harassment and manipulations by oppressive forces.
