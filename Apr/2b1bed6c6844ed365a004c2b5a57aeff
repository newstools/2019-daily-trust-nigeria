The Senate Minority Whip, Sen. Philip Aduda, has urged protesting indigenes of Abuja to remain calm, while the Senate investigates alleged clash with the military which reportedly led to the death of one person. Aduda, who made the plea in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja, said the matter was already before the Senate. He said the matter “has to do with the invasion of the military on some farmlands in Tunga Maje, which cost the lives of some of our people. I have raised the matter before the Senate in plenary and I will continue to talk to the people to be law abiding since I have raised it in Senate for justice to be done. “The Senate has asked the chairman Senate Committee on Defence to immediately move in, get to the military authorities and get back to the Senate. “I urge them to remain calm while the committee carries out its assignment and the Senate intervenes,” he said.
