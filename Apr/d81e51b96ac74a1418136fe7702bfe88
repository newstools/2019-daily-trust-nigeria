The Board of Trustees (BoT) of the PDP has assured that it will work with other organs of the party and its candidates whose mandates were allegedly stolen in the just concluded general elections to reclaim them. Reading a communiqué at the end of the 65th meeting of the board held, yesterday, in Abuja, the BoT Chairman, Senator Walid Jibrin, said the board also decried the militarization of the elections. “The BoT notes with dismay, the systematic erosion of the gains made under the PDP administration in enhancing the credibility of the electoral process over the years, and frowns at the way all those gains are being distorted and eroded by the present administration. “The BoT calls on all Nigerians, especially our teeming PDP supporters to stay calm and be law-abiding, as we believe justice will take its proper place despite the traumatization of the judicial arm of government by the present administration,” the board said.
