Fidelis Alfa has assured the people of the state of liberation and better days ahead as he felicitates with the Christian faithfuls on the occasion of Easter celebration.

He tasked the people to reflect on their economic, welfare, security and peace as it affects the failure of government in Kogi State. According to him, death and resuscitation power of Jesus will give him the much needed energy and wherewithal to deliver Kogi for the PDP come November 2nd, when elected as the state Chairman of PDP. “I’m passionate about the wellbeing of our people, I receive calls of frustration, poverty every day from Kogi and this leaves me devastated each time I receive them. “Hence, I decided to join the race for state championship of the party in order to be able to midwife a process that will give PDP a resounding victory by November 2nd,” Hon. Alfa added. He assured Kogi people of Kogi of a people-oriented and masses driven PDP when elected. Kogi PDP chairmanship aspirant vows to reposition party Kogi: As Idris steps out in 2012 17
