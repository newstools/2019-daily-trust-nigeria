The Federal Government has approved N1.3 billion death benefits to be paid to 497 next-of-kin of deceased federal workers before the end of this month. The Permanent Secretary, Service Welfare Office (SWO), Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation (OHCSF), Mrs Didi Walson-Jack, said this Wednesday in Abuja at the 2nd Permanent Secretary’s Quarterly Forum with Labour leaders in Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). The event was themed, “Managing the Challenges of Emerging Realities in Labour Negotiations in the Federal Civil Service”. According to her, the Pension Reform Act 2014 marked the beginning of the Group Life Assurance (GLA) Scheme under the OHoCSF for federal public servants and the sum of N1.5bn has been released by the Ministry of Finance for payment of some of the backlog of death benefits for the period not covered by the insurance policy. She said that the figure was part of the 563 next-of-kin of the beneficiaries screened for payment across 116 MDAs in January. “In order to make payments to deceased next-of-kin, a service-wide verification exercise of a backlog of death benefits claims of 563 deceased officers cutting across 116 MDAs was conducted in January 2019. To confirm the veracity of the claim requests submitted by the MDAs, after the verification exercise, a total of 497 next-of-kin of deceased officers were cleared for payment of N1.3bn,” the Permanent Secretary said. Speaking earlier, the Director, Employee Relations and Welfare (ERW), Service Welfare Office, OHoCSF, Mr. Alfred Abba, said that regular and periodic government-union interaction was a platform for sharing ideas, receiving updates on developments on labour-related matters affecting the MDAs.
