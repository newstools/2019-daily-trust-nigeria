The Edo State Government has said it has concluded plans to develop a database for licensed miners operating in the state. It said the database was part of Governor Godwin Obaseki administration’s plan to guarantee adequate security and conducive environment to enable the miners operate freely. The commissioner for Minerals, Oil and Gas, Joseph Ugheoke, disclosed this in Benin after a quarterly meeting with members of the Edo State chapter of the Miners Association of Nigeria (MAN). He assured of the state government’s support and commitment in their operations and to create more jobs in the state. Ugheoke said a decision was reached at the meeting to provide for the security needs of the association in the Edo State Security Architecture codenamed ‘Operation Wabaizigan’.  “There are issues of kidnapping and robbery in some parts of the state and this is affecting mining activities, particularly in Edo North. We will ensure that within the next two weeks, all mine workers will have a database that the government security can key into. The intention of the state government is to extend ‘Operation Wabaizigan’ to other parts of the state. Earlier, the chairman, Edo State Chapter of MAN, Mr Michael Okhumode, commended the state government for the measures to ensure adequate security for their operations in the state. He said members of the association would work closely with the government to ensure an increase in mining activities in the state to boost productivity and generate more revenue.
