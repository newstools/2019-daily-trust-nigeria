The Sisterhood Africa/Global, a ministry under New Wine Outpouring Ministries, has lost its founder and visionaire, Prophetess Nonnie Roberson. Prophetess Roberson, who is also the President of Women in Clergy, died after an emergency surgery on Tuesday (April 9, 2019) at about 4:00pm GMT. A statement from the group said until her death, she was married to Joseph Roberson and blessed with four children. “She was a burden bearer, a prayer warrior and a blessing to this generation. For her “… to live is Christ to die is gain” (Phil1.21). “We believe it is gain to the kingdom of God that our precious angel has gone to be with the Lord. She is indeed in a better place and we take solace in that. “Further announcement concerning her funeral arrangements will be made shortly,” the statement added.
