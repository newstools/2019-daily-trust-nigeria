Gunmen  suspected to be kidnappers have abducted one of the sons of a renowned politician and businessman,  Yusuf Musa Sokodabo, at Naharati  in Abaji. A resident of the area, who identified himself as Danlami, said the incident happened at about 01:00am on Sunday when the gunmen invaded the victim’s house. Danlami said the gunmen scaled the fence and broke into the house before whisking the boy away through a bush path. “I went to ease myself inside the bush just some few metres from my house. It was there I sighted some men. I thought they were vigilante members, but few minutes later, I started hearing gunshots and discovered that they were kidnappers,” he said. He added that the kidnappers shot severally into the air to scare residents of the area from raising alarm. A member of the victim’s family who preferred anonymity confirmed the incident to our reporter, saying  the family had established contact with the kidnappers. “Even this morning, we  reached out to the kidnappers and they are demanding for a N5m ransom.  Negotiations are still ongoing as I don’t want to disclose everything for security  reasons,” he said. FCT Police Command Spokesman, ASP Adamu Gajere Tanimu, when contacted said he would reach out to the Abaji DPO and get back to our reporter but he did not at the time of filing this report.
