Osun State Government has provided free train ride for people travelling home from Lagos to Osogbo for Easter celebration. The Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr. Adeniyi Adesina, said the objective of the initiative was to assist the holidaymakers to return home for the celebration. Those travelling from towns on the route between Lagos state and Osun state will also benefit from the free trip. The train will stop over at designated Train stations in Ogun and Oyo states. According to the schedule of movement, the train will depart from the Iddo Terminus in Lagos by 10am on Friday, April 19, with the expected 6pm arrival time at the Nelson Mandela Freedom Park Train Station in Osogbo. On the return trip on Monday (April 22), the train will depart from the Nelson Mandela Freedom Park Train Station in Osogbo at 10am with the expected 6pm arrival time at Iddo Terminus in Lagos. It is the second time the Oyetola administration will provide free train transport for citizens going home for religious celebration. The first time was in December 2018, for people travelling home for Christmas, barely one month after the governor took office.
