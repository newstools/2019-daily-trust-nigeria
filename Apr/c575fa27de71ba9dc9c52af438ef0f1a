The PDP chairman in Kano State, Alhaji Rabiu Sulaiman Bichi, has exonerated his party, Sen. Rabiu Kwankwaso and the governorship candidate Abba Yusuf from any act of violence that allegedly compromised the electoral process during the supplementary election. Bichi, who reacted to a statement credited to the Buhari Media Organization (BMO) over the violence that marred the recently held supplementary governorship election, said it was unfortunate for the group to take sides with Governor Abdullahi Ganduje and his cohorts whose alleged sponsored thugs perpetuated massive votes buying. BMO was reported to have accused the PDP and Kwankwaso as perpetrators of the violence in the aftermath of the highly disputed governorship poll in which Governor Ganduje was declared winner. He said the gory pictures of violence in Kano publicised in both the social and traditional media during the re-run election were a true reflection of what actually transpired in Kano State during the supplementary election. He voiced confidence that justice would surely prevail over what he called the daylight robbery of the mandate freely given to Abba Kabiru Yusuf by PDP’s teeming supporters.
