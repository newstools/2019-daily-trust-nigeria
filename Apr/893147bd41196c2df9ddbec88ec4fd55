Governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo State has advised the incoming administration not to abandon any of his legacy projects, especially the free education policy of his administration. Okorocha spoke when he received the new manager of Sam Mbakwe International Cargo Airport, Mrs Rejoice Ndudinachi, who paid him a courtesy call at the government house. He also tasked the management to ensure that the airport was totally free from the activities of touts. In her speech earlier, Ndudinachi said she was happy with what she saw at the cargo terminal and promised to work hard to maintain the airport at international standard.
