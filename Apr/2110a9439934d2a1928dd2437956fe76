To address the problems of land administration in the FCT, the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has concluded arrangements to organise a four-day retreat for stakeholders. The Chairman of the Organising Committee of the retreat, who is also the Director of the Abuja Geographic Information Systems (AGIS), Dr. Isa Jalo,  made the disclosure in Abuja on Wednesday. Dr. Jalo said the retreat, which will commence on Thursday, would focus on how to address some grey areas around legal procedures of land use in the FCT. Jalo said the retreat would be organised by the FCT Legal Services Secretariat in conjunction with AGIS and the Department of Land Administration. “It is to highlight and iron out some grey areas as they concern legal issues on land administration in Abuja,’’ he said. He further said departments and agencies, including some security organisations, would brainstorm during the four-day retreat. According to him, among those to participate in the event are the Nigeria Police Force (NPF), Department of State Security (DSS), ICPC and EFCC.
