The Chairman of Abaji Area Council of the FCT, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, has procured two speed boats for riverine communities in the area. Alhaji Ajiya, who took delivery of the speed boats, said they were to ease and facilitate movement of people from the riverine areas to Abaji Metropolis. He said  the speed boats which would soon be handed over to people in Mamagi and Kutara communities would also reduce the challenges residents of the area faced; especially peasant farmers who always found it difficult to transport their crops to the market. He noted that as the rainy season approached, there was the need for the people of the affected communities who always crossed the River Gurara to heave some sigh of relief when travelling to neighbouring villages. He said the council also procured and distributed similar speed boats to Alu/Mamagi and Mawogi communities, which he said had also reduced the transportation problem facing the people of the two communities. “And I can tell you that most of our people, especially those in the riverine communities, had before now been facing challenges of transporting their farm produce to the Abaji Market,  but today, we have brought some sigh of relief to them,” he said. The chairman expressed his administration’s determination to complete all the ongoing projects across the council.
