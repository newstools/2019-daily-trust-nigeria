The presiding judge, Justice B. Tukur, gave the order at the inaugural sitting of the tribunal, yesterday, in Gombe. The petitioners were Muhammad Ibrahim of AGA; Aliyu Adamu of ASD; and Jungudo Muhammad Jungudo of PDC, who are the gubernatorial candidates of their respective parties. Our correspondent reports that all the three petitioners listed the governor-elect of the state, Muhammad Inuwa Yahaya of the All Progressives Congress (APC), as the first respondent. Speaking through their counsel, Barr. Hamman Ghide, the applicants prayed the court to grant them leave to go through the materials to enable them prove their cases before the tribunal.
