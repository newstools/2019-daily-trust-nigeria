‎A group called Advocates for Good Governance (AGG) is currently protesting at the entrance of the National Assembly, demanding the use of open voting in the election of leaders of the incoming 9th Assembly. The protesters numbering hundreds are carrying placards with inscriptions such as “No To Secret Voting in NASS,” “Enough of Secrecy in NASS election,” among others. Leader of the group, Duro Meseko, told journalists they were at the National Assembly to register their displeasure with what he called “planned use of secret voting in electing leaders of 9th Assembly.” “As I’m talking with you now, we are heading inside to submit our petition to the lawmakers in the Senate and House of Representatives,” he said.
