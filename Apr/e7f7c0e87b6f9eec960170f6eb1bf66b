A chieftain of Accord Party in Oyo State, Mr Joseph Abidakun, has urged the state governor-elect, Mr Seyi Makinde, to be wary of political jobbers in appointing his commissioners and other political appointees. Abidakun gave the advice on Monday, in a chat with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ibadan. According to him, expectations of the people from the incoming administration are high, and Makinde should not disappoint them. He said the appointment of credible persons and technocrats who are best hands in their respective fields would enhance the incoming administration’s ability to meet the expectations of the people. ”Makinde should not dance to the tune of political jobbers who are mainly interested in what they would gain instead of service delivery. ”He should search wide to get best hands, not necessarily among his party members, so as to run a government that would function and deliver. ”He should endeavour to fulfil his campaign promises to the people of Oyo State and rule with the fear of God. ”Our incoming governor in collaboration with the state House of Assembly members should formulate policies that would drive economic growth and sustainable development in the state.” Abidakun said. He implored the opposition to stay away from character assassination and other other forms of mudslinging against the incoming administration, but serve as watchdogs through rational criticism.
