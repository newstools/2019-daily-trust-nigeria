Pastor Jibrin Lakutto of ECWA Good News Church Kuje, Abuja has called on Christians to imbibe the culture of sacrifice as demonstrated by Jesus Christ in the spirit of Easter. Lakutto made the call in his Easter message at ECWA Good News Church in Kuje, FCT, on Sunday. According to him, Easter celebration is the greatest feast of the church because without the resurrection of Christ, there would be no hope for Christians. He said the sacrifice by Christ was worthy of emulation, therefore, Christians should follow His footsteps through love, unity, tolerance, forgiveness and sacrifice. “There is hope and Christ showed us there is hope on the cross. He went through suffering and at the end of the day, His resurrection brought us life. “My message is that there is still hope because we know that Christ has risen and is alive so that we may live with Him again. “We must live a sacrificial life just as Jesus Christ laid down His life on the Cross and on the third day He rose again,” he said. The cleric read the Book of Mark Chapter 16: 1-8, to remind Christians of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the significance of Easter celebration by showing love and tolerance. He said Christians must adhere to the commandments of God, while reflecting on the virtues of Christ as they celebrate the Easter. The Sunday service featured drama presentation on the resurrection of Jesus Christ, scriptural reading and song ministrations.
