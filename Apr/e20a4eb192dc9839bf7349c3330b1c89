 The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has acussed the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)’s presidential candidate in the 2019 election, Atiku Abubakar, of manufacturing results of the last presidential election to prove his case at the Presidential Election Petitions Tribunal. Premium Times report that the electoral umpire filed its response on Thursday at the tribunal in Abuja. According to the Online Newspaper, INEC distanced itself from an electronic sheet that purportedly contained the genuine results of the presidential election. INEC said it, “does not share information with such an unclassified entity and any information purportedly derived therefrom which does not accord with the result as declared by INEC is not authentic…” It added that: “INEC specifically denies the existence of electronic transmission of results and it is unknown to the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended).” Atiku’s legal team had submitted the sheet at the tribunal last month, contending it was obtained from an internal compilation of results on INEC’s Internet server. The team, amongst other submissions, said Atiku won by more than six million votes, but his victory was allegedly suppressed by the commission in favour of incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari.
