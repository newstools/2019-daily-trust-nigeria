The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) on Tuesday blasted the federal government over proposed plan to establish a private university to be named after President Muhammadu Buhari. The Union described the proposed university by the wife of the president, Mrs Aisha Buhari as a disaster. ASUU further said the plan of the wife of the President to establish a new university confirmed why her Husband continued to reduce budgetary allocation to education since he assumed office in 2015. The Chairman of the union, University of Ibadan chapter, Professor Deji Omole and a former National Treasurer of the Union, Professor Ademola Aremu Stated this in a separate interview with newsmen in Ibadan. It would be recalled that the Wife of the President, Mrs Aisha Buhari had over the weekend at a Town hall meeting in Yola announced her plan to establish a private university to be named after President Buhari. Omole said: “When I heard about the proposed private university to be named after Mr President, I just looked at it as a joke taken too far. If we have a president in a country that has simply refused to fund public education and all we get from the first family is to establish a private university in collaboration with some foreigners, it is a disaster for this country and for a sitting president. “The implication is that Nigerians should know that this leadership does not believe in public funded education”.
