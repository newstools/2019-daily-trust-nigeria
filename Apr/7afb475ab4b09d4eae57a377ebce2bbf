Osun State Governor Gboyega Oyetola has urged Nigerians to eschew ‎things that can affect the nation’s peaceful coexistence. According to him, it is high time Nigerians, irrespective of socio-economic, religious, political and ethnic differences,  rose against insurgency. He spoke weekend as chairman at the 25th Annual Pre-Ramadan Lecture of the University of Lagos Muslim Alumni. He condemned insurgency in parts of the country and called on Nigerians to see the nation’s diversity as a blessing for national unity, peace and integration. He said: “Unfortunately, we engage in the negativity of intolerance in diversity, hence we have xenophobia, ethnic and religious chauvinism, which is often wrapped around religion to justify these evil and un-Islamic positions.” Oyetola described Islam as an antithesis to violence and insurgency, asking the perpetrators to embrace peace in the interest of the country. The governor also called on government at all levels to evolve policies that would strengthen unity in diversity. “Hate and extremism, therefore, is not intrinsic to Islam and was never a part of our spiritual DNA, if we are to promote diversity, we must chain this beast called extremism. “In Nigeria, thousands have lost their lives to mindless nihilistic violence perpetrated by Boko Haram, who are simple bandits parading themselves to be Muslims.
