Government House Photographer, Mr. Reginald Dei and Peoples Democratic Party Ward Chairman for Oweikorogha, Mr. Seidougha Taribi, who were killed by soldiers during the last elections were buried on Friday amidst tears. They were killed in Southern Ijaw local government area of the state during the presidential and National Assembly elections last month. Speaking during a meeting with political appointees in Yenagoa, Governor Seriake Dickson accused the leadership of the nation’s security agencies of deliberately shielding the perpetrators of the heinous acts from justice. He lamented that the masterminds of the violence and killings during the election, while some leaders of the All Progressive Congress, APC, in Bayelsa state, were being given cover by security agencies who have failed to arrest them for prosecution. He said: “These two young men were cut down in their prime for no reason. The criminals responsible for this heinous crime are being guarded by security agencies. It is indeed another sad reminder of the things they do to us as a state.” Democracy’s sore fingers 18 NEW Victims of Bayelsa election violence recount ordeal
