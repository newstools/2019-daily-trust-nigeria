Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike yesterday vowed that his administration would take the fight to cultists in the state. He spoke at the Government House, Port Harcourt on Monday when the state Council of Traditional Rulers paid him a congratulatory visit on his re-election. He said: “We will not allow these cultists who want to paint the state black continue  to cause mayhem. We will take the fight to them. Enough is enough.  These people cannot continue  to kill our people.” Wike said he had met with the State Security Council Sunday night where modalities had been worked out to rid the state of cult-related killings. He urged the royal fathers to support his government in the fight against cultism, saying that prompt information would be useful  in tracking down the criminal elements. The governor expressed displeasure that some of the traditional rulers were involved in party politics despite  his advice against.
