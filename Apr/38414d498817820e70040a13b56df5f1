The Chairman of the FCT chapter of the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA), Dr. Ekpe Philips Uche, says the association has rendered free medical treatments to patients in various communities in Kwali Area Council. Uche stated this while speaking with newsmen in Abuja, yesterday. He said the gesture was part of the association’s corporate social responsibility. He said members of the association were currently assisting patients at Dabi and Bako communities in Kwali Area Council, adding that the association would offer same at primary healthcare centres in Karshi and Jikwoyi. He said the measures would create room for government hospitals to be visited two to three times a week thereby reducing cases of late referrals. Uche said the association’s executives had a three-point agenda – patients’ centres, welfare, as well as doctors welfare – which he said the association was making efforts to sustain. “Besides, under the patients’ centre, we are disseminating information through our members to the public on health issues and also partnering with an organization where patients have free access to doctors and advocacies,” he said.  300 doctors left Nigeria in 2016-NMA President Four Kwali clinic projects abandoned At Damakusa health centre, staff, patients defecate in bush
