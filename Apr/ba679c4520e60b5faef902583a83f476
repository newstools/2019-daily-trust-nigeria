A 55-year-old man, Rotimi Vaughan, who is afflicted with stroke, wasyesterday docked before an Igbosere, Lagos, chief magistrate court for allegedly stealing N9.6 million. When the case was called up, Vaughan could hardly move into the dock and had to be offered a seat while the proceedings lasted. The police alleged that the defendant committed the offence in 2016 at the Fadeyi Shomolu area of Lagos when he obtained the N9.6m sum from one Mrs Olufunke Ogunfuye on the pretext he would be procuring visas and flight tickets for a number of her clients to travel to South Carolina, USA, to attend the Onotunji festival. He was said to have, however, converted the said money to his own use and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 314 (1) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015. Vaughan informed the court that the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS) granted him administrative bail in 2018 on the condition he would be making payments to Mrs Ogunfuye after an out-of-court settlement. But the police said the defendant jumped the bail and defaulted, hence the FSARS invited him again. It was gathered that he fainted when he got to the FSARS office and was again granted bail before he was arraigned yesterday. Chief Magistrate B. I. Bakare admitted him N1m bail, with two sureties. The court also ordered prison officials to avail the suspect adequate medical attention and allow him take his medications. The magistrate adjourned further hearing on the case till May 2, 2019.
