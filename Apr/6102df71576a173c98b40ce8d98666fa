Five suspects arrested for alleged involvement in the bank robbery which claimed seven lives at Ido-Ani, Akoko, Ondo State, two weeks ago have been remanded in the Olokuta prison custody. Six accused persons  –  Isah Yusuf, 27; Joshua Egumah, 27; Idris Alli Abdullahi, 32; Philip Scheme, 26; Odeh Friday, 27; and Peter Ofomadu –  were charged before a chief magistrate court sitting in Akure, the Ondo State capital yesterday, on a seven-count charge. Only five of the six persons were, however, brought to the court yesterday as the sixth person was said to be at large. Chief magistrate Victoria Bob-Manuel, after listening to the arguments of both the prosecuting and defence counsels, remanded the suspects at the Olokuta prison. The case was adjourned till May 2, 2019 pending advice from the office of the Ondo State Director of Public Prosecution. The Ondo State police spokesman, Femi Joseph, told Daily Trust the police wanted the accused men remanded in prison custody to avoid them tampering with police investigations.
