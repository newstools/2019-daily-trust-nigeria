The ruling APC has dismissed the PDP allegation that the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami (SAN), Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi and other party bigwigs were prevailing on the Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Tanko Mohammed, to reverse the judgement which stopped APC from fielding candidates for the 2019 general elections, especially in Rivers State. APC, which reacted, yesterday, through its National Publicity Secretary, Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, said instead the PDP was intimidating Supreme Court justices on the matter of purported exclusion of Rivers State APC candidates. Issa-Onilu condemned what he described as the PDP ‘nonsensical statement’ to deceive the public and blackmail eminent Supreme Court justices into doing their bidding in respect of the matter of the purported exclusion of Rivers State APC candidates from the last elections before the apex court. He said the ‘cheap attempt’ by the PDP to ambush the Supreme Court with their ‘cock and bull conspiracies’ should be seen as ‘hogwash’. APC, which urged Nigerians to ignore what it called the evil machinations of the PDP as contained in their ‘ludicrous and false statement’, said the PDP as a party had refused to come to terms with the fact that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led APC administration is a stickler to the rule of law. “Again, for the purpose of clarity, it needs restating that the Supreme Court has not made any pronouncement on the purported exclusion of APC candidates from the just concluded governorship, national assembly and state assembly elections in Rivers State. “As always, we shall allow the law take its course in respect of the purported exclusion of our candidates in the elections in Rivers State and we advise the PDP to do the same, rather than overheat the polity with their illogical and false claims,” he added.
