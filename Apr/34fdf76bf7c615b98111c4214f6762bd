A ground breaking ceremony of a dialysis center was held yesterday at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) to cater for over 20 million Lagos residents. The center will be built in honour of a former Lions Club District Governor, Late Isaac Olusola Dada, who died at the International Airport in Lagos  in 2017. Speaking at the ceremony,  LUTH Chief Medical Director, Prof Christopher Bode, said the few dialysis centers in Lagos State are not sufficient enough to manage the kidney problems of millions of people living in the state. He said that LUTH, as a federal government hospital has no dialysis center of its own at the moment. “LUTH once had a renal dialysis center which catered for over 600 people in a month. It ran down and could not continue,” he said He insisted that the new center which will be built by Lions Club International, will survive as it will be run under a public private partnership adding that the partners are ready with the dialysis machine, all they are waiting for is the building. Bode however, urged the Club to build more of such center in Nigeria. In addition, the wife of Late Dr Olusola Dada, Mrs Omolola hinted that the 36-bed centre, will be completed within six months to one year. While appealing for fund to build the kidney treatment center from members of the Lions Club, she disclosed that the International body of the Club has disbursed $100,000 for the project, which she insisted would not be sufficient to complete the multi-million naira edifice. It was revealed that Late Dada before his death, had vowed to build a dialysis centre in LUTH as his legacy in Rotary. He was said to have gone to the United States in 2017 to enquire about the dialysis machines for the center but died on his way back to Nigeria at the Lagos Airport.
