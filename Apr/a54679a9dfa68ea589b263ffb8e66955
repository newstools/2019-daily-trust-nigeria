A middle aged man, named Hassan has explained how he regained his freedom after being abducted along Birnin-Gwari-Kaduna highway last week Friday. He said the incident happened around 5pm when the vehicle he was travelling in with five other traders was attacked by the Armed bandits, closed to Buruku- Udawa village along the highway, after returning from a local market. Hassan told Daily Trust that he was allowed to go home after his abductors discovered he had no phone to contact any of his family members for ransom. He however, said the bandits collected N120,000 from him. “We were on our way back home from a local market in Buruku when the bandits opened fire on the vehicle we were travelling in and luckily, non of the passengers was hit or injured. “They collected the money in my possession and took us into the bush to their camp inside the forest. I think we trekked for almost 3 kilometres before we got to their camp. They kept us there for days but because I had no phone ‎with me, they decided to let me go since I was of no use to them because they cannot contact my people for ransom,” he said. Hassan also said during the few days spent in their custody, they were starved by the 8-man Armed bandit gang as they denied them food and water. “At a point, they stopped giving us food and water because, to them, we were not there to be fed free of charged. Sometimes, they will give us water to drink. In fact, they were taking us along to their operations in the night since they can’t leave us alone in the bush,” he said. Hassan said one other victim was released because they collected N450,000 with him the very day of the attack. He appealed to the state government to intensify effort to curtail kidnapping and other forms of criminality along that route.
