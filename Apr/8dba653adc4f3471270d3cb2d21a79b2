The Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) has donated relief materials to the Ogun State Emergency Management Agency (OGUN SEMA) for onward distribution to the victims of the July 13, 2018 flood disaster which occurred in Abeokuta, the state capital. Items donated included foodstuffs, sewing machines and toiletries. The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of the Environment, Mrs Yetunde Dina, while receiving the materials on behalf of the state government at the Trade Fair Complex in Abeokuta, expressed concern over the disaster, even as she implored residents to desist from dumping refuse in the river course as that could pose a serious threat to the environment. “NIMASA has done well to consider Ogun State as one of those to benefit from disaster relief materials. But we are asking for more to assist the destitute, too,” Dina said. The Director, NIMASA, Western Zone, Olayemi Abass, explained that the donation was part of the corporate social responsibilities of the agency to help cushion the effects of the flood disaster. Abass disclosed that the agency had in recent times organized similar social interventions in 20 states of the country, adding that it was necessary for government agencies to collaborate on emergency management and other related issues for the benefit of the entire citizenry. The Director, OGUN SEMA, Olufolarin Ige, also thanked NIMASA for its support and pledged that the materials would be distributed to the affected people accordingly.
