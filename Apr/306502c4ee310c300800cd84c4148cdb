Foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi made the comments on Sunday. Already tense relations between the two deteriorated this year when Pakistan-based militants killed dozens of Indian troops in Indian-administered Kashmir. India responded with air strikes on what it said was a militant training camp in Pakistani territory.

Both nuclear-armed nations claim all of Muslim-majority Kashmir, but only control parts of it.
