Ahead of July, 2019, PDP state congress in Kogi State, an aspirant for the chairmanship, Mr. Fidelis Alfa, has expressed determination to reposition the party for victory in the November governorship election in the state, and beyond. Mr. Alfa noted that the problem with PDP in the state was that of leadership, adding that the party “presently lacks discipline, transparency and what it takes to reconcile aggrieved members.” According to him, “As it is now, it looks as if there is no PDP in the state. If elected, I will ensure that the party is back to life as the people’s hope generally lies on the party. I will also run a party that can be self-reliant, focused and proactive in its activities.” National Chairmanship: PDP needs a gentleman with ideas – Adeniran PDP chair: I am the most qualified candidate – Secondus The antics of opposition in Kogi
