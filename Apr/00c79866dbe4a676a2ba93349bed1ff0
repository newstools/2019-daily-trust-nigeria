Ogun state governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, on Tuesday explained why he labelled people “no brainer”, an abusive language, reportedly common in the state’s corridor of power. Amosun hinted that he usually deploys the language each time anybody does things that defy “logical reasoning.” The governor, who was responding to questions at a press conference today, ahead of African Drum Festival in the state, argued that “education does not mean reasonableness.” Amosun also lampooned those criticising his government’s programmes and policies. “Government is a serious business. You must have brain to do the job. That’s why I say ‘no brain.’ “Yes, I will say no brain when you’re doing something that defies logical reasoning. How? You went to school, travel around the world, see the way things are being done but it’s difficult for you to replicate here,” he said. The governor reiterated his commitment to complete ongoing projects by “working to the last second of my administration.” Inside Amosun, Oshiomhole’s endless verbal war What I will do to Amosun — Ogun governor-elect Abiodun Amosun, APM chair meet Buhari, present adoption letter
