Sri Lanka has revised down the death toll from Sunday’s blasts by more than 100, to “about 253”, the health ministry says. It has blamed a calculation error. Suicide bombers struck hotels and churches in the Colombo and the city of Batticaloa. Hundreds were injured. Most of those killed were Sri Lankans, but dozens of foreigners were also casualties. Nine people are suspected of carrying out the attacks. Police have continued carrying out raids and have issued photographs of seven people wanted in connection with the attacks. The authorities blamed a local Islamist extremist group, National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ), soon after the blasts but say the bombers must have had outside help. The Islamic State group said it was behind the attacks and published a video showing eight men but provided no evidence of direct involvement.
