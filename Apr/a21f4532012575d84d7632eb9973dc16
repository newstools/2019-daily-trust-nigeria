The FCT Administration has called on residents to become vaccine heroes who will ensure that eligible persons get vaccinated on time. Malam Abubakar Adamu Bappah, Secretary, Health and Human Services Secretariat, made the call in his address at the commencement of the 9th African Vaccination Week with theme ‘Protected Together, Vaccines Work’. He said vaccine heroes could also talk to people about the benefits of vaccine which save lives and help children learn, grow and prevent serious illnesses and disability. He said the week, set aside by the United Nations member states in the African region, would be celebrated from April 22-30. Bappah also said as at March 2019, Penta 3 coverage for FCT stood at 90.5% while measles was at 81.2%. He added that the FCT has achieved 96.6% coverage on the yellow fever mass vaccination campaign to attain the first position among the six participating states. The secretary said as part of the campaign, continuous community sensitisation and mobilisation would be done as well as integrated service delivery using health camps at designated sites including Kabusa, Wusa, Gongola and new Kuchigoro and IDP camps.
