The army will today commence  an internal security-based exercise codenamed “Ex Harbin Kunama IV”. This, according to the army, is to flush out armed bandits and insurgent groups from identified forest areas and strongholds in Katsina, Sokoto and Zamfara States. The deputy director of the Army Public Relations, Major Clement Abiade, made this known in a statement released to journalists in Sokoto. He said the exercise was scheduled to hold from 1 April to 30 June 2019. “Furthermore, the exercise is to bolster the confidence of the people of the region to go about their daily lives unhindered under the security umbrella of the Nigerian Army and other security agencies,” he stated. Abiade asked members of the public not to panic on noticing increased movement of troops, armoured vehicles, equipment and sound of firing in designated exercise/operations area. He assured that necessary control measures had been put  in place to ensure that no one comes to harm as a result of the exercise.
