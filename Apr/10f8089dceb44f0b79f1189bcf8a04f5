The FCT minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, has called on the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) to ensure they imposed harsh penalty for drivers who violate traffic rules and regulations. Bello, represented by his chief of staff, Mohammed Bashir, also urged the FRSC to emphasise public enlightenment and enforcement of monetary penalties on such erring drivers to serve as deterrent to other road abusers. The minister, who was speaking during the commissioning of 73 FRSC operational vehicles, which included ambulances in Abuja at the weekend, said it was the responsibility of every individual, corporate entity and agency of government to work collectively for the improvement of safety on the roads. He stressed the need for road users to support and collaborate with the FRSC in order to internalise safer road culture in the FCT and other parts of the country. He commended the FRSC over its regular road patrol initiatives which, he said, are aimed at checking cases of dangerous driving and traffic rules violations as well as abuse of traffic lights in the city. The Corps Marshal of FRSC, Boboye Oyeyemi, expressed appreciation to the FCT minister and the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) Boss Mustapha, for opening their doors for collaboration with the FRSC to provide additional vehicles. He said the additional vehicles would assist the commission in discharging its duties diligently across the territory.
