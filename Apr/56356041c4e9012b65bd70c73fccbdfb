The Emir of Katsina, Alhaji Abdulmumini Kabir, has tasked parents to monitor their children to know the type of friends they move around with. Kabir gave the advice during the opening of the Annual Muslim Ramadan Fasting jointly organised by Al-Qalam University, NTA Katsina, Companion FM and Walin Hausa Foundation on Monday in Katsina. ”As a royal father, I hereby advice all parents to quickly start monitoring their children in order to guard against mixing with bad friends. ”Parents should evolve a mechanism that will assist them to know the kind of persons their children mix with to avoid their becoming miscreants. ”On many occasions, many children become drug addicts, prostitutes, thieves and other hardened criminals due to the influence of friends,” he said. The emir who was represented by a retired judge, Khadi Sule Sada, said that the Katsina Emirate Council would continue to preach for peaceful co-existence and fight drug addiction. Earlier, the Chairman of Walin Hausa Foundation, Justice Umar Abdullahi, called on youths to embrace all the good teachings of Islam. Abdullahi who was the former National President of Court of Appeal, Abuja, pledged his continued support to Islamic programmes, so as to sensitise Muslims on their responsibilities.
