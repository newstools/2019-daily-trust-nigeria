Family members of Takum based businessman, Alhaji Mayo have expressed concerns over the refusal of abductors to release the business man after collecting N100 million. The spokesperson of the abducted businessmanâ€™s family, Mallam Ibrahim Takum told Daily Trust that Alhaji Mayo was abducted forty days ago in Takum and the abductors demanded N100 million which was paid but they refused to release him. According to him, the abductors, after collecting N100million, further demanded additional N100 million. He said after series of negotiation between family members of the businessman over the demand of additional ransom, to their dismay, the abductors have stopped further communication. He said family and friends of the businessman were now in confusion over the fate of the victim because it was not certain if the businessman was still alive. Mallam Ibrahim expressed fears over the fate of the businessman, adding that their fears was because of what happened to a member of Taraba House of Assembly Mr Hosea Ibbi, who was abducted in December 2018 but got killed after his family paid N28 million ransom. According to him, the abduction of the businessman was beyond mere kidnapping, adding that there could be other motives behind the abduction.
