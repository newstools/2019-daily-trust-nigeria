The North Central Elders Forum (NCEF) has warned of a repeat of the 2015 rebellion in the ranks of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) federal lawmakers over the zoning of the National Assembly leadership. The NCEF Chairman, Alhaji Muhammadu Ari Gwaska, in company of other leaders of the zone, urged President Muhammadu Buhari and the APC to zone the position of Speaker of the 9th House of Representatives to the North Central. According to Gwaska, APC should imbibe the tradition of party democracy which appropriates the spoils of office when elections are contested and won for the purpose of running an inclusive government and to accommodate divergent interests within the party. He said the North Central was too strategic to be relegated in the sharing of power in the National Assembly and Nigeria as a nation. He queried the insinuations that the South West was being considered by the APC leadership for the Speaker which, he said, would be unfair to the North Central. “The North Central deserves the nation’s number four position based on the number of votes it contributed to the reelection of President Buhari during the last presidential and National Assembly elections. “The NCEF believes in the ability, maturity and the exposure of the deputy House Leader, Hon. Ahmed Idris Wase, representing Wase Federal Constituency of Plateau State to be the Speaker of the 9th House of Representatives to be inaugurated in June 2019,” he said. He said Wase has the support of the elders of the zone as he has garnered enough legislative experience in the House which will make him to relate very well with the executive arm of government headed by President Buhari to move Nigeria forward, give accelerated development to Nigeria and the deserved dividends of democracy to Nigerians.
