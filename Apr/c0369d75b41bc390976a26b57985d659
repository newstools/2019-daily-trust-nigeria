The Kano State Governorship, National Assembly and House of Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal has fixed May 6, 2019, for the commencement of hearing on the petition filed before it against Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje and the APC by the PDP and its gubernatorial candidate. Barr. Bashir Yusuf Muhammad, who is Counsel to PDP and its candidate, Abba Kabiru Yusuf, told Daily Trust that they had filed two pending applications but struck out one based on a latest development, adding that the counsel had respected the court’s opinion on their second application. “We have two pending applications before the court. One seeking the order to serve the APC and the Kano State governor by substituted means because all effort to serve him through personal service proved abortive as stated to us by the registry. “However, we learnt today that the registry was yesterday able to serve the governor personally and subsequently we apply for the court to strikeout the application; which the court did,” he said. “The second application was to ask the court to extend the ex parte order given to us to inspect election materials with INEC because the order given to us elapsed after 14 days from the day it was given to us and the court was of the opinion that since the petition was served on all parties, it is better for us to put them on notice so that they could come to the court and order will be given to them to act accordingly,” the counsel explained. Similarly, Counsel to APC and Gov. Ganduje, Musa Abdullahi Lawal, stated that the court’s decision was fair, saying all must be placed on notice so that the court would hear from them. The presiding judge, Justice Halima Shamaki, adjourned the case to May 6 for hearing.
