A political group, Dr. Hajo Sani Youth Network for Buhari Continuity (DHSYNBC), yesterday, said it believes President Muhammadu Buhari will do better during his second term in office. The group, in a statement jointly signed by its National Coordinator, Salisu Bala Hassan, and Secretary, Nwafor Odochukwu, said Buhari won because Nigerians trusted him. The group said the massive support across the nation that the president got during the last election would serve as a morale booster for him to take the country to greater heights. It, therefore, promised that all its activities would be geared towards supporting Buhari in order to help him kill corruption and deliver good and quality governance.
