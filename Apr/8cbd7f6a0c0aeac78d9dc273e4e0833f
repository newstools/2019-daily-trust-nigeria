The Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) has commenced a 14-day skill acquisition training programme for 28 physically challenged persons in Edo. The coordinator of the programme in the state, Theresa Patrison, said the programme was organised by NDDC in collaboration with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to enable people living with disabilities with various skills to acquire necessary skills for self-employment and earn a living. She explained that the programme was also to enhance Micro Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (MSME) with its main objective been to strengthen the economies of the Niger Delta states. She said the training will help the beneficiaries become job creators instead of job seekers as they will learn how to manage their businesses properly. Patrison said participants would be provided with starter packs in line with their skills. â€œThe participants would be trained in bead making, photography, wig making, shoe and bag making, head tie(auto gele), manicure and pedicure, makeup and GSM repairs among others.
