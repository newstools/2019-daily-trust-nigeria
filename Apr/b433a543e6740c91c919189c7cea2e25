River Plate Park Abuja was a beehive of activities last Saturday as over 80 Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) displayed their wares at the second edition of the SMEs Springboard fair. One of the participants and CEO of Handicraft, Mrs Hamsatu Aliyu Afegbua, said the fair gave them opportunities to sell and meet new customers. “I am happy to be at the SMEs Springboard trade fair today.  It’s actually a good thing for us as it gives us opportunities to network and meet other vendors and customers. Today, some are buying and some new customers have placed orders and have made payment already upfront,” she said. One of the shoppers, Nnenna Isoha, said products at the fair were cheaper than in the shops. “The fair is going well. I was able to get a few things for my kids like shoes and trousers. I got some trousers for N2000. Ordinarily it will go for N7500 in the shops. I got shoes for N3000, these are things they sell for N8000, and there are varieties. So, I bought a lot for them. New quality things, not old stock,” she said. The organiser of the fair, Mrs Helen Asimegbe, said this was the second edition of the SMEs Springboard fair. “We started this for SMEs who are starting-up and looking for avenues to showcase their businesses. We started by holding sessions with SMEs on how to increase sales, to get their businesses structured. But then, we thought of moving it to the market space, so last year we began this fair. “This year’s event is much better. We have seen a lot more people. We have more vendors; we have over 80 vendors here today,” Asimegbe said. MTel provided free Wifi for shoppers while NISA Premier Hospital provided free medical check-up for people at the fair.
