A civil rights group has called on Nigerians to resist the illegal conspiracy to remove the Kogi State Chief Judge and warned the plotters to be prepared for the consequences of undermining the judiciary. Coalition in Defence of Nigerian Democracy and Constitution (CDNDC) in a statement by its convener, Ariyo-Dare Atoye, described the alleged executive-induced plot to remove the state chief judge, Justice Nasir Ajanah, as “an evil agenda to subjugate the judiciary and finally enslave the good people of Kogi State.” “We must do everything lawful and democratic to prevent the budding tyrant in Kogi from subverting the judiciary, and we must rise in defence of Justice Ajana, the state chief judge,” the statement read. CDNDC also condemned the state’s House of Assembly for allegedly conniving with the governor to execute what it called a “devious plot.
