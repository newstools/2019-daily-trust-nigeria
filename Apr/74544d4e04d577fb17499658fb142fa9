Ahead of the Easter celebrations, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has beefed up security in all its airports across the country. This is usually the practice ahead of the festive period where the airports would witness upsurge of passengers connecting one city to the others to celebrate with their families and loved ones. General Manager, Public Affairs of FAAN, Mrs. Henrietta Yakubu said as the Easter holiday approaches, the network of airports under the management of FAAN “are fully prepared and ready for the usual upsurge in passenger traffic that is the norm around this season”. She explained that that all necessary facilities, infrastructure and manpower to ensure seamless facilitation at the airports have been deployed. She assured passengers of safety and security, saying relevant security agencies have been mobilized to beef up security at all airports. The Authority advised passengers to endeavour to leave for the airport early enough, so as to ensure that check in formalities are conducted in good time. Similarly the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) Command of the Nigeria Police Force said it had deployed personnel at the nooks and crannies of the airport to forestall any untoward activity at the nation’s busiest gateway. Spokesman of the command, DSP Joseph Alabi said the Commissioner of Police Joseph Mukan had equally taken steps to fight touting at the airports, saying the problem has been reduced drastically. “I can tell you the airport in Lagos is very safe. Our officers and men are up and doing. They have been deployed at strategic locations to provide security for all passengers and airport users”, he said.
