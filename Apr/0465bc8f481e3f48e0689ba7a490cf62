A yet to be identified middle aged driver escaped death after a bus he was driving summersaulted at Sabon Lugbe, on Airport Road, Abuja. A witness who spoke with our reporter at the scene said the crash happened at about 11am when the back tyre of the bus pulled off. A commercial cyclist, Usman Bala, said the bus which was loaded with goods overturned immediately the back tyre pulled off. He added that the driver came out of the upturned bus unscathed. “In fact, this is where I was standing when the bus started to summersault until it landed on the pedestrian lane. Luckily enough, however, the driver who was alone in the bus came out without a scratched,” he said. Our reporter observed that men of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) arrived the scene with their patrol van along with the police patrol team to assist in evaluating the goods out of the bus. An FRSC official who said he was not permitted to talk to the press attributed the accident to overloading, which he said, resulted to tyre burst. 15 passengers burnt near Abaji 8 burnt to death as bus catches fire on Abuja-Lokoja road Passenger dies as bus rams into truck in Abaji
