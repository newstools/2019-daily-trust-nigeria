A Chieftain of the APC in Kano, Alhaji Abdulmajid Danbilki Commander, has said the northern part of the country will not allow itself to be used as a launch pad for waging a propaganda war by the party’s National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahamed Tinubu, in the wake of the current struggle for the leadership of the National Assembly. Commander, in a press statement he signed, said the APC being the ruling party in the country was almost on the precipice as a result of “Tinubu’s crafty design to stamp his imprimatur against the wish of prominent card-carrying members of the party who have different perceptions of how the NASS leadership should be formed.” He pointed out that the issue of reaching a consensus on the NASS leadership was just a figment of Tinubu and Oshiomhole’s propaganda stunt for them to score a cheap political point.
