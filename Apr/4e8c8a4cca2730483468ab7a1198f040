The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) has completed and energised the first phase of the transmission substation in Ekim, Akwa Ibom State. The spokesperson of TCN, Mrs. Ndidi Mbah, said this phase consisted of a 60MVA 132/33kV power transformer and three outgoing 33kV feeder bays and that the transformer was energised early in April and had been operational since then. TCN said although the first phase had been completed and energised, the 2x60MVA capacity substation would be completed with the installation of another 60MVA transformer and three feeder bays. The Ekim Transmission Substation project is being executed in collaboration with the Akwa Ibom State Government. While TCN provides and installs the transformers, switchgears and gantries using its in-house engineers, the Akwa Ibom State Government is providing all the civil works associated with the execution of the project. Having energised the first phase of the project, TCN noted that it now had available, additional 48MW of bulk power supply for PHEDC to offtake through the three feeders to its customers such as the Akwa Ibon State University, Coconut Oil Refinery and Meter Manufacturin.
