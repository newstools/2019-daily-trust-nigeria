A socio-political group within the Oyo State chapter of the APC, under the banner of Oyo APC Reformers, has attributed the failure of the party in the last general elections to the apolitical nature of some of the people currently appointed into federal positions from the state. The group, in a statement signed by its state secretary, Alhaji Sulaimon Ramon, said those representing the party through appointment in the state were not giving back to the masses as expected. It said they didn’t take part in the last electioneering campaigns in the state. The group advised the party at the national level to reconsider the federal appointments to reinvigorate APC in Oyo State and reclaim power in 2023. The statement, issued after its monthly meeting in Ibadan, read “Out of the nine federal special assistants appointed from the state, none of them is a known member of the party or took part in the electioneering process for President Buhari in the state. “The APC Reformers believes that if appointments were properly made and spread across the political zones in the state, the story of Oyo APC may have been different today.” Gombe APC crisis defies solution, as party gets c’taker chair Oyo 2019: A clash of gladiators Troubled diplomacy: When states’ APC rejected ambassadorial nominees
