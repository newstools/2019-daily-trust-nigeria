The Federal government has been advised to set up a special task force to mop up arms in the hands of people in Taraba and Benue states. The call was made by a prominent member of Wukari community, Mr John Bulus in an interview with Daily Trust. He said rampant cases of communal and religious crisis and kidnapping will only be addressed if sophisticated arms in the hands of many people in the state and neighbouring states were mopped up. Mr Bulus said militia from both sides in the ongoing Jukun-Tiv conflict have brandished sophisticated arms, including rocket launchers while residents in both sides have many arms in their possession. He said a mere misunderstanding will result in people rushing into their houses to bring out sophisticated arms and start killing one another. He said it was very dangerous to allow civilians to have such arms, adding that stock piling of arms in South Taraba, central and sea part of Northern Taraba as well as in border areas between the state and Benue had been going on for many years. Mr Bulus warned that it was very alarming to allow civilians including criminal elements to have so much sophisticated arms like the situation at hand in Taraba state. He said unless the Federal government through its security agencies started recovering arms illegally acquired, the state would never see peace.
