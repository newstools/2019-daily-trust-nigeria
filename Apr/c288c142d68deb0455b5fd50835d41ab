The host community of the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria yesterday urged the Federal Ministry of Science and Technology to ensure fairness in the appointment of substantive Director General for the Nigerian Institute of Leather and Science Technology (NALEST), Zaria. Secretary of the Samaru Community, Hassan Usman, made this call, saying that the community is suspecting foul play in the process of selecting the new DG, hence the need to call the attention of the ministry, as well as the presidency. Usman said after an advertisement announcing the availability of the vacant position, many candidates applied. He added: “To our utmost surprise however, selection interview has been fixed for 15th and 16th of April, 2019 without a list of the shortlisted candidates. Some of these candidates are among the best brains in ABU. We contacted them and they told us that they were not even aware that a selection interview has been fixed. This is why we are suspecting foul play. “We are therefore calling on the ministry, particularly the presidency, to follow up on this to ensure fairness to all. The Buhari administration has been preaching transparency, therefore important appointments like this should follow due process and at the end the best candidate should emerge. “Samaru community feels that the era of impunity should be over by now. Both ABU and NALEST are situated in our community and anything that may affect peaceful coexistence in these institutions may have negative effect on our community.” Usman said the community would take all necessary measures within the law to ensure that what happened in a similar Zaria institute under the ministry, where a Director General was appointed in absolute violation of due process, did not repeat itself.
