The Defence Headquarters (DHQ) has said troops of Operation Whirl Stroke, deployed to counter banditary activities in North Central Nigeria, have rescued three kidnapped victims in a building located at Gana’s family compound at Gbise in Katsina Ala Local Government Area of Benue State. A statement from Defence spokesman Colonel Onyema Nwachukwu said the victims, a man and two women, were rescued during a dawn raid in the early hours of Friday 26 April 2019, when troops stormed a building reportedly belonging to a notorious bandits’ leader, Gana. He said the visibly traumatized victims claimed they were abducted about two months ago at Gboko by a gang of kidnappers and subsequently relocated to Gbise community. He said troops were still on the trail of the criminals, who fled their enclave after they were overpowered in a shootout with the troops. He said troops have also destroyed the building, which served as the kidnappers’ hideout. Nwachukwu said the rescued persons have been handed over to authorities of Benue State Government for medical attention before reuniting them with their respective families. He also said troops of Operation Whirl Stroke, deployed to Giza in Nasarawa State, have arrested a bandit during a raid on a suspected bandits’ hideout at Alima, near Kadarko in Nasarawa State. He said the bandit, who was intercepted with a locally made rifle and some quantity of gun powder, is currently assisting in preliminary investigations after which he will be handed over to an appropriate prosecuting security agency.
