Boko Haram insurgents, on Monday, attacked Kuda-Kaya village in Madagali Local Government Area in Adamawa State, killing 26 persons. Witness accounts indicated that dozens of armed militants invaded the village at around 6 pm on five trucks and several motorcycles. A resident, Danladi Sine said the attackers took residents by surprise and fired randomly at fleeing residents while setting houses on fire. “They were many, they came in five vehicles and several motorcycles and attacked when people were attending a wedding. I saw 26 corpses”, he stated. This is one of several attacks carried out by the insurgents in the area since January, as more people abandoned their villages to seek refuge in towns for fear of continued attacks. Community leaders have repeatedly complained that soldiers were stationed im towns, calling on the federal government to deploy soldiers to the surrounding villages, especially those along the known routes of Boko Haram. Authorities at the 28 Task Brigade with headquarters in Chibok could not be reached for comment. However, the Police Public Relations Officer in Adamawa, Othman Abubakar confirmed the attack, saying although it involved loss of lives, he hadn’t receive the casualty figure yet.
