The National Pension Commission (PenCom) has said that the Micro Pension Plan (MPP) which was launched by President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja two weeks ago is targeting over 30 million self-employed Nigerians to ensure their inclusion in it by 2024. The Head, Corporate Communication of PenCom, Mr. Peter Aghahowa, made this known while briefing newsmen at the PenCom Stand at the ongoing Enugu International Trade Fair, holding at its permanent site, Enugu-Abakaliki Highway, Enugu. Aghahowa explained that the MPP which, he described as an initiative of PenCom, was aimed at the provision of pension services to self-employed persons in the informal sector and employees of organisations with less than three staff. He said the informal sector constituted an estimated 69 million workforce in the country and represented an estimated 88 per cent of Nigerian workers who lacked pensions and safety nets for their old age. He emphasised that the main goal of the commission is to achieve coverage of 30 million people in the informal sector by 2024. Aghahowa, who was represented at the occasion by the Assistant General Manager, Corporate Communication, recalled that the formal launch was the official flag-off of the plan which attested to the objective of the current administration to provide ample opportunities for financial inclusion and economic stability for more Nigerians in the informal sector.
