A historian and socialist from Obafemi Awolowo University, Ife, Dr. Olusegun Osoba, said the agitation for restructuring by some ruling elites was a “blatant lie”. Osoba said restructuring as being proposed by some ruling elite had to do with creation of states to create a platform for the continued looting of the treasury. He said most of the proponents did not clearly define what they meant by restructuring but their body language indicated that they were after state creation. Osoba spoke in Lagos yesterday during the presentation of the Minority Report and Draft Constitution for the Federal Republic of Nigeria by the Centre for Democratic Development Research and Training (CEDDERT), Zaria. A former governor of old Kaduna State,  Balarabe Musa; the  president of the Nigeria Labour Congress,  Ayyuba Wabba; the president of the Academic Staff Union of Universities, Biodun Ogunyemi, among others, called for adoption of the minority report to address the nation’s socio-political and economic challenges. Balarabe Musa said the minority report harped on genuine federalism and total liberation from imperialism, adding that for Nigeria to move forward, the minority report should be examined.
