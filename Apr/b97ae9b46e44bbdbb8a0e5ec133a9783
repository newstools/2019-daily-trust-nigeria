The Senior Special Assistant on Special Duties to Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State, Yusuf A. Dingyadi, yesterday, threatened to sue those peddling lies against his principal. Dingyadi who stated this in Kaduna, said they would not allow propagandists to toil with the peaceful co-existence in Sokoto State established over the years. “They should desist from sending their foot soldiers to be writing nonsense on social media because they are downgrading the people of Sokoto State,” he said. “Governor Tambuwal has been able to tolerate their bashing and insults which encouraged them to go for the high level of propaganda and mischief against his personality and his office as the governor. “Let me quickly say this, we will soon sue some of them for writing against the peace and political conscience in Sokoto State. We are ready for anybody that wants to create a problem in our dear state,” he said. Yusuf called on the APC which filed a case at the tribunal against the victory of Gov. Tambuwal to wait and allow the tribunal decide and stop pre-empting the judgement.
