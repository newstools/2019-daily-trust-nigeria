The Akwa Ibom State Police Command has confirmed renewed clashes among cult groups in the University of Uyo. A 300-level Communication Arts student, identified as Fatherwills Ukpankere and three others were said to have been killed between Tuesday and yesterday when cult groups clashed. Police Public Relations Officer Odiko MacDon yesterday said the command was aware of the development following the death of three students as a result of clashes among cult groups in the university. “The Commissioner of Police is trying to meet with the management of the university, in order to strategise on how to tackle the menace and ensure adequate security for the university,” he said. The Director of Information in the institution, Mrs Blossom Okorie, said the university management had reported the incident to the police. A student, who simply identified himself as Uduak, said: “Before the last matriculation, there were shootouts. During the matriculation, there were clashes between cult groups. Just yesterday (Tuesday), a student was shot dead during a clash between two cult groups at the annex campus. “I heard that three more students were shot dead in the early hours of today (Wednesday) at the Main Campus, Nwaniba, even though I have not confirmed that yet. We are afraid that the cult groups that lost their members may come for reprisal.” Cultism bringing communities to their knees Three feared killed in cult clash in Edo Nobody died on our campus – Kwara poly rector
