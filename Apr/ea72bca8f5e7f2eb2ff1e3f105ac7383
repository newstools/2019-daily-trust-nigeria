An Islamic charity organization, Jaiz Foundation, has distributed Zakat items worth N3.5m to indigent persons in Lagos. About 79 persons were supported with the fund to ameliorate their educational, economic and health challenges. Some of the items distributed were grinding machines, sewing machine, generator sets, refrigerator, industrial gas cooker and cylinder. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Jaiz, Imam Abdullahi Shuaib, disclosed that N6m had been earmarked to be distributed as Zakat in Lagos. He explained that out of the N6m, the foundation spent N5.5m and the remaining N500,000 meant for educational support will be released next week. Imam Shuaib explained that the motive behind the support was to break the cycle of poverty among the Muslim faithful. He said, “Today we have about 79 beneficiaries for educational, economic empowerment and health challenge support. What we have seen today is practically around N3.5m. We still have outstanding N500,000 to disburse in the few weeks in Lagos.” One of the beneficiaries, Abdulrahman Bakare, a 300-level undergraduate of Electrical and Electronic Technology Education at the Federal College of Education Technical, Akoka, said he will use the money to pay his school fees. Also, Mrs. Salamah Shaibu who got a refrigerator said she will use it to boost her frozen food business.
