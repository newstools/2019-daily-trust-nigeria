The Zuba Unit Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Assistant Corps Commander Mohammed Shehu, has said plans are underway to set up a special marshal unit at the FCT College of Education in the area. Shehu, while speaking with newsmen last Friday in Zuba,  said the commission’s desire to establish a special marshal unit at the college was to enable the students to become FRSC ambassadors and to promote safety ideas  within the college. He said the command would solicit for the support  and assistance from one of the indigenous construction firms, Dantata & Sawoe, to construct a tall concrete barrier in order to prevent students from crossing the highway, even as he advised the students to sustain the culture of using the pedestrian bridge. He also advised motorists plying the route against reckless driving such as overspeeding, overloading and making phone call while driving, saying the command would continue to arrest erring drivers. The commander also called on commercial motorcycle operators in the area to adhere to traffic rules and regulations and avoid dangerous overtaking.
