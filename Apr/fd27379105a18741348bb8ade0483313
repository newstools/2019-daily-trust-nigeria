The National Council of Women Societies, (NCWS) has decried the lack of opportunities for women at all levels in the just concluded 2019 general elections in Nigeria. The President of the Council, Mrs Gloria Laraba Shoda, in a statement, described the situation as unimpressive and not good for the development of the country. “A lot of women emerged as candidates of their political parties to vie for various positions, but regretted that their male counterparts, with money bags, outweighed them. “The men had money to attract more votes to the detriment of the women who do not have the money to do so, which resulted to poor outcome of female emergence nationwide,” Shoda noted. She used the opportunity to call on the government at all levels to appoint women into their cabinet to close the gap. “I want to urge the federal and state governments to appoint women ministers, commissioners, heads of agencies with a view to closing the gap,” she said.
