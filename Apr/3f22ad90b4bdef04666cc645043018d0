Larry Mitchell Hopkins, 69, and his group United Constitutional Patriots, also plotted to target Hillary Clinton and billionaire George Soros, according to a tip received by the FBI. It is unclear when he allegedly made these comments, which were included in court papers released this week. His lawyer Kelly O’Connell has denied the allegations.
