A fire outbreak last night has razed a substantial part of the Department of Library and Information science of the Umaru Musa Yar’adua University, Katsina. The inferno, which cause is yet to be ascertained, started around 10:00pm and burnt down a classroom and office as well as  a mini library. Although no life was lost, many literary documents were lost, our reporter gathered. The state governor, Aminu Masari, accompanied by some top government officials have since visited the scene for on-the-spot assessment of the fire incident.
