The Executive Secretary of Nigerian Christian Pilgrims Commission (NCPC), Rev. Tor Uja, said the Easter pilgrimage slated for April was delayed due to operational reasons. Uja disclosed this in on Monday to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja. “The first reasons was because the general pilgrimage for 2018 only ended in the middle of February just before the general elections and the commission will not want Nigerians to be outside the country during the general elections. “The second reasons is that most of the stakeholders were busy with the elections and need time to make provision for the pilgrims. “We have to screens them, get their visas, sort them out and make adequate preparations for them. Also the commission has to go round the states which have not been done. “Thirdly and very serious, Israelis have their own holiday in the month of April and it starts from April 15 till the end of the month,” he said.
