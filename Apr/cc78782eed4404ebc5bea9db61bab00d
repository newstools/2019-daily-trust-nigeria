President Muhammadu should know that they (APC) rode to power by Chibok girls’ abduction and he should make sure these girls are released, enough of empty promises..If our government cannot, they should seek help of the international community and put an end to Boko Haram.” Speaking during a campaign to raise awareness on cases of abduction perpetrated by Boko Haram insurgents tagged “Stop targeting Women And Girls: It is Destroying the Society,” the executive director of Allamin Foundation for Peace and Development, Hamsatu Allamin, said: “The bitter fact about it is that no mention, no acknowledgement is ever made, not to talk of attempting to secure their freedom.” One of the mothers of abductees, Yamta Rose, said: “I’m begging the government to try their best and release our daughters and also, I’m appealing to Boko Haram to free these girls. Even if our daughters have children for them, we don’t care, they should release our daughters because we’re dying inside.” We are tired of empty promises, parents of Chibok girls tell FG In Chibok, anguish and broken promises still reign A year without Chibok girls
