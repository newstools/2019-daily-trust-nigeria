The Emir of Ningi, Alhaji Yunusa Danyaya, has asked his subjects not to resort to jungle justice in any incident. He gave the warning yesterday during a visit to Diwa Community of Ningi Local Government Area to sympathise with them over a recent attack by armed men.. According to him, though communities have the right to defend themselves, they must not apply jungle justice. “We all understand the trauma you people went through and we sympathize with you over the last Monday’s ugly incident when some armed  hoodlums about 700 of them on over 300 motorcycles came to attack your community and the security threats posed to the surrounding communities,” he said. He said communities should report any security threat to the appropriate authorities, avoid reprisals in case of attacks and use dialogue to resolve differences. “All you need is to defend your territories, property and lives,” he said. We will sacrifice our lives for our communities – Zamfara CJTF Gunmen kill 17 in fresh Zamfara attack Bandits kill 17 in Zamfara
