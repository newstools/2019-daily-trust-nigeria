Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode has inaugurated a 20-member transition committee charged with the responsibility of ensuring smooth transition of power to the incoming administration. Governor Ambode is expected to be succeeded by the governor-elect, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, when he hands over power on May 29, 2019. Ambode, who was represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Tunji Bello, said a smooth transition to the next administration was imperative to ensure that the machinery of government continues to run smoothly without any hitch, considering the economic importance of Lagos to the country. The governor charged the committee, which would be co-chaired by the deputy governor-elect, Dr Obafemi Hamzat and the Secretary to the State Government, to accord the assignment the diligence and commitment it deserves. The deputy governor-elect assured that the committee would immediately commence work and ensure that everything done was in the interest of the state, adding that it would be a transition of the same government as the incoming administration would build on the existing template to move the state forward.
