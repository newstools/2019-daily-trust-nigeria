One of the attackers behind the Easter Sunday bombings in Sri Lanka once studied in the UK, officials say, as further details on the bombers emerge. He visited south-east England in 2006-7 to study but did not complete a full university degree, a senior Whitehall official said. The attacker later did a course in Australia, Sri Lanka’s deputy defence minister said. The death toll has risen to 359, with more than 500 people wounded. This is even as the country admitted a “major intelligence lapse” before the attacks. An Indian intelligence warning about planned attacks was not properly shared by the authorities, parliament heard. President Maithripala Sirisena has moved to sack the defence secretary and inspector general of police. Eight of the nine attackers have been identified as Sri Lankan citizens.
