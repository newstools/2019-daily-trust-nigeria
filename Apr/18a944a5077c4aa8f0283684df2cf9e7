The Coalition of Young Female Candidates (CYFC) has called on INEC to adopt electronic process for future elections in Nigeria to help curb anomalies. The President of CYFC, Dr. Doris Opara, while speaking at a press conference to review their grievances during the just concluded elections, said the elections came with so many challenges for women, adding that there was injustice and insecurity. Dr. Opara added that religion and ethnicity were used in some areas to vote against women. “If INEC adopts the electronic system, it would help curb lots of challenges during elections,” she said. Dr. Opara said the newly inaugurated CYFC was put in place because of the desperate gap in the field of mentoring and a low degree towards investing in women. 2011: INEC’s preparation and matters arising Senate amends electoral act, collated results to be electronically transmitted CUPP heads to court in Kano
