Authorities of the Ekiti State College of Education, Ikere Ekiti, have begun sensitisation of students and members of staff of the school on Lassa fever. This follows the outbreak of the disease in some states of the federation. The management has advised students to maintain personal hygiene and be cautious of what they consume to prevent the spread of the disease in the institution. Describing the disease as deadly and contagious, the school said there was the need for the students to be watchful in view of the fact that their crowded population could easily ignite easy spread of the disease if it broke out. The College’s Director of Health Services, Dr Ayodeji Aturamu, at a sensitisation programme yesterday, said the students must be vigilant and quickly report any student who manifests symptoms of the disease so he can be isolated for treatment. Aturamu added, “A large population of our students came from outside and we have to take steps to ward off an outbreak of such an epidemic disease because existing inter-personal relationships among them could help its spread. “When you see any student showing symptoms of prolonged malaria, diarrhea, haemorrhage through body orifices, sore throat, vomiting and a swollen face, quickly alert us at the health centre for proactive steps. “You must ensure you maintain personal hygiene by keeping your environment clean and cover your food so that the rats identified to be the vector won’t have body contact with it.”    Lassa fever: Ondo Govt trains 54 surveillance officers, informants How we successfully managed Lassa fever patient – FETHI CMD Kogi Lassa fever patient dies
