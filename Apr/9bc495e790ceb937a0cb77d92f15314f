The PDP has directed all its members who instituted cases against the party to withdraw them or face sanctions. The Deputy National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Prince Diran Odeyemi, in a press statement, said the party considered myriad of cases instituted against it by members as inimical to the string of successes it had achieved in the last few years. Odeyemi said any PDP member with genuine interest in the party must not make himself available to be used by elements that wanted to slow down its progress through needless litigations. “We consider it inimical to our progress as a vibrant political party, the myriad of cases instituted against PDP by members who are expected to be part of the concerted efforts towards being the ruling party in Nigeria. “We can’t continue to struggle under the yoke of needless litigations when we intend to return to power both at federal level and in other states that are out of control of PDP at the moment,” the statement partly read. Odeyemi reminded members of a National Executive Council (NEC) decision to sanction any member, no matter how highly placed, who through court cases constituted themselves as cog in the wheel of progress of the party, adding that some members have been expelled from the party because of such issues in the recent past. “We are monitoring situations in Osun, Ekiti, Oyo, Lagos and other states across the country regarding court matters instituted by our members,” he added. Odeyemi, who assured aggrieved party members that they would get justice by using the party’s internal mechanism and not through the court, warned that any member that failed to comply with the directive would be sanctioned.
