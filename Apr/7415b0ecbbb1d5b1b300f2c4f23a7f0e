First City Monument Bank (FCMB) has taken another major leap in the retail and mobile banking segment of the Nigerian financial services industry. It has launched a new product called FCMB Easy Account. Described as banking made accessible to all, a significant and value-added feature of this product is that the telephone numbers of customers, without the first digit, will serve as their account numbers. The account is an enhanced version of its *329# Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) platform. In a statement, the bank explained that FCMB Easy Account had been designed to make banking accessible to all Nigerians and would help to achieve the laudable goal of financial inclusion for most Nigerians as set by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). It is a product open to all, particularly to meet the needs of low-income earners and the unbanked segment of the society. It enables the account holders have access to convenient and secured financial services irrespective of their locations. FCMB Easy Account customers can send and receive money to and from friends, families and business partners across all banks in Nigeria.
