The police in Ekiti State have arrested a 23-year-old man at a check-point allegedly hiding human parts in a polythene bag. The man, simply identified as Nifemi, was arrested on Saturday at Ijero-Ekiti with two burnt human hands during a police stop-and-search operation. Daily Trust learnt that the police in Ijero-Ekiti Division had beefed up security across the local government following a letter by armed robbers to the community that they would be attacking the residents. Nifemi was said to have run into the police cordon allegedly carrying a polythene bag bearing the human hands he intended to sell to a customer at Okemesi. “When quizzed by the police, the young man said he got the two hands at a farmstead near Okemesi and brought them to Ijero for onward transfer to Okemesi to sell to some people,” a police source told our correspondent. The Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti Command, Deputy Superintendent Caleb Ikechukwu, confirmed the arrest. “Our men arrested him during one of our operations. We are gathering more facts about the case because we are aware he has been operating with some people and they have to be brought to book,” Ikechukwu said.
