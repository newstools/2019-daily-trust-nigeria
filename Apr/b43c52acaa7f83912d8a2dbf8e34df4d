Ahead of a national convention in May, crisis has hit the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA), as northern leaders of the party have dissociated from the demand of the former national secretary of the party, Sani Abdullahi Shinkafi, for the chairmanship position of the party to be zoned to the north. This is contained in a statement by the Deputy National Chairman (North), Abubakar Adamu, after a meeting of the northern leaders of the party, yesterday in Dutse, Jigawa state and that called on all party faithful to disregard the demand by Shankafi, as the northern leaders of the party were not part of the Kaduna meeting neither contacted for such an important decision. The statement which has the signatures of 25 northern leaders of the party appended to it, added the former national secretary had on April, 20, chaired a meeting with some unknown people in Kaduna, demanding for the chairmanship of the party to be zoned to the north, saying the demand was selfish and did not represent the interest of the north. “We the northern leaders of All Progressive Alliance, wants to inform our members and the general public that we were not part of the Kaduna meeting and we are not in any way in support of the decision reached at the so-called APGA meeting in Asaa Pyramid Hotel, Kaduna on 20 April, 2019.”  Stakeholders want northern APGA nat’l chair APC  leaders renew efforts to counter governors on zoning Disquiet as PDP chairmanship crises deepen
