The Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria (ERA/FoEN) and the Nigeria Tobacco Control Alliance (NTCA) have urged the outgoing National Assembly to pass the draft National Tobacco Control Regulations (NTCR) before the end of the 8th assembly on June 6. They made the appeal Wednesday in Abuja during a protest at the Unity Fountain and at the National Assembly complex. They said it was in the interest of the nation that NTCR be passed to further strengthen the enforcement of the National Tobacco Control Act signed into law by former President Goodluck Jonathan just before he left office in 2015. A letter jointly signed by the Deputy Executive Director, ERA/FoEN, Dr. Akinbode Oluwafemi, and Programme Coordinator, NTCA, Oluwaseun Esan, and addressed to both the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, urged the lawmakers to resist attempts by tobacco corporations and their allies to frustrate the provisions of the regulations, and its speedy passage. The letter reads in parts, “As a signatory to the World Health Organisation’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), Nigeria is bound by that convention’s article 5.3 to place public health and tobacco control above the commercial interests of the tobacco companies and their allies. “We are aware that the current session of the National Assembly will end on June 6, thereby necessitating that the National Assembly needs to approve the draft Regulations within weeks. Nigerians will count this as a legacy achievement of the current leadership and members of the National Assembly.
