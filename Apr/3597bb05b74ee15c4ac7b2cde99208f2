Theresa May has told MPs it remains her “priority” to deliver Brexit, defending the decision to delay UK’s exit from the EU. The new deadline of 31 October means the UK is likely to have to hold European Parliament elections in May. The prime minister said that if the deal agreed with the EU was passed, the UK could leave the EU “as soon as possible”. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called the latest delay a “diplomatic failure”. The prime minister promised to pursue an “orderly” Brexit, adding that the “whole country” was “frustrated”. Brexit was originally set to happen on 29 March. But after MPs repeatedly rejected Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement with the EU, the deadline was put back to 12 April. The new 31 October deadline averts the prospect of the UK having to leave the EU without a deal this Friday. Under EU rules, the UK will have to hold European Parliament elections in May, or face leaving on 1 June without a deal. In a statement to the House of Commons, Mrs May said she “profoundly” regretted her deal not being agreed to by MPs.
