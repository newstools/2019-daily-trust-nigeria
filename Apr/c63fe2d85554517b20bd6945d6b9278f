The Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Tukur Yusuf Buratai, has said that the army was still in search of the remaining abducted Chibok girls. This is even as he reiterated that Boko Haram activities  have  been confined to Lake Chad and the Sambisa forest. Buratai stated this yesterday while delivering the maiden lecture of the Centre for Contemporary Security Affairs at the Igbinedion University, Okada, Edo State. He said President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration had fulfilled the pledge to support the MNJTF by donating the sum of $100 million. Buratai identified porous borders, large space of operational environment, insufficient international support, among others as the challenges militating the fight against insurgency. He said: “One of the silent but radical changes in the operations was changing the orientation and mind-set of troops from a defensive to an offensive posture. We also created the Theatre Command to coordinate the activities of the divisions involved in the operations.” “Socio-economic activities and free movement of people and goods have resumed in many areas. Significant improvements can be attributed to the systematic campaign led by the Army in conjunction with other security and elements of national power. “Success recorded so far is an indication that for Nigeria’s democracy to be consolidated, the military must not only play its part but must also fulfil the constitutional roles assigned to them.” Boko Haram activities only confined to Lake Chad, Sambisa forest – Buratai Buratai rekindles hope on rescue of Chibok girls We are restrategising to elimate Boko Haram finally from battlefield- Buratai
