The Chairman, Abuja Chapter of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), Mr Oluwafunminiyi Akande, has tasked the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) to improve on its digital services. Akande was speaking at a one-day seminar titled ‘Ease of Doing Business: Role and Impact of FIRS’, held in Abuja recently. He said: “For instance FIRS has been talking about e-filling and e-tax clearance certificate, but you discover that from January to February this year their internet network was completely slow. Meaning that we as practitioners cannot do any tax clearance, or digital transaction for our clients. And for some of these things, there are penalties attached,” Akande said He said this had made it necessary for policy makers and practitioners to meet to know which areas were not okay yet. On how the FIRS can improve on its services, the Chairman FCT Tax Practitioners Association Mr Kennedy Iwunlo, said FIRS should invest more in its digitalization infrastructure. “FIRS should invest more in their bandwidth. That is the digitization infrastructure.  A revenue agency that collects revenue should invest more in information technology,” he said. The Chairman of the Federal Inland Revenue Service, Babatunde Fowler, who was represented by the Director, Tax Audit Department, Najim Ajila, said FIRS has consistently improved its services to make sure that it delivered superior services to Nigerian businesses.
