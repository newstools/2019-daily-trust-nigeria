The Kwara state governorship, State and National Assembly elections petition tribunal has promised to do their work without fear or favour or any form of bias. This is as the judges warned counsels and political parties to be wary of persons who might be parading themselves as agents of the tribunal for fraudulent purposes. Speaking at the inaugural session of the tribunal in Ilorin on Thursday, its chairman, Justice Bassey Efiong, said that, “If any person or group comes to tell you that he or she is our agent for fraudulent purposes, please don’t believe it for we don’t have such agents”. The tribunal chairman who announced the names of other members as Justice Ngozi Okoaisabol and Justice Mariyam Ismail said “we shall do our work without any form of bias”. 2019 Elections: Judiciary set, trains tribunal members Election tribunal begins sitting in Calabar APC to drag election tribunal judge before NJC
