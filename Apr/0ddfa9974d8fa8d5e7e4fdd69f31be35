The Kwara central senator-elect, Dr Ibrahim Yahaya Oloriegbe, has called on the incoming APC members of the 9th assembly to respect the supremacy of the party for the progress of the Senate. Oloriegbe made the call following the reactions that greeted the endorsement of Sen. Ahmad Lawan as Senate President for the 9th Assembly by the party leadership and President Muhammadu Buhari. In a statement he issued in Ilorin, yesterday, he urged party members to respect the party’s decision to make the incumbent Majority Leader of the current 8th Assembly the Senate president for the incoming 9th Assembly. He said Sen. Lawan had been vetted and found to be credible, experienced and more than capable to lead the National Assembly towards progressive democracy and governance. Oloriegbe, who pointed out that Senator Lawan had received presidential backing, said this was not the time to kick-start another needless fight for superiority but the time to ensure harmonious relationship, especially between the executive and legislative arms of government for national development.
