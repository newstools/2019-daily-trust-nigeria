A political activist, Comrade Timi Frank, says the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is now in a better position ahead of 2023 going by its performance during the just concluded general elections. Frank, in a statement, yesterday, saluted the courage of Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, Bala Mohammed in Bauchi State and Umar Fintiri in Adamawa State for fighting hard to defend the mandate of the people for the opposition party. Frank also felicitated with all other PDP governors-elect, senators-elect, House of Representatives members-elect and all the State House of Assembly members-elect across the country. He said the opposition PDP fought a good fight throughout the country despite what he described as “evil marriage and conspiracy by the APC government with security agencies and the electoral body to turn Nigeria to a one party state.” “While I wholeheartedly congratulate the opposition PDP candidates across the country who could not be rigged, especially in Rivers, Bauchi, Adamawa, Oyo, Imo and others, I strongly believe that the judiciary will do the needful in Kano, Nasarawa, Kastina among other states where the will of the people were obviously manipulated,” he said.
