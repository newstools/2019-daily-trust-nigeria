The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Uche Secondus has said Nigeria is under siege.  In a statement on Friday, on the occasion of Easter by his Special Adviser on Media, Ike Abonyi, Secondus said Nigerians must intensify prayers for the nation.  Secondus said Nigerians should not allow the “prevailing hardship in the country and the unjust outcome of 2019 election” affect their spirit of love, brotherliness and peaceful co-existence.  He added that the period of Easter provided good opportunity for Nigerians to pray more to God to send succour to alleviate their sufferings.  “We must allow the spirit of this season embedded in love, charity and forgiveness to control our thoughts and actions as we seek God’s face for our country.”  “Nigerian Christians must allow the solemnness of the last 40 days of fasting and prayers to influence their thoughts and actions in relating with one another,” he said.
