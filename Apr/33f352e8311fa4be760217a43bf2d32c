There is tension in Jigawa State House of Assembly over a purported plot to re-instate the impeached Speaker, Idris Garba, popularly known as Kareka. The tenure of the present assembly expires on June 10, 2019. But Daily Trust gathered that nocturnal meetings were being held in the state and neighbouring Kano and Bauchi states. The issue is also said to have dominated the activities of the newly elected members of the state assembly. There are some conflicting reports suggesting that the plot to remove the incumbent speaker, Isa Idriss, for alleged ineptitude is receiving the support of the executive arm of government. The charged atmosphere in the 30-member assembly, it was gathered, stemmed from the demand for robust leadership. When contacted, the spokespersons to the governor and the state assembly, Bello Zaki and Babangida Usman Hadejia, denied knowledge of any plan to replace the present speaker. It could be recalled that the former speaker was impeached in January 2017 over what the members of the assembly described as high-handedness and abuse of power.
