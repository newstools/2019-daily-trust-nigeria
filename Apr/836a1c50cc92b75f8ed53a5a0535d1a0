The zoning of the presiding officers of the National Assembly to individuals by the national leadership of the APC is a recipe for chaos, a youth forum within the party has said. Addressing a press conference in Abuja yesterday, the Forum of Zonal/State Youths Leaders of APC said the party seemed to be divided at present. Reading the communique of the forum after a meeting, Comrade Terver Aginde, the North Central coordinator of the forum, said the party should allow members of the zones where positions were zoned to decide on the process and procedures. The APC youth leaders also called on the party to rescind its decision on the suspension of Gov. Rochas Okorocha and Ibikunle Amosun. “While we agree with the initiative to determine National Assembly leadership within defined parameters of zoning and ranking to ensure stability and discipline within the party, we must do so without undermining the independence of the legislature. Those that signed the communique were Maigari Bello Kasimu (Northeast), Abubakar Sadiq Saadu (Northwest), Odu Olisaemeka Onyeka (Southeast), Gabriel Iduseri (South South) and Lawal Ola Kolade (Southwest).
