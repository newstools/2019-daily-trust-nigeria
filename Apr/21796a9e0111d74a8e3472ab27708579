Two weeks after a boy was found wandering at the Orisunbare plank market in Isale Oja, Modakeke-Ile Ife, Osun State, his parents are yet to claim him. The eight-year-old boy, who identified himself as Emmanuel, was found by a good Samaritan who took him to the ‘B’ Division of the Nigeria Police at Oke-Otubu, Modakeke-Ife. The identity and address of the boy’s parents have remained unknown since March 20, 2019 when he was found wandering. The Permanent Secretary in the Osun State Ministry of Women, Children and Social Affairs, Mrs Omolara Ajayi, said necessary steps had been taken to locate Emmanuel’s parents and reunite him with them, but without success yet. In a press statement, Ajayi urged members of the public to assist in identifying the boy and locating his parents so he could be reunited with them.
