The Council of the of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has urged the federal government to urgently intervene and halt disruption that the numerous customs units are creating for importers, within and outside the ports. Besides, the Council also decried undue delay in the issuance of Pre-Arrival Assessment Report (PAAR) to importers, stressing that the delays create bottlenecks which makes the PAAR administration process vulnerable to corrupt practices. LCCI Council in a communiqué at the end of its bi-monthly meeting held in Lagos said having so many checking units at the Ports negate the ethics of ease of doing business agenda of the government as it hurts investors. LCCI, however, calls on the Comptroller General of the Nigeria Customs to investigate incessant delays in the release of PAAR and the associated transparency issues. “Delays cause high demurrage charges both by shipping companies and the terminal operators.  These constitute additional cost to business.  LCCI urges the CG Customs to quickly look into this problem”, it noted. LCCI also expressed worry over NNPC assumed monopoly status in the petroleum products production and importation in the economy, saying that it has become practically impossible for private sector petroleum products marketers to import and sell products because of the price distortions which the involvement of the NNPC has created in the industry.
