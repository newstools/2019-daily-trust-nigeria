A moving train has crushed two unidentified persons to death in Kano, our reporter has learnt. Conforming the incident to Kano Chronicles, the state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Haruna Abdullahi, said the incident occurred around Kano club ground around 8:00am yesterday. DSP Abdullahi said the deceased were laying down on the railway track when the moving train crushed them to death. “One of the victims was cut into two parts by the train. Our men have already evacuated the corpses of the victims and deposited same at a hospital morgue within the state metropolis,” he said. A local guard around the area told Kano Chronicles that the deceased might have been among the drug addicts that were conducting their heinous activities behind Kano club ground. “I am sure these boys (referring to the deceased) are among the boys that are taking drugs around this area. “You can always see them moving around in the area during both morning and night hours. Sometimes you can see them smocking Indian hemp freely in this area because no one can dare go near them, not to talk of stopping them. “We hope police will do something to rid the place from the activities of drug addicts. “They are posing serious threat not only to the local guards but also to the residents of the area. Our prayer is that government will bring the activities of hoodlums to an end in this area,” he said. 2-year-old boy dies in well at Yar’akwa, Kano How son hacked father to death in Jigawa Train kills Police Inspector, motorcyclist in Lagos
