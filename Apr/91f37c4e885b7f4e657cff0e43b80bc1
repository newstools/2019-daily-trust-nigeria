President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday in Maiduguri, Borno State, said his administration would not give up on the abducted Chibok and Dapchi schoolgirls still in Boko Haram’s captivity. Speaking at the Shehu of Borno’s palace after commissioning some projects executed by the administration of  Governor Kashim shettima, Buhari said: “Chibok schoolgirls in Borno and Dapchi Schoolgirls in Yobe State.  And unfortunately, some of the girls are still in captivity. We won’t give up on them. As I have always said,  as Nigerian and as president,  I assure all that we will do the needful to ensure that all Nigerians whose loved ones are in the hands of the Boko Haram terrorists regain their freedom”. Buhari said it was imperative that the Borno State Government focussed on education due to the peculiar security challenges posed by Boko Haram terrorists “whose ideology is against education and girl-child education.” The president said he was impressed  by Shettima’s “unique approach towards establishment of educational centres,  particularly  at the primary level. Shettima said the people of the northeast were eternally indebted to Buhari for his supports. He, however, lamented that the state had been battling with poverty, environmental issue and lack of access to education. According to him, Borno remains the only state without a federal polytechnic and a federal college of education. The Shehu of Borno lauded the president for the respect he accorded traditional institutions and for his efforts towards addressing the insurgency in the northeast. He promised to always provide information and advice on Boko Haram threats During his visit,  Buhari commissioned some of the 40 mega schools,  the Maiduguri hub, housing estates, and other projects executed by Shettima’s government.
