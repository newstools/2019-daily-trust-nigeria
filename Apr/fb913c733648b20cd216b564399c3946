Mr Yekini Nabena, All Progressives Congress (APC) Deputy National Publicity Secretary, has faulted the credibility of the recent governorship re-run elections in Bauchi, Sokoto, and Adamawa. Nabena alleged that the supplementary elections in the states fell short of the minimum standard. He made the observation on Thursday in Abuja while interacting with newsmen, stressing that APC would reclaim its stolen mandates through the election tribunal. “In Bauchi, Bala Mohammed was declared winner after a controversial re-run election, in Adamawa, Fintiri of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) won the governorship election. “And in Sokoto State, the incumbent Aminu Tambuwal was declared winner with a contestable margin, “ he said. Nabena observed that the re-run elections in the states were not conducted in line with laid down rules and regulations of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). He added that following a review of the governorship re-run election in Bauchi, Sokoto and Adamawa states, it was evident that the exercise was characterised by massive rigging, thuggery and vote buying. “It should be noted that while the APC has over two third of the members of the State House of Assembly in Bauchi and a clear majority in Sokoto State from the governorship election, the re-run was rigged and were conducted without regards to INEC laid down rules and regulations. “To this end, the outcome of these re-runs will be challenged at the election tribunals to reclaim our mandates given to us by the people in those states,“ Nabena said.
