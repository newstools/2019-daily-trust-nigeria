A two years old girl (name withheld) has been found dead in a pit toilet in Badariya area of Birnin Kebbi, Kebbi state. A witness, Maniru Shehu, who is also a resident of the area told our correspondent that the father of the girl, Malam Bello reported to neighbours and relatives that his daughter, Amira was missing and she was later found in a pit toilet on Thursday. He said “the parents notified the police in the area and we neighbours joined some relatives and the parents to begin intensive search for the girl but to no avail.” He explained that the girl’s father initially thought that the girl was kidnapped by people who would later demand for ransom. He added that two days after, the parents were desperate and worried and went on solo search for their daughter only to find her body floating in a soak-away few metres away from their house. The girl was believed to have fell into the pit toilet accidentally and drowned. Efforts to talk to the parents of the girl did not materialize as one of the relatives said they are still in shock over the death of their little girl. The state’s Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Nafiu Abubakar, confirmed the incident to our correspondent, saying “it was an unfortunate incident.” Man 'removes lover's breasts', dumps her in pit toilet Man dumps deceased girlfriend’s corpse in pit toilet Why I dump my baby in a latrine-Mother
