The chairman of Sanga local government in Kaduna state, Mr. Charles Danladi, has raised an alarm over plans to disrupt the peace in his local government. The LG boss called on the security agencies to investigate and bring those trying to cause mayhem in the LG to book. Danladi, while speaking at a press conference in Kaduna on Monday said he got security report that a campaign based on false claims alleging there’s a plan to move against Sanga indigenes who are Christians and are holding public office is about to  be unleashed by these persons to cause crisis in the LG. He said those behind the campaign met in Kaduna over the weekend under the auspices of a political party and had by the evening of Sunday, sent money to some persons in Sanga to fund protests scheduled for tomorrow, Tuesday, April 2, 2019. He said, “They want to cloak their negative activities under the guise of protecting me against alleged attempts to remove me as chairman of Sanga Local Government Council by Dr. Hadiza Balarabe, the deputy governor-elect of Kaduna State. “There is nothing of the sort and the masterminds know this but they seek to deliberately perpetrate falsehood and further irresponsible narratives.” Mr. Danladi said as chairman of Sanga, his duty is to ensure that nobody is allowed to threaten the peace and security in his area. He called on the people in the LG to be extra vigilant and guard against incitement on ethnic and religious lines saying they should take firm steps to defeat injurious falsehood being spread with the motive to cause crisis in the LG. He said the Kaduna state governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai swiftly sent relief materials through the State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA when parts of the LG came under attack.
