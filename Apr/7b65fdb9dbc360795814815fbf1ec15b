The Fiscal Responsibility Commission yesterday lamented the poor funding of road projects across the country. The acting chairman of the commission, Victor Muruako, called on the Federal Government to increase funding of federal roads in the country. Speaking yesterday in Itu Local Government Area during a tour of federal government road projects in Akwa Ibom State, Muruako alleged poor funding of Mbak Atai – Ikot Ntuk – Mkpeti – Oku Iboko Roads in Itu. He said the project, first awarded in March 2013 by the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs, had been executed to about 50 percent before it was stopped due to poor funding.
