In its efforts to combat corruption among member States, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has said it would engage in constant training and capacity building for anti-corruption officials to appreciate, understand and cope with the changing and emerging trends of corruption and corrupt practices in the region.  Speaking at the Network of Anti-Corruption Institutions in West Africa’s (NACIWA) meeting on developing faculties for Training on Corruption Risk Assessment (CRA) in Abuja on Thursday, the Director, Political Affairs, ECOWAS Dr Remi Ajibewa said, their experience of supporting the fight against corruption in the region has also predicated the need to direct their efforts not only on enforcement but also and more essentially on preventive measures in combatting corruption.  “Specifically, the identification of the possibilities and vulnerabilities of corrupt and unethical practices in public and private organizations is one of the effective measures to militate against corruption. In essence, preventing and fighting corruption effectively and proportionately means understanding the risks an organisation or agency may face. It is against this context that the importance of today’s meeting is situated.”  Dr Ajibewa added that ECOWAS has strategically chosen Anti-corruption institutions, the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC)to serve as coordinating pillar of the conduct of corruption risks assessment in Member States adding that they believe that the entry point should be through the establishment of Training Faculties on CRA in these institutions to serve as capacity building Centre and avenue to foster multi-stakeholder platform for the conduct of corruption risk assessment in government Ministries, Departments and Agencies in Member States.
