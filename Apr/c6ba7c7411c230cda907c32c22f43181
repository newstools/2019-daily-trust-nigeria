Bauchi State governor-elect Sen Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed has promised to review unpopular policies and other moves by the outgoing APC administration in the state. Speaking to journalists, yesterday, through his spokesman, Ladan Salihu, the governor-elect said the decision of Governor Mohammed Abubakar to create more districts and village areas was an attempt to create financial burden on the incoming administration. He said Governor Abubakar rejected and dissolved the districts and village areas created by former governor  Malam Isa Yuguda because of the financial situation of the state when he assumed power, wondering why the governor would approve same now. “If it was not good in 2015, why is it good in 2019 when the administration is about to go and a new one is coming in?” he said. He lamented that the outgoing APC administration had allegedly transformed the Bauchi State Universal Basic Education Board (BASUBEB) to a conduit pipe. He said the plan to award last minute contracts through the board was a move to enrich Governor Abubakar’s cronies, hangers-on and others. He therefore warned government officials and traditional rulers to avoid being roped into the last minute desperate attempts by the outgoing administration to put booby-traps on the incoming administration. Salihu, however, said the incoming administration would continue with beneficial policies that would take the state to greater heights.
