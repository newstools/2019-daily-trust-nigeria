The Senate appropriation committee failed to present the budget report that Senate President Bukola Saraki asked it to. Saraki had on Tuesday directed all committees to submit their budget reports to the appropriation committee. He also directed that the appropriation committee, after receiving the reports, should submit the entire budget report to the Senate yesterday. However, at yesterdayâ€™s plenary, the appropriation panel chaired by Sen Danjuma Goje (APC, Gombe) did not submit the report. It was learnt that some committees were yet to produce their reports hence the inability of the appropriation committee to come up with a report. The Senate had on Tuesday passed the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and Fiscal Strategy Paper (FSP) and promised to pass the 2019 budget next week.
