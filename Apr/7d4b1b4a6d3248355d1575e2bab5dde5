Barrister Mohammed Bello Mustapha, an aspirant for the office of national secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says he has an edge over other aspirants eyeing the exalted seat in the ruling party. Mustapha, who said this yesterday in Abuja while fielding questions from journalists, stated that he was the most qualified personality among others in terms of competence and capability. The former governorship candidate of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) in Taraba State, expressed optimism that the top echelon of the APC leadership, including Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, would fulfil the promise made at the 2018 national convention by ensuring that he took over from the Yobe State governor-elect Mai Mala Buni who had vacated the seat. Mustapha, who had earlier vied for the position of national secretary in 2014, said he stepped down for Buni after the commencement of voting during last yearâ€™s convention after party leaders intervened that he would be adequately compensated. He said his decision to step down after wide consultations and ignore calls to pursue the case in court must be compensated now with the position of national secretary.
