The president of the Nigeria labour Congress, Ayuba Wabba, has called on other state governors to emulate their Yobe counterpart, Ibrahim Gaidam, on prompt payment of salaries and gratuities. He made the call in Damaturu yesterday at a book launch chronicling the one-decade stewardship of Gaidam. The NLC president presented a paper on “Prudence and Accountability as Panacea for Effective Implementation of Minimum Wage in Nigeria: The Yobe State Example”. Wabba, who is the key speaker at the launch of the book titled: “Founder of Modern Yobe”, said despite the security challenges and the harsh economic situation, the governor was up-to-date in the payment of salaries, pensions and gratuities. He said Gaidam’s administration had also invested heavily in the infrastructural development of the state. Earlier, Yobe State governor-elect, Mai Mala Buni, said Gaidam had piloted the affairs of the state with a high sense of responsibility, institutionalising transparency, prudence, probity and accountability in government expenditure for effective service delivery. “It’s quite fulfilling to see government pay salaries, pensions and gratuities, execute people-oriented projects and social services at a time when most states with less security challenge and more robust economy depend on federal bailouts to offset workers’ salaries”, he stated.
