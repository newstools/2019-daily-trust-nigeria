The acting CEO/Managing Director, CWG Plc, Mr Adewale Adeyipo, has advocated for an inclusive ecosystem that will aid the technological development of the African continent He joined other African leaders, recently, in discussions that would allow the continent edge further towards building a more viable digital economy; which will ultimately turn Africa into a technology-driven, knowledge-based economy. Adeyipo, according to a statement, spoke at the 7th edition of the Africa CEOs Forum held in Kigali, Rwanda recently. He said Africa’s labour market is currently being disrupted as over 65 percent of primary school children today are likely to work, in the next few years, in jobs or fields that do not presently exist. “Africa is rapidly becoming a consumer of digital services rather than creator in today’s digital economy and to change this scenario, we need to rethink the existing model and build a sustainable digital ecosystem and as well create more digital champions for our children of today,” he stated, while sharing views on building an ecosystem for digital technologies in Africa. Speaking further, Adeyipo advised that the continent creates broader awareness and the deployment of a digital economy that can follow the ‘integrated design approach’ that will bring together specialisms usually considered separately. He made reference to a report by the GSMA Intelligence Report of 2018 which showed that the mobile economy in Africa will generate more than $150 billion (or 7.9% of GDP) while 300 million people are expected to come online by 2025. “The question then is; would all these be enough for Africa to be ready?” he asked rhetorically.
