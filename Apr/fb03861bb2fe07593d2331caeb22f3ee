Eight Nigerian universities have signed a partnership with SASSAKAWA/SG2000 on boosting extension services for the enhancement of productivity in the Nigerian agricultural sector. The Country Director of SASSAKAWA, Professor Sani Miko, made this known at the Ahmadu Bello University’s (ABU’s) National Agricultural Extension Research and Liaisons Services (NAERLS), Zaria. He said this year’s national annual review and planning workshop was meant to improve the knowledge of extension workers. He added: “The universities that are collaborating with us in this direction are  ABU, Bayero University Kano, Adamawa State University, University of Ilorin, Usman Danfodio University, Federal University, Dutsinma, Federal University, Umudike and University of Ife. “We understand that extension agents that reached apex to give vital contribution to agricultural extension were not happy with the job, because they were HND graduates. They remained stagnant and cannot be promoted. “Again, they don’t go for knowledge update on modern farming, hence the introduction of the programme to assist, sustain and accommodate such people. The extension agents will graduate and become more practically and theoretically relevant.” Declaring the workshop opened, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. Audu Ogbe, who was represented by a Director in the ministry, Mr. Dele Olorefemi, said Nigeria had expanded the SAA/S2000 programme from 2009 to address the challenges of post-harvest handling of crops and access to markets by small-holder farmers. ABU Vice Chancellor, Professor Ibrahim Garba, said agriculture needs must be given the desired priority and attention because of the vital role they could play in the economic growth of Nigeria. ‘Agric thrives in Nigeria with technologies developed by ABU’ SASAKAWA says farmers’ low productivity needs holistic approach Institute says rice, sorghum, cassava will witness poor harvest
