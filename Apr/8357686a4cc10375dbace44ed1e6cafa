The Kaduna State Government has imposed a 24-hour curfew in Kajuru LGA , following renewed hostilities between the Adara and Hausa communities residing in Kasuwan Magani. Kasuwan Magani is a 30-minute drive from the state capital and has experienced several crises in the past two years. Daily Trust Saturday learnt that tension started on Thursday when two Adara youths were attacked while returning from a market in Kasuwan Magani. One of the youths who was badly beaten during the attack later died at a hospital in Kaduna. The attack on the Adara youths, sources say may not be unconnected with the discovery of the body of a Hausa youth in a well at an abandoned building on Wednesday. The boy had been missing for four days was discovered with eyes plucked out. The news of the death of the Adara youth on Thursday created tension but our correspondent gathered that a team of security personnel were dispatched to the area from Kaduna which helped calm the situation. Hostility however resumed early yesterday morning while security personnel were combing the bushes leading to a breakdown of law and order. A competent source said before the situation could be brought under control, two people, a man and a woman, were reportedly killed, and one house burnt. Kaduna Deputy Governor Barnabas Yusuf Bala directed vigorous enforcement of the curfew and has urged citizens to comply and support peace efforts in the community.
