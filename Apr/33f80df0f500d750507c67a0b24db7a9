Over 157,000 candidates for the 2019 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), yesterday sat for mock exams in 698 centres nationwide. But two officials of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) were said to have been assaulted at an exam center in a higher institution in Lagos. JAMB Registrar, Is-haq Oloyede, made the statement shortly before inspecting the mock exams at the Global Distance Learning Institute (GDLI), in Abuja. He said over 157, 000 UTME candidates sat mocks in 698 out of the 712 centres while the remaining 14 centres were deregistered over infringements. He said two officials delegated to a centre at a higher institution in Lagos to maintain proper conduct of the mock exams were assaulted and ‘almost murdered.’ He neither stated the reason nor those behind the assault but said the incident was being probed. He said the mock exams which were meant to improve the knowledge of matriculants and help them overcome pressure and sloppy mistakes, were conducted free of charge at all JAMB centres but candidates paid N700 each at private Computer Based Test (CBT) Centres. Minister of Education Adamu Adamu said the exam was conducted efficiently in Abuja said and would serve as practice for the main UTME.
