Ethiopian Airlines has concluded plan to launch a thrice weekly flight to Marseille, France, on July 02, 2019. Marseille is the second-largest city of France and main city of the historical province.

We’ve been flying to Paris since 1971, more than 48 years, so we are not new to the market in France. But we are very happy to expand our services closer to the customers in Marseille now. The connectivity we are establishing between Europe and Africa is facilitating trade, investment, tourism and people-to-people ties. “As we forge ahead on the path of growth and success as envisioned in Vision 2025, we will keep on opening new routes to all corners of the world; bringing Africa ever closer to the rest of the world.” We will collaborate with Nigeria on national carrier – ET As Ethiopian acquires 49 percent stake in new Chadian airline Ethiopian Airlines commences flight to Kaduna
