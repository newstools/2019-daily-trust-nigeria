 The Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) will probe commercial banks over stamp duty collections. According to a press statement signed by the Commissionâ€™s spokesperson, Mr. Ibrahim Mohammed, the probe which is to commence soon would involve a forensic investigation of the funds that have so far been collected as stamp duty by 22 Deposit Money Banks (DMB) from 2000 to 2018. RMAFC is the only constitutional body vested with the powers to monitor all revenue accruals into the Federation Account. To this end, the statement explains that the commercial banks had been deducting the sum of N50 on every deposit with a value of N1,000 and above since January 2000. At the moment, the total sum of N33 bn had been realised through the collection of stamp duties which falls far below the expectation of stakeholders. It is expected that at the end of the exercise, over 100 billion would be recovered. The statement further adds that the Commission had concluded arrangement to engage the services of reputable forensic audit firms to carry out the probe of the banks. The probe will be comprehensive as it will cover the affixed stamp used on cheque books prior to the introduction of electronic transactions.
