The Nigerian Association of Auctioneers (NAA) has said that there is over N1 trillion worth of unserviceable assets waiting for disposal across the country. A statement signed by the national president of the association, Alhaji Aliyu Kiliya, urged the three tiers of government to engage the services of the auctioneers to speed up their disposal so as to generate revenue to fund the national budget. He said the auctioneers can generate more revenue from the highest bidders whom they will invite from far and near. He said the association also play a great role in protecting the image of the government and the interest of the public to avoid litigation. ‘We recovered over N1.2bn Naira for government last year’ Auctioneers press Nasarawa govt to auction out unserviceable vehicles Auctioneers commend Sokoto, Bauchi for transparent asset disposal
