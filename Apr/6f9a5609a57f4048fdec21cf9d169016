The Cross River State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) yesterday raised the alarm over mass influx of refugees displaced by political crisis in Southern Cameroon in the state. A senior staff of SEMA, Mr Hilary Agida,  who spoke to journalists in Ogoja in the northern part of the state stated this when he received members of National Association  of Sea Dogs who visited one of the camps to donate food items to the refugees. Agida said two camps were initially created to accommodate 4,000 refugees; but that mass arrival now stood at 10,000 in the two camps thereby dangerously impacting facilities and food rations. Agida said an additional camp was created to accommodate the influx, but that one too had been over flooded making the situation desperate for the state government alone to handle. He said: “There are two refugee camps here in Ogoja, one is in Adagom and the other at Akpakpanga and both camps have been witnessing steady influx of refugees effectively over stretching the facilities here and something must be done to  address the situation before we witness a disaster here”.
