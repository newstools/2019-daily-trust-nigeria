At least 10 people were killed yesterday in a fresh attack on Vaase village in Ukum Local Government Area of Benue State. Daily Trust gathered that the community, situated at the borders of Benue and Taraba States, was attacked early hours of the day. The Benue State Security Adviser, Col. Paul Hemba, confirmed that he received reports that between eight and 10 people were killed in the attack. Hemba said that according to the report he received, the attackers were a combination of Jukun militia and herdsmen. He recalled that he had alerted the police last week when he got intelligence that some herders planned to invade Vaase. He said the police actually went to survey the area on Wednesday based on the report and had made arrangements to deploy personnel there on Thursday, but that the attack happened before their arrival. Hemba said the incident occurred despite three consecutive meetings both state governments held in Wukari towards finding a lasting resolution. He appealed for calm, saying the situation had been brought under control even as he noted that about 100 houses were burnt while 3,000 Tiv people already displaced from their homes in Taraba state are taking refuge in the Benue neighbouring communities. The spokesman of the Benue State Police Command, Catherine Anene,Â  did not respond to a phone made to him by our reporter. 5 killed in renewed attack on Benue community Village head, cop killed in fresh Benue, Nasarawa clashes Schools, health centres, houses burnt in Tivs/Jukuns crisis
