Eighty-one-year-old Fulani man, Abdullahi Ibrahim, has  appealed to the  Inspector General of Police Mohammed Adamu, to intervene and  recover his 31 cows confiscated by policemen in Kaduna State since 2018. Arewa Trust reported last week how some policemen, led by a Divisional Crime Officer, stormed the small village of Kaban in Igabi Local Government Area of the state and whisked away the cows to an unknown destination. It was gathered that since the police took away the cows effort by the owner and his family to get them back  failed as the police refused to release them. The old man told Arewa Trust in Kaduna how the policemen who confiscated the animals from his house kept telling him and his children that their cows were in court custody and not with the police. “We went and met with the judge at his chamber and he told us that the cows were not brought to court as claimed by the police and that he already instructed the police to release the cows to us but I told him the police are yet to release them,” he said. He pleaded with the police authorities to have mercy on his family by releasing the cows. “Honestly, I’m confused because those cows are what I used to take care of my family and  the police are not willing to return them to me. “All  I want from the police is to please return my cows which they claimed are 28 cows and two sheep. These are what they claimed were ‎confiscated from my home and I don’t mind let them just release the cows to me. This is why I’m appealing to their leaders to please help us,” he said. When contacted the Police spokesman, DSP Yakubu Sabo, said he would not comment on the issue until he could get more information from the ‎unit that is investigating the case.‎ JUST IN: 31 cows missing in police custody in Kaduna Falgore Forest: Where Kano’s deadly  bandits dwelled Rustled cow recognises owner one year after
