The Director-General of the National Youth Service Corps, Major-General Sulaiman Zakari Kazaure, has advised corps members in Gombe State to be vigilant and security conscious during the service year. He gave the advice in Gombe during a visit to the 2019 Batch ‘A’ corps members posted to the state for the one-year national service at the Temporary Orientation Camp at Amada, Akko Local Government Area. Kazaure said: “I am calling on you to be security conscious, shun all forms of social vices like cultism, other sharp practices and avoid indecent dressing as well as late night parties. “Also graduates, you must be of good character and learning, therefore you must respect the tradition and culture of the host communities where you will be posted for your primary assignments.” He advised the corps members to fully participate in Community Development Services (CDS) by initiating development projects in their host communities. He also urged them to take the advantage of different vocational skills training under the Skill Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Development (SAED) programme for their success during and after the service year “as white collar jobs are no longer available.” Gombe: NYSC DG urges corps members to be security conscious NYSC DG advises FCT corps members’ on safety Jigawa: Always be security conscious, NYSC DG tells corps members
