The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) has arrested the chairman and three top management members of the Committee of Federal Polytechnic Rectors (COFER) for allegedly being in possession of N10.2 million bribes. The arrested rectors are Abubakar Sadiq Yahaya (Federal Polytechnic Mubi), who is the chairman of COFER; John Taiwo Adekolawole (Federal Polytechnic Ede), and Arch. Waziri Sanusi Gumau (Federal Polytechnic Bauchi). They were said to have been arrested at the premises of the National Board for Technical Education (NABTE) Abuja, through a sting operation by the commission, the spokesperson of ICPC Rasheedat Okoduwa said in a statement yesterday. Arrested alongside the rectors was the secretary of COFER, Ayegba Benjamin Godwin, with the sum of N10, 250, 000 cash after a whistle-blower informed ICPC that the four suspects and others at large were perfecting plans to violate the provisions of Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act, 2000. The suspects who have been granted administrative bail by ICPC will be charged to court as soon as investigations are concluded, Okoduwa stated.
