A pressure group, Middle Belt Youth Movement for Unity, Equity, Fairness and Justice, has urged the Comrade Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee (NWC) of the APC to reconsider its zoning of office of the Speaker of the House of Representatives to the South West. The spokesperson of the group, Comrade Aaron Mike Odeh, who addressed journalists yesterday in Abuja, appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure equitable distribution of all sensitive national positions to give all the geo-political zones a sense of belonging. Com. Odeh particularly appealed to President Buhari and all political leaders in Nigeria to support the call for the zoning of the speakership of the 9th National Assembly to the South East; which is home to one of the three major ethnic groups in Nigeria. He said Abia State-born Rep. Nkiruka Onyejeocha, who is a high ranking third term federal lawmaker from the zone, was qualified to become speaker and pilot the affairs of the 9th Assembly in view of her wide experience in the legislative business, administrative arena and social relations. “We are making a special appeal once again to Mr. President, the leadership of all political parties, her colleagues in the green chamber and the entire Nigerians to please give her all the necessary support. “It is our earnest prayer and belief that as the new leadership of the green chamber shall be formed come June 26, 2019, Hon. Nkiruka Onyejeocha shall by the special grace of God emerge as the speaker,” Odeh said. He added that the decision was taken at the end of a two-day strategic meeting with the major aim of brainstorming on how members of the Middle Belt in Nigeria and beyond could develop in all areas. ‘With 2.4m votes for Buhari, N’Central deserves speakership’ NASS leadership: BYO dissatisfied with APC zoning arrangement Ninth House: Meet Reps who want Dogara’s job
