As part of effort to address the power challenge in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), Salman Shagaya Foundation, is set to embark on a solar light project within the metropolis. The project, according to the foundation’s spokesperson, Mr. Ibraheem Abdullateef, will benefit 4,000 households across the state. The NGO, which is owned by a philanthropist, Sheriff Shagaya, said the Solar Intervention Scheme (SIS) was geared towards providing stable electricity and improving security, particularly at night, in selected Kwara communities. This is coming barely two weeks after the foundation empowered over 600 people with N10,000 each business grant. Meanwhile, Hon. Shagaya urged residents of beneficiary communities and other members of the public to give the solar light engineers the necessary support and cooperation when the project started so as to aid its speedy completion.
