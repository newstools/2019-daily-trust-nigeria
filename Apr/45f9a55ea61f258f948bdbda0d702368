TCN said it has restored normal power transmission through its Apo Transmission substation after a fire outbreak at about 1:33 pm involving one of its 45MVA 132/33kV power transformers feeding AEDC’s 33kV feeders. The fire was put off by the combined efforts of the Federal, FCT and NNPC fire service. It is however still early for TCN to determine if the burnt transformer can be salvaged. In the statement signed by the General Manager (Public Affairs), TCN said the fire resulted from a direct fault from one of Abuja Disco’s 33kV feeders which had a history of incessant trippings, the 33kV lacked protection. Meanwhile, TCN said it is equally investigating possibility of transformer protection failure on its 45MVA power transformer. The 33kV feeder H13 circuit breaker and current transformer exploded while the 33kV outgoing transformer snapped causing the fire. TCN however noted that the Apo Transmission Substation has other transformers and so, power supply to all the areas that take supply from the substation through AEDC will not be affected by the incident. This is because the maximum load taken by AEDC from the burnt 45MVA transformer was 26MW. Meanwhile maximum load AEDC takes from the old 100MVA in the substation is 56.5MW while maximum load from the second 100MVA power transformer installed last year is 30.8MW. Both however can take at full capacity, a total of 160MW against the 86.5MW, it noted. Presently, TCN it is transmitting normal supply through the 2x100MVA 330/132kV and the second 45MVA 132/33kv power transformers in the substation. The company has equally loaded the 26MW from the burnt transformer into the 100MVA MBH transformer at the substation and is adequately supplying AEDC without load reduction. TCN said it is also working with the Abuja Electricity Distribution company to ensure that it now takes the load formally taken from the burnt transformer through the MBH 100MVA transformer.
