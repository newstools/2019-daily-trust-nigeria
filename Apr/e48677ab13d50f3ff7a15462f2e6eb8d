Stakeholders have harped on the need for the passage of the Nigerian Metallurgical Industry Bill (MIB) now before the National Assembly (NASS) and have it signed by President Muhammadu Buhari. They spoke at the ongoing 2nd Nigerian Metallurgical Industry Stakeholders’ Forum (MISF) (Engagement with the South-South Zone), with ‘ theme ‘Development of Nigeria’s Metal Sector – A Panacea for National Development and Imperative for Economic Diversification’, in Asaba, Delta State. Presenting his goodwill address, the Secretary General, Association of African Iron and Steel, Prof. Sanusi Mohammed, who disclosed that the bill has passed through 2nd reading at NASS said it is required to get the sector working again, adding that lack of regulatory mechanisms in the sector has been the bane of progress. “Those concerned have to put in the best of their effort to ensure that the bill is passed by the National Assembly and signed by Mr President because without the regulatory mechanisms, the industry players will continue to have a field day as no one can hold them accountable,” he said. According to him, with the bill becoming law, the Department of Metallurgical Inspectorate and Raw Materials Development will be empowered to monitor activities of sector players effectively to ensure the right thing is always done. Prof. Mohammed, who attributed the incessant cases of building collapse in the country to poor metal quality, said the department will also be able to control the source of raw materials and play a good role in the area of health and safety of workers in the sector. Presenting an overview of the sector, the acting Director Metallurgical Inspectorate and Raw Materials Development (MI & RMD) and Chief organiser of the event, Victor Ihebinike who expressed hope that the bill will be passed this time, said the ministry has taken steps to address all the bottlenecks that made the president not to sign the bill when it was presented before him by the previous assembly.
