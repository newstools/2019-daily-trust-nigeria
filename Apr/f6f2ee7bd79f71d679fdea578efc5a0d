The Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) yesterday reiterated its powers under the relevant provisions of the Lagos State Traffic Laws of 2012 (as amended) to impound any vehicle and apprehend recalcitrant motorists who contravene any section of the law. LASTMA’s Chief Executive Officer, Mr Chris Olakpe, said while receiving members of the Humanitarian Voluntary Association for Community Development (HVACD), who came to express their sympathy over the death of 18 traffic officials of the agency that died on line of duty in 2018, that contrary to the misinformation in some sections of the media, the agency was fully empowered by law to effect an arrest where and when necessary. Olakpe, a retired Assistant Inspector-General of Police, said the Lagos State traffic laws equipped the agency’s officials with the power to arrest where appropriate and allow the alleged offender pay the fine stipulated for the offence under the law. In addition, the LASTMA boss said the law allows for penalties for neglect of traffic directions, while disobeying traffic control personnel also attracts fines and impounding of vehicles.
