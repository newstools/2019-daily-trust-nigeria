The Senate is set to pass the N8.83 trillion 2019 budget proposed by President Muhammadu Buhari on December 19 last year. Senate President Bukola Saraki, who announced this at Tuesdayâ€™s plenary, said the Senate would do all it could to pass the budget on that day. Saraki said all committees that were yet to submit their budget defence reports to the appropriation committee should do that in the next few days. He also directed that the appropriation committee headed by Sen Mohammed Danjuma Goje (APC, Gombe) should ensure that the budget report is ready before April 16. Consequently, the Senate adjourned plenary to April 9 to allow committees conclude work on the budget.
