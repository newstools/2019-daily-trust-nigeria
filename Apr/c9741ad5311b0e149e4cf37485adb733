St. Vincent De Paul Hospital of the Daughters of Charity Abuja,  has provided free medical screening and treatment for residents of Kubwa and other areas of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The residents were offered vital signs tests and were also screened for blood sugar, hepatitis as well deworming and malaria treatment for children. Speaking during the outreach at the hospital’s new ultra-modern facility, in Kubwa, coordinator of the hospital, Reverend Sister Mary Okoro, said the hospital decided to provide the outreach because many residents could not afford to go to hospital to access healthcare. “The aim of doing this outreach is to help those who don’t have money to go for tests and treatment. We saw that many people, especially in Kubwa and environs, cannot afford to go for tests and Daughters of Charity, seeing the poor as representing God and those who need basic health system, decided to use the World Health Day to organize the outreach,” she said. Dr. Ezie Patrick C, Deputy Chairman Hospital Advisory Council of  the hospital, said the new 100 bed hospital facility offered free screening, treatment and deworming of children  to contribute  towards the goal of this year’s  World Health Day. With theme ‘Ensuring Universal Health Coverage’, the seeks to ensure that every citizen has access to  basic healthcare. Mohammed Isah who came from Nasarawa State for the outreach said he and his son benefitted from the free screening and deworming exercise. He commended the hospital, saying it has given many people access to healthcare.
