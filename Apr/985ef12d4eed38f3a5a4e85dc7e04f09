The Edo State Government has dismissed rumour of impending scarcity of petrol in the state, saying government will not tolerate artificial scarcity. A statement signed by the Commissioner for Solid Minerals, Oil and Gas, Joseph Ugheoke and made available to journalists on Saturday, cautioned marketers against selling above the approved pump price of N145 per litre. Ugheoke reiterated the state governmentâ€™s commitment to ensuring availability of petroleum products, noting that products were adequately supplied and will be promptly distributed across the state. He said there was an increase in supply of petroleum products in the state to forestall any form of scarcity, assuring that there was no need for panic buying of the products in anticipation of scarcity. The commissioner warned that any marketer caught selling above the stipulated pump price of N145 per litre or causing a hitch in the supply chain, will be severely dealt with in accordance with the law. According to him, government was working with the Department of State Services (DSS), Nigeria Police Force, Department of Petroleum Resources and other relevant stakeholders to check the trend and bring the perpetrators to book.
