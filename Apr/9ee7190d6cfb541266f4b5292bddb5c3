Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange has been arrested at the Ecuadorian embassy in London where he took refuge in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over a sexual assault case that has been dropped. At Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Thursday he was found guilty of failing to surrender to the court. The UK will decide whether to extradite Assange, in response to allegations by the Department for Justice that he conspired with former US intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to download classified databases. He faces up to five years in US prison if convicted on the charges of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. Assange’s lawyer Jennifer Robinson said they would be fighting the extradition request.
