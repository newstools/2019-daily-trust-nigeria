The Federal Capital Territory (FCTA) has advocated for the adoption of needs assessment to fast track development across communities in the territory. The director of finance and administration of the Area Councils Services Secretariat, Mrs. Olanikpekun Lola, who spoke with newsmen in Abuja, noted that the scheme would help in prioritising projects for rural communities. She said the assessment would also help identify areas of immediate intervention and how to implement them, while the area councils’ projects would be based on the process to create better impact. She said with the commitment of the secretariat in providing people-oriented services, more was required in the area of identifying communities’ needs before executing any project. She further said that the secretariat would be assisting the area council chairmen to deliver the desired results as well as to ensure that they implement the developmental agenda of the secretariat.
