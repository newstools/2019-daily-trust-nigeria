The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has denied alleged victimization of civil servants perceived to be sympathetic with the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) in Sokoto state. In a statement made available to newsmen today, the state Chairman of the party, Alhaji Ibrahim Milgoma, described the allegations as lies and unfounded. “Our party as well as all the entire people of Sokoto state are aware that these allegations by the APC are actually right about their post election blueprint, if they had won,” he stated. “It is common knowledge that the APC planned a massive sack of civil servants, who did not support their party and targeted many of them for physical assaults and other forms of humiliation,” the statement alleged. It also described the claim by APC of being supported by 80 percent of civil servants as ridiculous. According to the statement, “the only few civil servants opposed to the Tambuwal administration were those, who rejected his accountability and prudent style of leadership in contrast to Wamakko’s extravagant and wasteful regime, during which public funds were diverted and splashed recklessly on the streets. ” He stated: “Tambuwal’s government owes nothing to its workers, having been prompt in salaries and even providing salary advances in periods of need. The sale of all government quarters to occupants, a majority of whom are civil servants.” “Workers enjoyed loans and trainings during Tambuwal’s administration which have improved their capacity for service and their future endeavours,” it added.
