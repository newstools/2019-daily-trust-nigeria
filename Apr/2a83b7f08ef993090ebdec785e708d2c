The Imo State Governor, Rochas Okorocha, has asked civil servants to ignore an order given by the Governor-elect, Emeka Ihedioha, barring them from issuing land titles. Gov. Okorocha, in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Sam Obwuemeodo, reminded Ihedioha that he was not yet the governor. The governor, who said there was no office like “governor-elect”, asked the workers to ignore both the directive and the threat. The statement read in part, “There is no office like governor-elect in the Constitution of Nigeria or in any other known ordinance. In other words, there is only one office of the governor in the state. And Owelle Rochas Okorocha is the occupant of that office now. “Owelle Okorocha is the only one that has the constitutional right to issue such directives, not the governor-elect. Therefore, those concerned should continue to do their work without fear of molestation since they have not contravened any law of the land or any civil service rule. And the activities of government cannot be kept on hold because someone has been declared winner of a contentious governorship election,” he added.
