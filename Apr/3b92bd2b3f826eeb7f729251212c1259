Rita Orji (PDP, Lagos), the member representing Ajeromi/Ifelodun Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives,  has asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to declare her winner of the February 23 National Assembly election in the area. Orji, who made the call at a press conference in Abuja over the weekend, was reacting to last week’s judgment by Justice Bello Kawo-led Federal High Court, Abuja, which ruled out a re-run, and ordered INEC to declare collated results of all polling units in the Federal Constituency.
