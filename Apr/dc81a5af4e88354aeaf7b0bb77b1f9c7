The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has issued a 30-day ultimatumÂ to Globacom Limited and other Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) providers to comply with the statutory Aviation Height Clearance (AHC) or risk the pull down of their over 7,000 telecommunication masts and towers due to safety violation.  This follows the refusal of telecommunication providers to obtain the statutory Aviation Height Clearance (AHC).  According to the CAA, without AHC, all the masts and towers constitute danger to safety of air navigation.  Under the Civil Aviation Act, 2006, Section 30(3)(1), the NCAA is empowered to prohibit and regulate the installation of any structure which by virtue of its height or position is considered to endanger the safety of air navigation.  Furthermore, the Nigeria Civil Aviation Regulations (Nig.CARs) Part 12.1.7.1.3.1 stipulates that No person or organisation shall put up a structure (permanent or temporary) within the navigable airspace of Nigeria unless such a person or organisation is a holder of Aviation Height Clearance Certificate granted under this Regulation.  Consequent upon this provision, the Regulatory Authority requires an Aviation Height Clearance (AHC) approval for every tower installation irrespective of the height and location.  NCAA however said the telecom service providers have failed to comply with the regulations.
