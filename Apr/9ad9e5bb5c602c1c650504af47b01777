Governor Kashim Shettima has said that the people of Borno will prevail on Sen. Mohammed Ali Ndume to step down for Ahmad Lawan, the APC’s preferred candidate for the position of Senate President. Shettima said he believed as loyal party members, they should respect the decision of the party in the adoption of Lawan to be the next Senate president. Speaking to journalists when the Lawan campaign team visited him at his Abuja residence yesterday, Shettima said Senate Leader Lawan was the most qualified APC senator for the seat. “We are not at war with Sen. Ali Ndume; he is my kinsman but we will continue impressing on him to align himself with the aspiration of the party. We are not at war,” Shettima said. “Ordinarily, I am not even supposed to come here because there are three things to be combated. I hail from the same state with the distinguished Senator Ali Ndume, and I appreciate the fact that politics is local. But politics is also national. “I believe the blood that binds us together supersedes whatever we might harbour. But I fully align with the aspiration of my party, to the aspiration of President Muhammadu Buhari and by the grace of God, we are going to mobilize all our goodwill to see that we are fully on board. “We are for Sen. Ahmad Lawan and Femi Gbajabiamila and all other senators and other Reps members endorsed by the party. We are for party discipline that allowed everyone to aspire political offices. We believe that we must respect the party,” he said. Asked if he had met with Ndume on the matter, Shettima who is a senator-elect for Borno Central, said “l am the first citizen of the state, I have made wide consultations with our leaders from Borno before resolving to back Sen. Ahmad Lawan.”  Inside ‘mad dash’ for Senate presidency Most APC senators support Lawan to become Senate president — Sabi Senate Presidency: Sen. Lawan enjoys popular support – Group
