The Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Yekini Nabena, has warned that if the party does not get it right now on the zoning of key leadership positions in the ninth National Assembly, 2023 elections might turn out to be a free fall all in the ruling party.  Nabena, who gave the warning on Tuesday while speaking with journalists, called on the APC leadership to ensure that the zoning arrangement for the Senate President, Deputy Senate President, Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives in the incoming 9th National Assembly reflects the remaining four geopolitical regions of the country after the president and vice president had come from the North-west and South-west respectively.  The Bayelsa-born APC chieftain, who said the party’s National Working Committee (NWC) under the leadership of the APC National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, has already zoned the Senate Presidency to the North-east, recommended a zoning arrangement for the remaining positions.  He said, “The APC has elected National Assembly members from all geo-political zones of the country. Hence, the party’s leadership and indeed the presidency must take deliberate efforts to provide a fair and justifiable zoning arrangement for the 9th National Assembly leadership.
