The National Council on Privatisation (NCP) has granted approval to Diamond Stripes Consortium, Transcorp Power Consortium and Unicorn Consortium to proceed to the financial bids opening stage for the acquisition of 100 percent shares in the Afam Electricity Generation Company (Afam Power Plc & Afam Three Fast Power Limited). Rising from its first meeting for 2019, held on Friday, April 12, 2019 at the Presidential Villa, Aso Rock, Abuja, the Council noted that the two consortia met the benchmark score of 750 points after evaluation in accordance with the criteria set out in the Requests for Proposal (RfPs). Other decisions taken by the council include the approval for Quest Electric Nigeria Limited to proceed to the financial bids opening stage for the re-privatisation of the Yola Electricity Distribution Company (YEDC); appointment of Lead Capital Consortium as Financial Adviser for the restructuring, recapitalisation and partial privatisation of the Bank of Agriculture (BOA). According to spokesperson for the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) in a statement, other decisions taken include the delisting of Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja from post Privatisation monitoring by the BPE among others. It would be recalled that the privatisation of Afam Electricity Generation Company (Afam Power Plc & Afam Three Fast Power Limited) could not be concluded during the first round of the power privatization in 2013 due to issues stemming from gas supply to the plant.
