Two new attack helicopters have been inducted into the Nigerian Air Force fleet to bolster its combat capability. The induction of two Agusta 109 Power Helicopters into the Air Force fleet was the highlight of the 2019 NAF@55 celebrations at the Eagle square in Abuja yesterday. President Mohammadu Buhari, represented by Vice President Yemi Osinbanjo, said in less than four years, Nigeria has been able to revitalise its armed forces for the full restoration of Nigeria’s territorial integrity, which was once violated by Boko Haram insurgents. He added that, the procurement process of military hardware has been reviewed to remove inefficiency and corruption. He said, “This was in practical fulfillment of my promise to re-professionalise and adequately equip our military so that they could effectively discharge their responsibilities.” He said, “I have no doubt that the employment of the newly acquired platforms in addition to the Super Tucano aircraft which would be delivered in 2022, would add impetus to the combat efficiency of the Nigerian Air Force.” Earlier in his address, The Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar said the growth of the NAF since inception has been outstanding. He said from a few trainers and transport aircraft in the early years of the Service, the Nigerian Air Force currently has an impressive Order of Battle (ORBAT) comprising diverse aircrafts with capabilities to perform a wide spectrum of missions. 55th anniversary: President Buhari inducts 2 new attack helicopters for NAF Osinbajo: Crashed Helicopter not from NAF Osinbajo: Crashed Helicopter not from NAF
