Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has shortened his leave to return home and join major stakeholders in tackling the ongoing crisis around some border communities of the state. Our correspondent reports that renewed hostility between Jukuns of Wukari, a border local government area of Taraba State and Benueâ€™s rural communities in Ukum LGA have refused to cease as fighting which has led to several deaths continues in the affected environs while gunmen in alleged old communal disagreement in Kastina Ala LGA killed at least 11 people in the past three days. Ortom already on the way back to the country, as stated by his spokesman, Terver Akase, decided to cut short his leave as it became necessary, following the renewed killings of innocent people and destruction of property by gunmen, especially in the Sankera area of the state. The governor has appealed for calm and assured the people of the affected areas that his government would do everything lawfully possible to ensure the end of the crisis and to guarantee their safety. He said that it was part of the peace efforts that his deputy, Engr. Benson Abounu recently led a state delegation to Taraba to meet with key stakeholders in that state where they engaged on the best approach to end the lingering crisis between the people of border communities in the two states. Ortom added that even while on leave, he had been in constant touch with heads of security agencies in the state and quite optimistic that sooner than later, peace will return to the troubled areas.
