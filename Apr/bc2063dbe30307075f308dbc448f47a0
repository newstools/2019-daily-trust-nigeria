A victim of one-chance robbery in Abuja has narrated how he was robbed, beaten up and left to die by the syndicate. The victim, who asked for anonymity, told our reporter on his hospital bed that after several beatings, the robbers got all the money he had in his account. He said the incident happened around Minna Street, Area 8 in the capital city Wednesday night when he was going home after the evening Muslim prayers. He said he boarded a cab heading to Nyanya/Mararaba axis and upon getting inside the cab, one of the persons inside the cab told him, “We are armed robbers we are doing what we do best.” “They were holding all sorts of ammunition such as guns, knives and hammer. They collected all ATM cards with me. They brutalized me, used the hammer on me despite cooperating with them. They even threatened to eliminate me,” he said, adding that he had over N300,000 in the ATM cards, of which he was forced to give the PIN to them. He said the Minna Street where the incident happened was dark, quiet with no street lights functioning. He said he was later dumped around the Kubwa express road after they (robbers) had contemplated whether to take him to one ‘Mallam’ (presumably for rituals) but decided against it. He added that a taxi driver later came to his rescue and took him to his sister’s house. Meanwhile, the spokesman of the FCT Police Command, ASP Gajere T. Danjuma, said the command has been recording successes in flushing the city of one-chance robbers and other criminals. He said all the one-chance robbery suspects arrested last month had since been arraigned before the court. “We have put up several strategies, which include the stationing of several RRS vehicles at strategic places in the city,” he added.
