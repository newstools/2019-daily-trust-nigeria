The Ogun State Governor-elect, Prince Dapo Abiodun, yesterday, gave condition that will make him continue implementing the projects he will inherit from the outgoing Governor, Sen. Ibikunle Amosun. Prince Abiodun said the projects “must have a clear line sight to uplift Ogun State and benefit the people.” He said this in Ogere-Remo in Ikenne Local Government Area while inaugurating a 23-man Economic Transition Committee to be led by Tunde Lemo and a 235-member work groups. Prince Abiodun, an oil magnate, who admitted that “government is a continuum”, expressed hope that the outgoing governor “would provide to us timeously accurate information on all the ongoing projects in the state and the general state of affairs of our common patrimony.” Abiodun equally told the committee members that, “There should be a compelling reason to tweak any of the items” on the terms of reference, just as he expressed confidence that “the most suited” committee members would deliver on the objectives of the assignment. He, therefore, asked them “to elaborate on the campaign manifesto, identify and distil the pressing needs of the state and our people, recommend specific programmes and policies and develop a measurable and realistic roadmap, including identifying low hanging fruits, for implementation.” He added that, “I am conscious of the fact that the expectations from the next administration under my watch are high and that people have become cynical of government and the political class in general. “And the task is not made easier by paucity of funds. Nonetheless, the incoming administration is determined to make a difference and provide leadership that earns the confidence of the people; a government that has character and can be trusted.”  Ogun: Abiodun gives condition to implement Amosun's projects Ogun APC slams Amosun, says he deserves sympathy 'APC will win governorship poll without Governor Amosun'
