Aggrieved residents of 10 communities, hosting railway station in Abeokuta, Ogun State, on Saturday, disrupted the activities of the officials of China Civil Engineering Construction Company at the construction of Lagos-Ibadan Standard gauge rail project, citing alleged neglect of their deplorable road by the contractor for their action. They also used their cars to block the trains conveying construction materials to press home their grievances against the company. The affected communities are, Liberty, Jaguna, Ori, Oloruntedo, Elefun, Bashorun, Ifesowapo, Agunrete, Surulere, Olorunsogo and Jangede. Speaking during the protest, Chairman of Ori/Oshoko community, Egbeyemi Olakunle said they blocked the railway to show their grievances. He lamented that the communities had been neglected. He said “we have actually started road block to show our grievances so that they can attend to the problem we have in the community.” Reacting to the protest, the Public Relations Officer of the CCECC, Musa Abdullahi said “There is actually a protest, no doubt, but, for me, it’s just a little misunderstanding between the community and the company. “What they are demanding for is actually their right, but the point is nobody told us about it. “The very moment the management got to know of it, we swung into action.” Rail project: 70 communities ‘cut off’ in Ogun demand road, bridge Abuja light rail: Dec deadline no longer feasible –NRC Women shut Shell gas plant over power outage
