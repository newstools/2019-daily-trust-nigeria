President Muhammadu Buhari, has described Governor Ibrahim Shettima’s Industrial park project as a realistic one, during his one day official visit to Maiduguri the Borno state capital.  Buhari, who arrived the city at 10:36am, was welcomed by the Governor Kashim Shettima and other government officials before he proceeded to various places across Maiduguri where housing estates, mega schools, industries among others, were built by the state government.  As part of its far reaching responses to the recovery of Borno’s economy in the face of huge setbacks caused by the Boko Haram, the Kashim Shettima administration initiated a bold and ambitious project of constructing an Industrial Park in Maiduguri.  The Industrial Park which has 16 plants, has a solar panel production plant with optimum capacity to annually produce panels that can generate 120 megawatts. It was designed for the localization of factories that share resources such as raw materials, electricity, security amongst others with room for attraction of more industries in future.  President Buhari whose face lit up with smiles while commissioning the project, said: “This is a realistic project.”  For a start, the Industrial Parkland will be used for manufacturing different products that are mostly agric-related.  Though each of the 16 plants manufacture different products, some of them are assembled to share one factory hall under a modern integrated concept that ensures efficient space and other resource utilization.
