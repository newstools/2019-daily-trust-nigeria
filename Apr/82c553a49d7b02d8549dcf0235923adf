Ghana has launched a drone service to deliver medicine to remote parts of the country that are hard to reach by road. President Nana Akufo-Addo described the initiative as a major step towards giving every Ghanaian access to life-saving medicine. A US-based company, Zipline, is behind the project and is due to be paid $12m for the service for the next four years. Some politicians have opposed the project, arguing that the money would be better spent on clinics and ambulances.
