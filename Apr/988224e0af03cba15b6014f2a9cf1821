The Federal Capital Territory  Administration (FCTA) Department of Development Control has said all illegal structures in ECOWAS Estate at Katampe extension would be demolished. City News gathered that residents of the estate had petitioned the FCT minister over illegal structures springing up in the estate. The director, Development Control, Mukhtar Galadima, after inspecting the estate at the weekend, confirmed that he had personally come to see the situation, saying there was much work to be done and that all those claiming to have allocations for plots must produce them with proof. On his part, the director, Building Inspectorate,  Abdullahi Umar, said the buildings were illegal and vowed that the departments were coming to demolish them very soon. “Those claims of plot approvals cannot be true. They are fake as we can recognise green areas,” he added. He said the ECOWAS Estate at Diplomatic Zone, Katampe Extension, was originally built for ECOWAS staff on owner occupier basis because the environment was considered to be serene enough for elite settlement. The chairman of the estate, Mr. Dennis Eboreime, said if they kept quiet, the place would become a slum. He assured that the estate association would not allow illegal builders to constitute nuisance to residents.
