The Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal in Sokoto State has given the candidate of the APC, Ahmad Aliyu Sokoto, and his party the leave to serve Gov. Aminu Tambuwal through substituted means. It also granted the applicantsâ€™ prayer to physically inspect materials, photocopy some of them, and obtain true certified copies used by INEC for the conduct of the March 9, governorship election and March 23, supplementary governorship poll in the state. On the substituted service, Lead Counsel to the petitioners/applicants, Barr. Steve Nwoke, told the tribunal that it had been difficult to physically serve Gov. Tambuwal a copy of the petition challenging the outcome of the elections. In his ruling, Chairman of the tribunal, Justice Abbas Bawale Abdullahi, stated that the tribunal had carefully perused the applications and that they had merit. He, therefore, granted the prayer of the applicants. Justice Abdullahi gave the applicants leave to serve Gov. Tambuwal the petition through the state Legal Adviser of the PDP. Similarly, the chairman granted Gov. Tambuwal and the PDP leave to inspect election materials, as well as invite forensic experts to conduct physical inspection of materials used for the elections and obtain true certified copies of documents. Lead Counsel to the respondent/applicant, Barr. Muktar Mahmuda Yabo, made the application.
