The Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) has convicted suspended Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Walter Onnoghen, accused of false and non-declaration of assets. The tribunal chairman, Danladi Umar, while giving judgement in the case on Thursday, held that the prosecution had proven the case beyond reasonable doubt. Umar held that Onnoghen is convicted as follows: Before his punishments were read to him, the tribunal gave opportunity for allocutus. However, counsel to Onnoghen, Okon Efut (SAN), said the defence had nothing to say. When tribunal asked Onnoghen if he has anything to say, he said “My Lord, I don’t”.
