Former Vice-President Joe Biden has denied allegations of misconduct ahead of his widely-expected announcement of a presidential run. Lucy Flores, a former Nevada Assembly member, says Mr Biden kissed her on the back of her head at a campaign event. “I had never experienced anything so blatantly inappropriate,” she wrote. Mr Biden said he had shown “expressions of affection” to people over the years, adding “not once – never – did I believe I acted inappropriately”. “If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully,” he said. Serving as Barack Obama’s vice-president for eight years and in the US Senate for nearly four decades, Mr Biden is seen as a possible frontrunner in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.
