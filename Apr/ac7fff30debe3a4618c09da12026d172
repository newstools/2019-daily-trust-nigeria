The Lagos State chapter of the PDP, yesterday, commenced move to reposition the party for future electoral victories after a critical review of its 2019 election performance. The party said it has learnt its lessons and resolved to entrench discipline by collapsing groups and factions in the party into one united family. But of particular importance is the restructuring of the party to conform to the existing structure of 20 Local Government Areas (LGAs) and 37 Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs) of the state. Leaders and elders of the party made these resolutions after a meeting held at the party secretariat where they also declared that there was no crisis within the party. Apart from losing the governorship election, the party did not win any seat in the 40-member House of Assembly unlike in 2015 when it won eight seats. It however won three out of the 24 House of Representatives seats in the state. The state party chairman, Dr. Adegbola Dominic, who spoke at the meeting attended by many elders and leaders of the party, said it was resolved that “it is unrealistic and unwise for our party to be administered on the basis of 20 local government areas in Lagos State, while the APC and other parties are operating 57 LGA party structures.” Daily Trust reports that though the Nigerian Constitution recognizes 20 LGs, 57 LGs are enshrined in the law of Lagos State following the creation of 37 LCDAs by ex-Governor Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. However, Lagos PDP believes operating on the 20 LGAs structure would continually put the party at a disadvantaged position. “The State CWC has therefore resolved and recommended the restructuring of our party administration to conform with the 57 LGA structure. A special committee has been put in place to work out the modalities for implementation of these reforms”, Dominic said. AD steadily sliding into oblivion?
