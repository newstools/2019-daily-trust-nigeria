Millions of people have voted in Turkey’s local elections, which are widely seen as a referendum on President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Early reports say the main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) has a narrow lead in Ankara. In Istanbul, the result is too close to call – but some reports are putting the governing AK Party ahead. More than 57 million were registered to vote for mayors and councillors. The poll came amidst an economic downturn. The country is in recession, inflation is at 20% and the lira has plunged by a third in value. Mr Erdogan said the poll was about the “survival” of the country and his AK Party (Justice and Development Party, AKP), the dominant party for 16 years. It was the first municipal vote since Mr Erdogan assumed sweeping executive powers through last year’s presidential election.
