A three-man panel of the Court of Appeal in Ibadan headed by Justice Nonyerem Okoronkwo yesterday struck out a motion filed by Senator Rashidi Ladoja challenging the powers of Governor Abiola Ajimobi of Oyo State to approve beaded crowns and coronets to 48 monarchs across the state. Gov Ajimobi had appealed the January 20, 2018 decision of Justice Olajumoke Aiki of the Oyo State High Court which set aside the recommendation of a committee of inquiry on the review of the 1957 Ibadan Chieftaincy declaration that recommended the crowning of 21 new monarchs in Ibadanland. Other members of the panel are Justice A. Talba and Justice F. Ojo. The panel held that the gazette, which sought the court to set aside the motion, was not the subject matter at the lower court. Okoronkwo said that dealing with such an issue at this point may involve dwelling into the main appeal. “We refuse to entertain the issue and urge the appellant to incorporate it in the main appeal. The motion is hereby struck out,” the judge said and adjourned the matter until May 27, 2019 for hearing of the main appeal. Gov Ajimobi had set up a commission of inquiry headed by Justice Akintunde Boade to review the 1957 Ibadan Chieftaincy Declaration and to make recommendations. But the Osi Olubadan, High Chief Rashid Ladoja, challenged the composition of the committee at the Oyo State High Court.
