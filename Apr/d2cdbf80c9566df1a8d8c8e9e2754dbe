Daily Trust gathered that the old man and his son were arrested on Tuesday around 5:00pm at the palace of the District Head of Rigachikun. Abdulhamidu Ibrahim, the youngest son of the old man while narrating to Daily Trust how his father and brother were arrested, said: “They were arrested on Tuesday when some elders in the community invited them to the District Head’s palace for settlement on how to recover the cows. “While they were there, the police took them away and detained them. They were simply arrested for insisting to recover our 31 cows missing in police custody and for telling the media about it,” he alleged. He said ever since their father and elder brother Habu granted interview on the missing cows, the police have been threatening them.
