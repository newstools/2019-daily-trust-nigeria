The commander in charge of the military prison at Guantanamo Bay has been dismissed just seven weeks before he was due to leave the post. Navy Rear Admiral John Ring was fired due to a “loss of confidence in his ability to command,” according to the US Southern Command. Rear Adm Ring will be temporarily assigned elsewhere in the Southern Command, which oversees the prison. His deputy, Army Brig General John Hussey, will serve as acting commander.
