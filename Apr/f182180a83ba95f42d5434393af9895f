Oil major, 11plc, formerly Mobil Oil Nigeria Plc, has intensified its social investment scheme with the renovation of  two building structures consisting of  21 classrooms at Baptist Primary School, Marine Beach, Apapa Local Government Area, Lagos State as part of its corporate social responsibility initiatives   in its host community. The multi million naira infrastructure upgrade which was embarked upon as part of the company’s cardinal programme of giving back to the communities where it operates has been handed over to the state government through the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB). The decision of the oil firm to once again intervene in the development of  Apapa  Local Government and its environs, according to a statement, followed an appeal from the school to carry out the rehabilitation of their building through Marine Beach Community head, their counselor and representatives of the local government who visited 11Plc office on the issue. Baptist Primary School  is within Apapa LGA and was   in a very deplorable  state with 80- 90 per cent of the building roofing sheets blown up leaving the upper floor of the three storey structure out of use and the walls in dire need of repainting . The pupils of the school and teachers alike were said to be having a hard time coping with the rigors of using the facility thus inhibiting conducive learning opportunities in the school. The Managing Director 11Plc, Mr Adetunji Oyebanji, said the company took the opportunity to rehabilitate the school on four different fronts namely: giving back to the host community; creating a conducive learning environment for the pupils and other stakeholders; responding positively to the request of the community heads and government agencies; and avenue to the company’s positive contributions to its customers and community to reinforce its brand equity and corporate image. He pointed out that the school is not only popular within the company’s immediate community as it is one of the biggest in the local government area and operated since the 1960s, stressing that the gesture would go a long way in deepening and reinforcing the harmonious relationship between 11PLC  and her host community as well as government agencies .
