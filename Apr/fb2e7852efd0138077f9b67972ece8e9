Governor Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa State says the flagbearer of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who will succeed him as governor from the November 2 governorship election will emerge through prayers and consultations. Governor Dickson stated this while speaking at the Monthly Praise Night and the 8th edition of the Easter Cantata programme organised by the government in Yenagoa on Saturday night. Special Adviser to the governor on Media Relations Mr. Fidelis Soriwei, in a statement yesterday, quoted the governor as stressing the need for all well-meaning Bayelsans and friends of the state to pray for its continued stability and peace. He also urged the people to seek the face of God for his divine direction as the PDP embarked on the search for the next governor of the state. According to the governor, his position on who succeeded him was anchored on the belief that God does not only give power but truly rule in the affairs of men. He expressed gratitude to the clergy and people of the state for their prayers and support in the past seven years, and attributed his achievements in office to the mercies of God. He said: “I will not cease thanking God and you the clergymen and indeed the good people of our state for the prayers and encouragement and support you are giving to me and my team.” Bayelsa guber: How the winner will emerge Bayelsa guber: How the winner will emerge Bayelsa guber: How the winner will emerge
