The Nigerian Council of Physicians of Natural Medicine (NCPNM) has inducted five members as fellows and another two as members of the council to help move natural medicine practice forward in the FCT. The National President of NCPNM, Prof. Baderinwa Adewale, enjoined practitioners to work in unity and speak with one voice, adding that the practice of medicine should not be with rivalry, but that it should be complementary and that that was why there was complementary segment of the council. Prof. Adewale said, “The ability to cure patients is what makes you a doctor and not what you have gathered over the years. The FCT is big and we need to make natural medicine viable here too… and we are glad that the Federal Government has recognised the practice of natural medicine in line with the recommendation of the World Health Organisation (WHO) to make it part of the healthcare system thereby creating a department: Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicine (TICAM), at the Federal Ministry of Health.” The inductees were Doctors Onipinshaiye Jonathan, Aderele Adedapo, Afonja Adewale, Rantiola Ogun and  Bamilore Moses, while the new members were Doctors Kaka Goni and Hussaini Ibrahim. One of the inductees and the Medical Director of Living Spice Nature Cure Hospital, Abuja, Dr. Onipinshaiye, who lauded the effort of the government for creating a department to handle traditional medicine, said, we should emulate other countries that have gone far in the use of natural herbs for treating ailments.
