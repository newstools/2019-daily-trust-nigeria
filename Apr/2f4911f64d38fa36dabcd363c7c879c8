The Supreme Court on Friday failed to confirm reports of the resignation of the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen.  The office of the Chief Registrar, Uwani Mustapha and the Director of Information in the apex court, Dr Festus Akande told Daily Trust that the reports are “still mere rumours”.  But a reliable source, who is close to the CJN, informed Daily Trust that the CJN’s resignation is being anticipated.  “He was expected to send in the letter on Thursday, so we are not surprised if he has,” the source said under condition of anonymity.  But Dr Akande said a resignation letter would not be forwarded without knowledge of the Supreme Court and the National Judicial Council (NJC).  Akande added however that “Of course if I get any contrary information, I will let you know.”  The NJC on Wednesday forwarded its report on the petition against Justice Onnoghen by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to President Muhammadu Buhari to act upon.  The council declined to make their findings public. NJC forms fresh panel over Onnoghen, Mohammed Agbakoba sues AGF over Onnoghen's suspension Onnoghen: NJC declines action, sends report to Buhari
