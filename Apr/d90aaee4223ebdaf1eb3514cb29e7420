The Aldo of Kujama in Kajuru Local Government Area of Kaduna State, Alhaji Idris Gunderi, weekend said over 74,000 cattle were rustled across Kaduna State in four years. He said the owners of those cattle were left without compensation nor assistance from both state and federal governments. Fielding questions from newsmen in Kaduna, he said he had the list of those affected. He said government must find a way to assist those whose cows were stolen as a way of providing succour to them. “Nothing was given to the Fulanis who own those cattle not even a mudu of maize as government assistance.  It’s unfortunate the kind of situation our people find themselves‎,” he said. He alleged that cattle rustling had continued without any serious measures to curtail it. He also decried the failure to prosecute culprits. 74,000 cattle rustled in four years in Kaduna INVESTIGATION: 322 herders killed, 60,000 cattle rustled in 2013 322 herders killed, 60,000 cattle rustled in 2013
