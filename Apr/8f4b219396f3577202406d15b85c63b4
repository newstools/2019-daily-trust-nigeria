A group under the aegis of Faculty Board of Initiatives, comprising former and serving lawmakers, has warned against the imposition of presiding officers on the incoming 9th assembly. The group said the lawmakers themselves “should be allowed to choose their own leaders without interference from government, political parties or other entities.” Spokesman of the group and former chairman of House Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Eseme Eyiboh, gave the warning yesterday during a media briefing in Abuja. Eyibo, on behalf of the group, urged the lawmakers to resist imposition and instead begin a talent hunt among themselves for the best Senate president and speaker of the House of Representatives. Members present at the hearing included Nelson Alapa,  Chris Eta, Ibrahim Buba, Chukwuemeka Ujam, among others.
