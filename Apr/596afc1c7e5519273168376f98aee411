The Nigeria Air Force investigative panel on alleged killing of civilians during an arial bombardment have arrived Katsina and Zamfara states to unravel the true situation. Briefing newsmen on their arrival at the Umaru Musa Yar’adua Airport, the chairman of the seven-man panel, Air Vice Marshal IG Lubo, said the panel was scheduled to meet with all stakeholders involved, be it family of victims, emirs and traditional rulers and officers carrying out the operation with a view to setting the records straight. He said the NAF was disturbed when the allegation was raised, adding, “by next week, my report should be ready.” “When allegations are made, the COAS is someone who believes in the right thing to be done and asked us to come and do a through investigation on the matter” he added. He added: “If such indeed happened the airforce will not hesitate to admit, we are here to bring peace to the entire North West region. We want to see if it is true on how we can change tactics to ensure that the right thing is done, fighting in built-up areas is a difficult position, these bandits, hoodlums are taking advantage of our civilian populace who are innocent in nature by mixing with them and you cannot rule out mistakes happening but then our board will uncover this.” “No soldier wants to kill anyone that is innocent, I would rather have a criminal go scout free than kill one innocent civilian, I’m a trained pilot and a soldier,” he added.
