It comes with an extensive range of mechanical and technological features and comfort upgrades. “The current Ranger has been a fantastic success story for Ford in Sub-Saharan Africa, and is the leading LCV export to markets in Europe, the Middle East and the rest of Africa,” General Manager Marketing at Ford Motor Company Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) Region, Doreen Mashinini, said in a statement. Mashinini added that “The new Ranger introduces fresh exterior and interior design cues that build on its ‘tough truck’ image, complemented by the adoption of new technologies that further bolster the Ranger’s established reputation for supreme safety, convenience and comfort.” Speaking on the new Ranger, the General Manager, Marketing and Corporate Communication at Coscharis Motors (the exclusive distributors of Ford in Nigeria), Abiona Babarinde, stressed that, “The new Ford will bring more value to its numerous customers in Nigeria.” Babarinde said, “We are excited about this new addition to our Ford collection; that will certainly deliver the expected value in the auto market, as this is expected to delight our numerous existing customers and convert new prospects in the truck segment. “Surprisingly, some of our loyal customers have already started to make enquiries on this new Ranger; which is a good signal that this vehicle will be well accepted and will do well in our market.” Ford opens dealership shop in Abuja Ford to assemble Ranger van in Lagos before December Ford Motor launches Ranger XL-Plus
