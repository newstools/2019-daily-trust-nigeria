Spain’s Socialists are considering their next move after failing to gain a majority in Sunday’s general election. Pedro Sanchez’s party won the poll with 29% of the vote. But he must join forces with either left-wing Podemos and other regional parties or the centre right if he decides to form a coalition government. However, fellow Socialist and Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo said in a radio interview that the party would try to govern on its own. She said: “We have more than enough to steer this ship along the course it must follow.”  21 parties adopt Gov Bello ahead of Saturday polls VENEZUELA: President Maduro bars opposition from next year''s vote French premier pledges reimbursement for football trip on public jet
