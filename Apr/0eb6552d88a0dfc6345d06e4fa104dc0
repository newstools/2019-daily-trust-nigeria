A gateman has rejected a house offer as a parting gift from his boss whom he served for 25 years. He, instead, requested that a borehole be sunk for his community which he said lacked water. Musa Usman, from Giljimmi, a Fulani settlement in Birniwa Local Government Area of Jigawa State, lives with his family in a thatched house. Usman, who had served the Indian national, Mr. V. Verghese, who is also the Managing Director of a pharmaceutical company, Jawa International Limited in Lagos, for 25 years, left the service in order to reunite with his family in the village. When Usman was leaving, Verghese offered to build a house for him to appreciate his diligence while he was his gateman. People in Usman’s community were previously trekking a long distance for water. Speaking at the commissioning of the borehole, Verghese said his decision for the parting gift was borne out of a high degree of honesty exhibited by Usman while he was working with him. He said: “Musa has served me diligently for 25 years. We would travel to India and leave our house under his care and behold, we would meet everything intact. He is indeed an honest Nigerian.” Usman, thanked Verghese for the gesture, saying he had no regret substituting the house offer with community borehole.
