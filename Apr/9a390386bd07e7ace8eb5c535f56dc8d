The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) says it has implemented 29 out of 37 safety recommendations issued it by the Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB). The recommendations emanated from investigation of various investigations conducted into past air accidents. AIB after releasing final report of accident usually issues safety recommendations to various stakeholders including the NCAA with a view to preventing recurrence of such accident or incident. Daily Trust reports that since inception, AIB as a body has issued over 130 safety recommendations to the concerned airlines, aircraft manufacturers and NCAA among others. Director General of the NCAA Capt. Muhtar Usman disclosed that out of the total 37 safety recommendations issued to NCAA, 29 were fully implemented, two partially implemented and one yet to be implemented. He however said NCAA did not agree with the remaining five. He also disclosed that the authority would soon certify Nigeria’s foremost airline, Air Peace, to commence international operations, saying the airline has almost fulfilled the requirements for the certification. In an interview with newsmen on the sidelines of the AIB stakeholders’ forum on review of accident investigation, Usman explained that the authority had duly briefed the bureau on why some of the recommendations were not implementable. He said NCAA had forwarded the status of implementation of the three outstanding safety recommendations to a ministerial committee set up by the Federal Government to look into implementation of safety recommendations as issued by AIB. He said: “There are rules to making safety recommendations. Safety recommendations are meant to address specific concerns. Sometimes active, sometimes proactive, but they have to be implementable.
