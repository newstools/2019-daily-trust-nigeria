The APC and the PDP in Sokoto State are trading blames over alleged plans to burn the INEC office in the state. The APC first raised an alarm over alleged plans by those it described as “mischievous elements” to set the state headquarters of INEC ablaze. This was contained in a statement by the state Publicity Secretary of the party, Sambo Bello Danchadi, and made available to journalists in Sokoto. The statement read in part: “The purpose of this nefarious action is to destroy all the available evidences that will be required in the ongoing Sokoto State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal.” The APC said it viewed the development with serious concern, noting that “it is intended to derail the course of justice, negatively impact on our nascent democracy and endanger peace and unity in our dear state.” However, the PDP urged security agencies to secure the INEC office and the election materials domiciled there. The PDP expressed concern over the alarm raised by the APC on a possible plan to burn down the INEC office. In a statement signed by the state Chairman of PDP, Alhaji Ibrahim Milgoma, he said such allegation needed to be taken seriously by all security agencies. “This is considering the serious implications of that possibility to the ongoing election cases before the courts, most of which the PDP instituted,” he said. “We, therefore, demand that security agencies should not only be on extra alert to secure the INEC headquarters from such infringement, but also to investigate the matter, with the assistance of the APC, who claim to have information on the threat,” he added.
