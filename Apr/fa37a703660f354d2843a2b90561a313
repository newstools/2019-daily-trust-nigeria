Egyptians have approved in a referendum constitutional changes that could allow President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi to stay in power until 2030. The National Election Authority said 88.8% of those who took part endorsed the proposals. The turnout was 44.3%. Mr Sisi’s second term has been extended from four to six years, and he will be allowed to seek one more term in 2024. The changes also expand the military’s power to intervene in politics and give Mr Sisi more power over the judiciary. In 2013, Mr Sisi led the military’s overthrow of Egypt’s first democratically elected president, Mohammed Morsi, following protests against his rule.
