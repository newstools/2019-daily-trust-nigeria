The Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has disclosed that MainOne and Google have invested $20 million for the development of terrestrial fibre infrastructure in the state. Gov. Obaseki made the disclosure in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), after attending the ninth edition of the Annual Investment Meeting (AIM) themed: “Mapping the Future of Foreign Direct Investment: Enriching World Economies through Digital Globalisation.” In an interview, the governor said Edo was being positioned to be the digital hub for the South South. “Today, we have an innovation hub, we are partnering with technology companies. But what is even more important is that we are working with Google and MainOne. “We are constructing about 400 kilometres of fibre in Edo as we speak. In the next couple of months, it should be ready for commissioning. Don’t forget that we also have energy; we have a lot of oil and gas and therefore we are building power plants. Outside Azura, we are also building another 55MW of power. With electricity and fibre, we are 50 per cent there. “All we need to do is to get the content providers, get our educational system to be in tuned. Google and MainOne, I think they have invested in excess of $20m,” he said. At the event, President Muhammadu Buhari delivered a keynote speech. On the AIM, the Edo governor said,” The global economic growth now is coming more from the digital transactions from digital economies and it’s important that emerging markets key in. So this summit is very apt to profit on our future.”  MainOne, Facebook spent $20m on Edo fiber- Gov Obaseki Every Nigerian deserves Internet connectivity – Opeke I’ll not retrench workers – Obaseki
