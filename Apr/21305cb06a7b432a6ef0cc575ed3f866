Ogun state Governor-elect, Prince Dapo Abiodun on Wednesday gave condition that would make him continue the implementation of projects to be inherited from the outgoing Governor, Senator Ibkunle Amosun’s government. Those projects, he submitted, “must have a clear line of sight to the upliftment of Ogun state and benefits to the people.” He spoke on Wednesday in Ogere-Remo, Ikenne local government area, while inaugurating Tunde Lemo-led 23-man Economic Transition Committee and the 235-member Work Groups. The oil magnate who admitted that “government is a continuum”, expressed hope that the outgoing governor “would provide to us timely and accurate information on all the ongoing projects in the state and the general state of affairs of our common patrimony.” Abiodun equally told the committee members that “there should be a compelling reason to tweak any of the items” on the Terms of Reference, just as he expressed confidence that “the most suited” committee members would deliver on the objectives of the assignment. He asked them “to elaborate on the campaign manifesto, identify and distil the pressing needs of the state and our people, recommend specific programmes and policies and develop a measurable and realistic roadmap, including identifying low hanging fruits, for implementation.” “I am conscious of the fact that the expectations from the next administration under my watch are high and that people have become cynical of government and the political class in general. “And the task is not made easier by paucity of funds. Nonetheless, the incoming administration is determined to make a difference and provide leadership that earns the confidence of the people, a government that has character and can be trusted,” the governor-elect said.
