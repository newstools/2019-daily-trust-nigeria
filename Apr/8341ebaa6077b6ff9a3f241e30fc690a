The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) on Thursday said its Air Task Force (ATF) for Operation Lafiya Dole has destroyed some vehicles and neutralized some Boko Haram Terrorists (BHTs) at a suspected vehicle workshop in Sambisa Forest, Borno State.   The spokesman of the NAF, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola said the operation was conducted yesterday, 24 April 2019, after a Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platform on a routine mission observed significant activities as well as some serviceable vehicles.   He said the vehicles were hidden under some trees at a previously abandoned BHT vehicle workshop, adding that, the ATF scrambled an Alpha Jet to attack the location.   He said overhead the target area, some of the BHT fighters were seen attempting to flee the location but were taken out by the Alpha Jetâ€™s successful strikes, which also caused the destruction of two vehicles and other equipment at the workshop.   He said the NAF, operating in concert with surface forces, will sustain its operations to completely degrade the terrorists in the Northeast.
