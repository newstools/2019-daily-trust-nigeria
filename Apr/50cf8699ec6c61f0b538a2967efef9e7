It was further gathered that a mosque belonging to the Nasrul Lahi L Fatih Society (NASFAT) Education Centre in the area was vandalised. Daily Trust learnt that the Hausa boys involved in the attack were labourers, looking for menial jobs who usually gathered at  Egba junction, waiting for someone to hire them.
