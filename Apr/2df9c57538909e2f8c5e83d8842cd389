Senator Ilechukwu Obiorah has described as “blatant falsehood” reports linking him with the controversial Malabu oil deal In a statement issue on Thursday in Abuja, Sen Obiorah urged the public to disregard the malicious publication as well as the other fake news sponsored and published against him since 2005. The statement reads in part, “My Attention has been drawn to a publication maliciously linking me to the Malabu Oil controversy. The fact is that I sold to one Alhaji A.A Aliyu (AA Oil) my two Plots No 279 with file No. MISC 51501 and 280 with file No: MISC 52560, situate at the Central Business District Abuja, adjacent to Ceddi Plaza, together with the owning companies namely Touchstone Ltd RC No. 407140 and Hentom and Co Ltd RC No.199446 respectively.” “The above sale was done in the open market after I left the Senate in 2011 and with the processes necessary for the transfer of the companies to A.A Aliyu registered contemporaneously at the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). The foregoing facts are easily verifiable.”  Malabu deal: I acted on Jonathan’s instruction - Adoke Why FG helped make Etete $1bn richer …And how Mohammed Abacha, Hassan Adamu, and Atiku’s associates lost out Jonathan: I didn’t receive $200m from Malabu deal
