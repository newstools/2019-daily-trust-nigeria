Some newly elected APC members of the House of Representatives from the North West have adopted Kawu Sumaila for the position to be allocated to the zone by the ruling party. The APC is said to be considering zoning the position of deputy speaker to the zone. The newly elected members were said to have agreed to back the candidacy of Sumaila from Kano State. Hon. Suleiman Abdulrahman Kawu Sumaila has been elected to represent Sumaila/Takai Federal Constituency, Kano State. Until January, he was the Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly Matters (House of Representatives). The move by the newly elected members is seen as a pre-emptive step to tie the hands of their older colleagues who are also interested in presenting one of them to run for the position. The newly elected members met in Kaduna for several hours and took the decision. National Coordinator of the forum of the newly elected APC members, Ibrahim Al-Mustapha Aliyu, told newsmen after the meeting in Kaduna that they decided to back Sumaila due to his experience as a legislator. Aliyu said, “North West’s new members have endorsed and aligned with the position of the party on the leadership structure of the 9th Assembly.” Rep Da’u joins race for deputy speaker 2019: Buhari needs tough legislatures to accomplish peoples’ mandates, says Kawu Sumaila Lawmaker seeks support for Dakingari
