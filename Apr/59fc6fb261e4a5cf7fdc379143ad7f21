The Rivers State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has berated the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)’s timelines for  the collation of the March 9 governorship election in Rivers State. INEC, at a stakeholders meeting in Port Harcourt  announced that it would conclude collation of governorship election in six local government areas (LGAs) of the state today. The State APC Publicity Secretary, Chris Finebone, in a statement issued in Port Harcourt yesterday said, “it is a mere charade, well-organised and choreographed by the INEC in its bid to work from answer to question. “The ultimate result of the collation can only be to announce their preferred partner and collaborator as winner against the AAC candidate, Engr Biokpomabo Awara, who was clearly in the lead before collation was aborted.” Finebone alleged that several actions of INEC had prepared the minds of many that the entire exercise was skewed to favour Governor  Nyesom Wike and the PDP. He wondered where the result sheets and other sensitive materials involved in the collation process had been kept since they were not returned to the Central Bank for safe-keeping. “How come that Governor Wike knew about the 17 LGAs whose results had been allegedly collated and had posted same on his official Twitter handle long before INEC made the announcement? Answers to these and other questions will continue to hang on the neck of INEC like an albatross. “The truth is that what is happening now is in complete fulfilment of the tripartite collaboration between Wike, the INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner, ably assisted by the Administrative Secretary of INEC in Rivers State,” he stated.
