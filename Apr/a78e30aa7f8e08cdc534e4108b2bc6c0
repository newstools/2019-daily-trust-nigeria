The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the recently held general elections, Atiku Abubakar has denied spending the sum of $30, 000 to hire a US lobby group to persuade the US Congress to stop the second term inauguration of President Muhmadu Buhari on May 29, 2019. Atiku, a former vice president, who described the allegation as a dirty propaganda, fabricated and aimed at blackmailing him, said it was handiwork of the Buhari Campaign Organisation. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had declared the candidate of the APC, President Buhari as winner of the February 23, election but Atiku is challenging the outcome of the election in court. Atiku, in a statement on Wednesday by his Special Adviser on Media, Paul Ibe, said the $30,000 allegation was a “shameless lie” which came as a surprise to him. “Lying has become a culture to the APC administration and therefore, we are not surprised by their latest diversionary allegations. “Since Atiku resisted pressure not to go to court, the APC has been behaving like a cat on hot bricks because the outcome of the 2019 elections has exposed and shattered the facade of their dubious integrity. “The APC are behaving nervously like a thief living under the fear of being exposed and shamed, and that they are now using fake news against Atiku instead of focusing on defending themselves in the court. “For a party that has broken the worst record in election rigging, the APC doesn’t have any iota of integrity to be taken seriously by anybody,” he said. …Presidency spent billions to stop Atiku's US trip - PDP I will end Zamfara killings within 30 days- Atiku (VIDEO) 2019: BMO hails US group’s victory prediction for Buhari
