The West Africa Network for Peacebuilding (WANEP-Nigeria) has commended a group of women who led indigenes of Zamfara States resident in Abuja, to protest the protracted killings in the state by bandits, which forced the federal government to take some decisive actions. The National Coordinator, WANEP, Chief Bridget Osakwe, at a Media Round-table on United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325 and Women, Peace and Security (WPS) Resolution in Nigeria, on Wednesday in Abuja, commended the women for adopting a non-violence but effective approach that yielded results. Daily Trust reports that the indigenes of Zamfara State residing in the FCT, at the protest last Saturday, decried the insecurity in the state which has resulted in apprehension, displacements of communities and loss of lives. They also urged President Muhammadu Buhari to urgently intervene and halt the killings and kidnappings ravaging the state. The convener of the protest, Miss Fatimah Mustapha said that their action was to call the attention of government to the ongoing and protracted gruesome killings and kidnappings in Zamfara.
