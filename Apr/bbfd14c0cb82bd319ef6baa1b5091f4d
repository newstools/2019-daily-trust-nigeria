A Member of the House of Representatives, John Dyegh (APC, Benue), yesterday, formally declared interest to contest for the position of the Speaker of the 9th House. This came few hours after the leadership of the APC adopted House Leader, Femi Gabajabiamila (APC, Lagos), for the same position. Hon. Dyegh, who made his declaration in Abuja, acknowledged his loyalty to the APC, but said his North Central was neither convinced nor given reasons as to why the position should be ceded to the South West that already had the vice president. “I hereby declare my intention to vie for the position of Speaker of the 9th House of Representatives. The decision is based on my unyielding faith in a united and prosperous Nigeria,” he said. “My party, the APC zoned the position to the South West. My loyalty to the APC is 100 per cent. However, the North Central has not been convinced nor given reasons why the position should be zoned to the South West that already occupies the position of vice president,” the lawmaker said.
