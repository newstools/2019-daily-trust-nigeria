A Ugandan man, who was only six years old when his father lost his land in a legal dispute, has finally won it back 23 years later, after becoming a lawyer. Jordan Kinyera went through 18 years of education and legal training before taking on the case. On Monday, High Court ruled in his family’s favour. Mr Kinyera said the loss of the family land when he was aged six had changed his life. “I made the decision to become a lawyer later in life but much of it was inspired by events I grew up witnessing, the circumstances and frustrations my family went through during the trial and how it affected us.” Reminiscences with Aliyu Umar Misau When did adoption become a sin?
