The Member representing Ehime Mbano/Ihite Uboma/Obowo Federal Constituency of Imo State, John Chike Okafor (APC, Imo), has said accumulated experience in the private and public sectors makes him the best candidate for speaker of the incoming 9th House of Representatives. Okafor stated this in Abuja yesterday while receiving a delegation of the Arewa Good Governance and Transparency Initiative (AGGTI) which paid him a solidarity visit, urging him to run for speaker. The lawmaker, who used the opportunity to formally join the race, however, asked the ruling APC to consider ceding the position to the South East in the interest of equity, justice and national inclusion. “I hereby formally declare my interest to contest for the Speaker of the 9th House. I enjoy the support of my colleagues, and as you can see, my supporters cut across the entire federation. “For equity, justice, fairness and national inclusion, it’s important that the APC should zone the position of speaker to the South East. It’s unthinkable that the party should abandon their supporters in the region,” he said.
