President Muhammadu Buhari has assured Nigerians that he will put in all efforts to ensure the best for the country and her citizens when he begins a second term in office on May 29, 2019, while appreciating all those that voted him during the elections. Receiving the Board of Trustees and Advisory Council of Gidauniyar Jihar Katsina (Katsina State Development Fund) led by Justice Mamman Nasir at the State House, President Buhari said his campaign to all states of the federation was an eye opener. “Thank you for supporting me. I assure you that I will do my best during the second term. We will work for Nigeria and her people,’’ he said. The President said the crowd that welcomed his campaign train in each state was more than anyone can possibly “induce’’, attributing the turn outs to people’s appreciation of the efforts of his administration.

In his remarks, the Galadima of Katsina, Justice Nasir, said the foundation returns gratitude to God and all Nigerians for giving President Buhari the opportunity to serve another term in office. “We are most grateful to almighty Allah for bringing you back for another term in office. Our happiness and gratitude goes to Nigerians for electing you,’’ he said.
