The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has taken delivery of two Agusta 109 Power attack helicopters. Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, disclosed this yesterday in Maiduguri during a luncheon with troops of the Air Task Force (ATF) Operation LAFIYA DOLE (OPLD) to mark the Easter Celebrations. A statement from Air Force spokesman Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola said the helicopters are currently being assembled for induction during the forthcoming 2019 NAF Day Celebration taking place in Abuja from 27 – 29 April 2019. Daramola said ‪the luncheon, which is in keeping with the CAS’ tradition of celebrating festive periods with frontline troops, afforded him the opportunity to interact with the troops in an informal setting to appreciate them for their sacrifices in the fight against insurgency. He said the CAS expressed delight to be in Maiduguri and commended the resilience and commitment of the troops in ensuring that Nigeria and Nigerians are safe. He said the NAF, with the support of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, President Muhammadu Buhari, as well as the National Assembly, would continue to acquire new platforms and build human capacity whilst ensuring the welfare of personnel, in order to effectively respond to national security imperatives. Air Marshal Abubakar seized the opportunity to thank the government and people of Borno State as well as the Shehu of Borno and other traditional rulers in the State for their continued support to the NAF through the ATF OPLD.  5 killed in Airforce chopper crash in Borno Insurgency:  Five Air Force personnel died in Borno helicopter crash Nigerian Air Force, allied forces repel terrorists’ attacks in Baga
