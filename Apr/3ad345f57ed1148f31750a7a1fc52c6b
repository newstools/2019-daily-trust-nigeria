The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has charged its officers and men of the Western and Eastern Marine commands to intensify effort at curtailing smuggling through the waters. The Customs Area Controller (CAC) of the Western Marine Command (WMC), Boyilila Binga, gave the charge at the weekend during the passing out ceremony organised for the 40 officers trained to man the boats and vessels of the service in Lagos. Comptroller Binga who was represented at the event by the Deputy Comptroller in charge of Enforcement, Abubakar Adamu, told the officers that the only evidence to show for their training was to record increased seizure on waters. The training is in line with the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) convention to equip officers with requisite knowledge and techniques to operate on waters. The four-week mandatory training which ended on Thursday was to prepare the officers who are to man the serviceâ€™ boats and two ocean-going vessels. Both commands have officers that benefited from the four-week training put together by the management of the service and facilitated by Port Plus Nigeria Limited and Coastal Maritime Academy. Speaking at the end of the programme/presentation of certificates, Head of Operations, Port Plus Nigeria Limited, Comdr. Joseph Giwa (Rtd) stressed the need for personnel of the service to apply what they learnt while at sea.
