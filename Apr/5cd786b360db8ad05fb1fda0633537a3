The governorship candidate of Action Alliance (AA) in the just-concluded governorship election in Imo State, Ugwumba Uche Nwosu, has said he has an ace with which to regain his mandate at the Governorship and House of Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal. Nwosu had filed a case at the tribunal challenging the declaration of the candidate of the PDP, Emeka Ihedioha, by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Nwosu, who spoke with our correspondent, said he has two grounds upon which he is challenging Ihedioha’s election. He said Ihedioha did not meet the required constitutional spread of garnering 25 per cent of the votes cast in at least two-thirds of the 27 local government areas of the state. He said the second ground would be his trump card. “I have two grounds upon which I am challenging the declaration of Ihedioha as the governor-elect. The first is that he did not have the required spread to be returned as elected, while the second ground I am holding to my chest as my ace. I will unfold it at the tribunal,” said Nwosu.
