Bade Emirate in Yobe State has appealed to Senators Ali Ndume and Danjuma Goje to step down and support the endorsement of the Senate leader, Ahmad Lawan for the President of the ninth senate. Prominent title holders, Alhaji Mamman Suleiman and Alhaji Mohammed Gagiyo, who spoke on behalf of the Emirate on Saturday, said the endorsement of Senator Lawan was in the interest of the Northeast and Nigeria. Suleiman said that as fellow compatriots of the region, the two senators were expected to support Senator Lawan following his endorsement by the All Progressives Congress (APC). He said: “Nigeria, in the last four years, had suffered from unnecessary political conflicts between the executive and National Assembly which must not be repeated.” The Emirate urged all APC senators to remain united in the interest of the party and the country. On his part, Alhaji Mohammed Gagiyo said the experience of the senate leader in the National Assembly made him more prepared and qualified for the office of the senate president. “As a region, we should exhibit the spirit of unity we are known for and support one of our own, senator Ahmad Lawan. “The people of Bade Emirate are solidly behind Senate Leader, Ahmad Lawan for Senate President and we call on our brothers, Ndume and Goje to step down for Lawan,” he said.
