The Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Dr. Okechukwu Enelamah, has unveiled a hotel with a rooftop swimming pool in Abuja. Belanova Apartments and Suites, located in Maitama District of the FCT, is an enticing edifice in the heart of Abuja that not only projects the hospitality of the city, but also offers visitors and tourists fond memories. At the official opening of the hotel, the minister said the investment was a positive result of the present government’s emphasis on Domestic Direct Investment (DDI). Dr. Enelamah said the owner of the hotel, Louis Ezeigwe, built the business over time with consistency and commitment. He said, “This investment will bring value to Abuja, glory to Abuja, and those who will make use of the facilities will be delighted.” The Managing Director of Belanova Apartments and Suites, Ugochukwu Ezeigwe, explained that the hotel had 39 furnished apartments and that visitors to the facility would enjoy spacious apartments, a rooftop pool, a gym and two restaurants. Ezeigwe said the hotel would serve as a domestic substitute for foreign brands in the hospitality business.How revised housing fund bill, technology will drive affordable housing-Experts A retired broadcaster with the Nigeria Television Authority (NTA), Mrs. Eugenia Abu, who anchored the event, said the hotel was a home away from home.
