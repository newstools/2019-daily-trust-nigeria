Kwara State governor-elect Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq has said that issues concerning youth will be one of the greatest challenges his administration will tackle. Abdulrazaq said this at the weekend in Ilorin, the state capital, during a youth summit. The governor-elect, who was represented by his political associate, Kale Belgore, said his administration would pay optimum attention to the wellbeing of the youth. “Nigeria is a country blessed with huge population of youth. The United Nations estimates that Nigeria currently has a population of 199 million as at March 26, 2019. “This is neither good news nor bad one. A country’s youth population is often a double-edged sword. Higher youth population is an asset and a great element of power where the bulk of those young people are highly skilled, are engaged in very productive endeavors, and are duly mobilised for national development. But it could also be a burden or call it a time bomb where the young population is not so skilled, not properly engaged in anything meaningful…. “We will make sure that young people are at all times given ample opportunities to prove their mettle in a deliberate bid to make our youth agents of statecraft and catalysts for the socioeconomic development in Kwara and Nigeria as a whole,” he said. Earlier, the chairman of the local organizing committee (LOC) Kayode Oyin-Subir, said the objective of the summit was to set agenda for the incoming government in the state.
