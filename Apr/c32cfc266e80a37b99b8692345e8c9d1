The All Progressives Congress, APC has assembled four SANs to challenge the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP in court over its victory in the just concluded governorship election in Bauchi state, according to Governor Mohammed Abdullahi Abubakar. Governor Abubakar who returned to Bauchi on Wednesday evening, told his supporters at his Campaign Office that the APC as a party will go to court to reclaim its mandate from the PDP.  The video of the meeting which was seen by our reporter was confirmed by the Commissioner of Information, Ibrahim Sade. Recall that Governor Abubakar had conceded defeat after the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC announced Senator Bala Mohammed of the PDP as the winner of the election. The Governor who confirmed that he had earlier accepted his defeat as “destiny” informed his supporters that the leadership of the party would file a suit soon to challenge the election. “I went to Abuja as a loyal and obedient party member. I met with the National Chairman of the APC, I met with the Vice President of Nigeria, I also met with the President of Nigeria. “All these three offices said that the APC will file a suit in court to challenge the election results of Bauchi. “As an obedient member, I accept to go with that decision. Everyone knows when the results of the election were announced, I conceded defeat but I contested on the ticket of the party and the party has refused to accept the outcome,” he said. Reacting, the state PDP Chairman, Hamza Koshe Akuyam said that the decision of the APC to go to court is a welcome development. “we are ready to meet them in court. The  court will reaffirm our victory,” he said.  Ex minister Mohammed is new Bauchi gov-elect 2019: That toothless coalition in Bauchi Bala, Ningi’s subtle battle for Bauchi PDP guber ticket
