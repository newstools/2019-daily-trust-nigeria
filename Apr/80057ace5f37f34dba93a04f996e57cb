An unspecified number of persons travelling in five different vehicles were said to have been abducted by gunmen along the Birnin- Gwari-Kaduna Road at about 5.00pm on Saturday. The gunmen were said to have stopped the vehicles at different times between 4pm and 5pm near Ladi village and led all the passengers and drivers into the bush. A resident of Birnin Gwari, who identified himself as Salihu, said the five vehicles–two Golf cars, two Toyota Salon and a Sienna van–were parked on the road around Ladi village. “We are not certain how many people were in the cars but since they are mainly commercial vehicles, we assume they must contain no less than four people each,” he said. The Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Yakubu Sabo, when contacted, said the command was yet to receive such a report, but that he would find out if it was true.
