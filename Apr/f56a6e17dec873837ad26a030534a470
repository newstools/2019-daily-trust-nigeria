A one million man interfaith prayer rally in support of President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo ‎will hold in Abuja. Speaking at the inauguration of the planning committee for the prayer in Abuja, Archbishop Leonard Bature Kawas‎, chief convener of the event, said the prayer session would be for a successful swearing in and fruitful second term in office‎ of the president and the vice president. ‎He said the prayer session would feature prominent Islamic and Christian clerics who would not only pray for a successful tenure for the president but also for continuous peaceful coexistence in the country. “I feel we should support President Buhari because he means well for this country. The president is a Muslim, and I’m a Christian, but we are all Nigerians. “So, everybody must do their best to make sure that we have a good country. Before the elections, there were allegations and counter allegations. But we now have a president as announced by INEC. So, we should all support the president to ensure that he succeeds and our country succeeds.” 400 clerics, Katsina, Daura communities hold  prayers for Buhari, others Transition: Atiku represents Buhari at pre-hand over special prayers Plane crash: Osinbajo says my death would have caused trouble
