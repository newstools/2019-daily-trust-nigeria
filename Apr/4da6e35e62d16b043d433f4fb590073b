The PDP has alleged that the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami (SAN) and the Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi, were engaging in acts capable of causing constitutional crisis in Rivers State. The party alleged that Malami, Amaechi and other APC bigwigs were prevailing on the Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Tanko Mohammed, to reverse the judgement which stopped the APC from fielding candidates for the 2019 general elections. Addressing a press conference in Abuja, yesterday, PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said it was strange that leaders of the APC at the federal level were allegedly making such move at a time the elections were already concluded. “If this is allowed to occur, it will also amount to the highest travesty of justice, apart from being a direct abuse of court process. The Supreme Court is the highest temple of justice in our country and as such must protect itself from all forms of manipulative tendencies of the APC. “The PDP therefore urges the Acting CJN not to allow his office to be used by desperate power mongers in the APC to cause anarchy and perpetrate more violence in Rivers State,” Ologbondiyan said. PDP accuses Malami, Amaechi of plotting constitutional crisis in Rivers PDP, others take advantage of APC crisis in Rivers Amaechi and Wike’s war of supremacy in Rivers
