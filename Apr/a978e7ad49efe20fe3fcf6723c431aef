An Inspector of Police, Fanuroji Adeyemi, attached to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), Ikeja, Lagos, has told the court how the police, in May 2014, smashed a gang of armed robbers terrorising residents of the Ikotun area of Lagos. Testifying yesterday as a prosecution witness before Justice Adenike Josephine Coker sitting at the Ikeja High Court, Inspector Adeyemi said that the confession of a suspect led to the arrest of the gang’s leader in the suspected criminals’ hideout, which was an uncompleted building. The alleged leader of the gang, Ahmed Idris, who was described as a welder, and his accomplice, Wasiu Adedoyin, who is a battery charger, are standing trial for armed robbery. The witness said that the arrested suspect had told the police that he and his fellow gang members had been going from house to house robbing the residents, and also breaking into shops at Igando before luck ran out on them. Idris and Adeyemi, said to have no fixed address as they were sleeping about in uncompleted buildings and vehicles, were alleged to have burgled a shop at No. 77, Igando Road while armed with dangerous weapons and stole various food items and beverages. They were also alleged to have robbed Alhaji Noah Obabiyi of his phone, iPad and cash, altogether valued at N225,000. The police said Idris confessed that all the stolen items were usually sold to one Baba Egun. Justice Coker fixed further trial for May 14, 2019.
