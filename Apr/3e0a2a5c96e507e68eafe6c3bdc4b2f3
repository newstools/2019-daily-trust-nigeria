A Federal High Court in Abuja has suspended its judgment in the suit seeking to remove Senate President, Bukola Saraki and 53 other lawmakers over their defection. Justice Okon Abang yesterday suspended the judgment after counsel to the lawmakers, Mahmud Magaji (SAN) brought an application seeking to give a fair hearing to the lawmakers. In adjourning the matter indefinitely, Justice Abang expressed reservations that the lawmakers had sufficient time to defend the suit brought against them. “They allowed the plaintiff to incur a cost to prosecute this matter and also allowed the court to painstakingly prepare judgment. They are now in court trying to arrest the judgment,” he said. A civil society group, Legal Defence and Assistance Project (LEDAP) had brought the suit on September 14, 2018, for the interpretation of Section 68(1)(g) of the 1999 Constitution on defections. But Magaji informed the court that it was fundamental for the lawmakers to be heard before the court will make its final decision. But counsel to LEDAP, Ede Uko argued that the Supreme Court had held that a judgement of the court cannot be arrested. Consequently, Justice Abang ordered the lawmakers to file their processes and serve on LEDAP same day, while the CSO would reply within five hours. He fixed hearing of the application today (Friday) for the hearing of an application to allow the defence to be filed out of time.
