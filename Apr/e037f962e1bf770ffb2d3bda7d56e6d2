The European Council and the Parliament have announced that after Brexit, UK citizens coming to the Schengen area for a short stay of 90 days in any 180 days should be granted visa free travel. The agreement, which was already confirmed by EU ambassadors on behalf of the Council on Tuesday, was approved by the European Parliament Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs committee on Wednesday. The text now needs to be formally adopted by the European Parliament and the Council. According to EU rules, visa exemption is granted on condition of reciprocity. The British government has stated that it does not intend to require a visa from EU citizens travelling to the UK for short stays. The European Commission would monitor the respect of the principle of reciprocity on a continuous basis and immediately inform the European Parliament and the Council of any developments which could endanger the respect of this principle.
