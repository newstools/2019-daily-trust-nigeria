The Member representing Wase Federal Constituency, Hon. Idris Ahmed Maje, has said he is now angling to become the deputy speaker instead of speaker. Prior to his decision to battle for the position of deputy speaker, Maje, a lawmaker from Plateau North Central, was among the lawmakers jostling for the position of speaker. Maje explained that his respect for the decision of his party that zoned the speakership to the South West was the main reason he backed out from the race to be speaker. He made this known yesterday through his Special Aide, Ishaq Yahuza Jama’are, during the closing ceremony of the 26th Annual National Seminar of the Jama’atu Izalatil Bid’a Wa’ikamatis Sunnah (JIBWIS) in Jos. Maje added that because he was a loyal party member and for avoidance of division among party members, it was good for him to drop his ambition of becoming speaker of the 9th assembly.
