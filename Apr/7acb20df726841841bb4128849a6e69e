The Lagos State Commissioner for Home Affairs, Dr Abdulhakeem Abdullateef, has enjoined all Muslims not only to be active in politics but to also lead by exhibiting exemplary conduct as enjoined in the Holy Quran and taught by the Holy Prophet Muhammed. Dr Abdullateef, who is an Islamic scholar and academic, gave the charge on Sunday in his lecture, ‘Leadership by Example’, as the guest speaker at the 25th Open Air Lecture of the Ansar-ud-Deen Society of Nigeria, Akoka Branch (Division II), Lagos. The Commissioner enlightened that “leadership should not be seen as a position of superiority, but as a trial and burden to serve humanity with the fear of God and in total humility in the service of humanity.” According to him, while everyone was a leader, anyone who aspires to lead others must first be in total control of himself and use all what Allah has bestowed on him in ways directed by the Quran. Such a person, he said, “must be able to lead his mouth, knowledge, wisdom, wealth and other worldly possessions to secure the pleasure of God for himself and bring better lives to each and every one that he leads.” Dr Abdullateef enjoined Muslims to uphold and transmit good moral and values to the children, spouses and other members of the family at the home front, and to lead the society with good conscience and noble intentions. The Commissioner urged Muslims not to see positions as do-or-die affairs, “as only the Almighty God, the ultimate decider, omnipresence and omnipotence, puts man in positions.” Dr. Adegbite: His great legacies,  in his own words Hajj: Tour operators decry poor service delivery at Mina, Arafat Home of miracle baby turns Mecca
