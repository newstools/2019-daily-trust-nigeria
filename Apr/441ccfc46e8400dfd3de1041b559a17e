The South West chapter of the PDP has petitioned the Lagos State Commissioner of Police and the Directorate of State Security (DSS) disowning Segun Adewale who declared himself as the chairman of the party in the state recently. National Vice Chairman (South West) of the party, Dr. Eddy Olafeso, in the petition dated April 16, described Adewale as an “impostor” and reiterated that Dr. Adegbola Dominic remained the PDP chairman. Attached with the petition was the list of Ekiti governorship candidates in the 2018 election which showed Adewale as the candidate of ADP. “We wish to categorically state that the said impostor, Segun Adewale, is not a member of our party. It might interest you to know that this individual is the gubernatorial candidate of the Action Democratic Party (ADP) in the 2018 governorship election in Ekiti (see attached list), and we do not have any record of him decamping to our party, either in Lagos State or any other state chapter,” Olafeso said in the petition, a copy of which was sighted by our correspondent. The chapter urged the security agencies to restrain Adewale from having access to the state headquarters to maintain peace and order. But Adewale insisted in a chat with Daily Trust that he remained the PDP chairman in Lagos, saying his interest was in rebuilding the party. Asked to comment on the petition to the security agencies, he said, “Let the police come and arrest me.” On the claim by Dominic that he never won any election either in his ward or polling unit in Agbado-Oke Odo in Alimosho Local Government Area, Adewale described the claim as a blatant lie, saying if such was confirmed to be truth in the INEC results, he would donate N10m to the party and resign. “I have never been defeated in my polling unit. The result is there,” he reiterated.
