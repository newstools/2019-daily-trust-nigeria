The Head of Research, FSDH Research, Mr. Ayodele Akinwummi, has said that oil price may drop due to the slow pace in global trade, and therefore has urged the Federal Government to unlock and tap resources through Value Added Tax (VAT). Mr. Akinwummi who stated this during a press briefing titled: “Monetary Policy Easing; Fiscal Policy Choices”, said if the sale of crude oil which contributed largely to the Federal Government’s revenue decreased and the government expenditure increased, it would lead to fiscal deficit. “Weakness in the ability of the government to generate revenue from the sale of crude oil on the account of a little bit lower oil prices and production cost which affect Nigeria now. Those are the things that will drop oil price. So if this figures go down and government expenses are going to go up. It then means that fiscal deficit will increase and how will they cover for that by borrowing,” he said. He advised the Federal Government to deploy technology to drive financial inclusion through VAT to the informal sector, saying that borrowing to mitigate fiscal deficit would increase high interest rate.
