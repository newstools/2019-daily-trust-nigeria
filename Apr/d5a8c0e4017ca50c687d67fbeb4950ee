Recapitalization process of the Bank of Agriculture (BOA) is to be completed within the next 14 weeks, the Managing Director, Lead Capital Consortium, Dr Wale Adeoye, has said. This is as the managing director of the bank, Kabiru Adamu, said the bank has in the last two years under his watch recovered over N7 billion outstanding debt. They both spoke at the headquarters of the bank in Kaduna on Thursday during at a meeting of the BOA management with Lead Capital Consortium. Lead Capital Consortium is tasked with the responsibility of restructuring and recapitalization of the bank. The MD said BOA, established over 40 years ago, is facing challenges in staffing as the present workers have not been trained in modern agricultural finance system, debt recovery and infrastructural decay, hence the need to fund and restructure the bank. However, Lead Capital Consortium MD, said upon completion of the restructuring of BOA in 14 weeksâ€™ time, the Federal Government will recapitalize the bank with over N10 billion and that the process will continue through public funding targeting about N200 billion.
