The APC in Zamfara State has won all the 14 chairmanship and 147 councillorship positions in the local government council elections held last Saturday. Declaring the results in Gusau, the Chairman of the Zamfara State Independent Electoral Commission, Alhaji Garba Muhammad Danburam, said the APC won all the seats contested for in the elections. Danburam thanked all the stakeholders who helped in making the exercise successful. At least 42 political parties, including the ruling APC, participated in the exercise. The opposition PDP had earlier asked a court to stop the exercise, citing breach of electoral guidelines. The case is pending in court. The Chairmen of Maru, Shinkafi, Zurmi, Birnin Magaji, Kaura Namoda, Talata Mafara and Bakura local government areas were re-elected. The state APC Chairman, Alhaji Lawali M. Liman, expressed satisfaction over the exercise, adding that the party had done well in the state and that the people had shown their appreciation in return. The local government election in Zamfara held at a time the APC was battling  at the Supreme Court to reclaim all the seats it won during the national, state assembly, and governorship elections its members won but  later lost the mandates following an Appeal Court judgement.
