The Director General of National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Major General Suleiman Kazaure, has charged corps members posted to Benue state to initiate and execute projects that will add value to communities they will be posted to for their primary assignment. Kazuare, who gave the charge on Wednesday at the NYSC permanent orientation camp, Wannune in Tarka local government area of the state, further implored the corps members to consider their deployment for service to Nigeria as a privilege. He encouraged the young graduates to respect the cultures of the various communities where they will be deployed to, stressing that value addition to communities of their primary assignment will enable them leave indelible marks in the sands of history. “All my children are graduates. As graduates therefore, I expect you to respect the cultures of the various communities you will be posted to; avoid long movements; shun all forms of malpractices, use of drugs and drug abuse; avoid all forms of social vices. “As graduates, you have been found worthy not just in learning, but also in character. All I am saying is that conduct yourselves very well wherever you are posted to,” he said. The NYSC DG also warned that white colour jobs are difficult to get now and as such, the corps members must take the skills acquisition and entrepreneurship development programme of the scheme with all seriousness it deserves. Earlier in his address, the Benue State Coordinator of NYSC, Shicha Joshua Simon, said the mood in the camp was warm and stimulating as he commended NYSC supporting staff in the state and security agents for ensuring hitch-free camp activities so far. Shicha said the corps members had displayed very disciplined dispositions and are by all indices outstanding and promising set of corps members.
