Two persons, Hamza Muhammed, 35, and Abdullahi Alhaji Mani (now at large) were arraigned before Court 15, sitting at No-Manâ€™s-Land in Sabon Gari, Kano, over alleged criminal conspiracy, breach of trust and cheating contrary to sections 97, 312 and 322 of the Penal Code Law. The accused were said to have fraudulently collected 300 bags of fertilizer valued at N1,390,000 from one Abubakar Nuhu of Kura local government, Kano state, under the false pretext of selling and remitting the money within one week. The accused allegedly sold the goods and refused to pay the money back to the complainant as promised. According to the First Information Report (FIR), the arraignment was a result of a formal letter of complaint dated 11th February, 2019 written to the Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), Kano Metropolitan Area Command by the Chief Magistrate, Court 15. In the letter, the Chief Magistrate was asking the ACP to investigate a complaint by the said Abubakar Nuhu against one Ibrahim Muhammad Turaki of Gumi local government of Zamfara state. Police investigation however revealed that the said Ibrahim Muhammad Turaki did not make any transaction with the complainant either through collecting money or goods as alleged, but it was further revealed that the duo, Hamza Muhammed and Abdullahi Alh. Mani were the people who collected the said goods. However, the accused persons denied the content of the FIR while the prosecutor, Sergeant Jacob Yaduma, told the court that Police investigation was still ongoing and therefore applied for another date for further mention. The Judge, Chief Magistrate Mukhtar Garba Dandago, ordered that the accused persons be remanded in prison custody and adjourned the matter to 16th April, 2019 for further mentioning.
