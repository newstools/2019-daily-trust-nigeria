The Nigerian Military Court Martial sitting in Maiduguri yesterday dismissed Flt.-Lt. Martins Owerem, of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF), for raping a 14-year old displaced girl. President of the Court, Maj.-Gen. Yakubu Auta, held that the court found Owerem the guilty on the two counts rape and assault. The convict was charged with defilement; assault and disobedient to standing order. Auta held that the prosecution, through five witnesses and four exhibits, have proved their case beyond reasonable doubts. He held that the court found the officer guilty on the first and second-count charge, while it discharge and acquitted him on the third-count charge. The judge, therefore, ordered for dismissal from service of the convict on the first count charge and sentenced him to demotion by one rank on the second-count charge. Earlier, the Judge Advocate, Capt. Aminu Mairuwa, said the convict on Sept. 29, 2018, while on patrol at Kawon Jiya in the outskirts of Maiduguri, arrested some girls, who were collecting firewood, on the pretext that they crossed into the restricted area. Mairuwa argued that the convict took one of the girls into the bush and raped her. However, Defence Counsel, Mr Abbas Abba, sought for lenience in view of the selfless service and contributions of the convict in the counter insurgency campaign.
