The Institute of Agribusiness Management Nigeria (IAMN) has inducted a new set of its members even as it raised alarm over the sum of $22 billion being expended on food importation on annual basis. At the induction ceremony hosted in Lagos, the institute’s president, Prof. Andie Brisibe, who was represented by the Managing Director of Bic Farms Concepts, decried what he described as the unfortunate amount being expended on food importation while at the same time enriching other countries. “Nigeria is spending annually on the importation of food what ordinarily can be produced locally by agribusiness entrepreneurs in the country. How can we be spending over $22 billion to import food into Nigeria? Imagine if Nigerian agripreneurs are the ones producing this food. The money will spread and everyone will be the better for it. “By importing food commodities, we are enriching other countries and improving the livelihoods of their farmers at the expense of our own. So IAMN is championing this course in the area of  improving the technical know-how of our members in areas of capacity development, in areas of commercial crop and livestock production, agro processing and agribusiness trade,’’ Brisibe said. The IAMN president, however, called for collaboration among stakeholders in the various agribusiness value chains in developing the sector, saying agribusiness is capable of fully diversifying the nation’s economy and providing jobs for unemployed Nigerians. He lamented that one of the challenges facing the agricultural industry is that everybody just come into the industry claiming to be agricultural consultants without proper standardization and certification. He said many Nigerians are losing investment funds to quack agricultural consultants.
