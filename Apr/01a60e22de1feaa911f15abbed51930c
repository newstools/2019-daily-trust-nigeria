The Ondo State government has threatened petrol dealers in the state to open to customers as any filling station found to be hoarding the product would be sealed. In a statement signed by the Senior Special Adviser to Governor Rotimi Akeredolu on special duties and strategy, Dr Doyin Odebowale and made available to journalists on Saturday, the government frowned at the scarcity of fuel which has crippled both commercial and private activities. The government said it viewd with grave concern, the latest attempt by some unscrupulous persons to create panic through the hoarding of fuel despite the assurances from the NNPC on the availability of the product. “Nigerians have been assured of regular supply of the product and this Government has no reason to disbelieve the organisation. “It is against this backdrop that the Government warns, sternly, all petrol dealers in the State, to desist from any unpatriotic acts which may inflict pains on the people. “We, on our part, will resist and sanction any untoward practice, conceived and/or executed, to engender hardship in the Ondo State. “Consequently, the Government directs all filling stations operating in the State to open same forthwith. “Any dealer caught hoarding fuel will be arrested and prosecuted. The business premises affected shall be sealed”, the statement said. “Any attendant caught selling petrol above the regulated pump price, under any guise, will be arrested and prosecuted,” it added. The state government therefore, called on law enforcement agents to arrest any person found hawking fuel in containers of any shape.
