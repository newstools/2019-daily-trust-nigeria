The African Democratic Congress (ADC) has said that President Muhammadu Buhari, the INEC, and various security agencies are colluding to circumvent the people’s will as demonstrated by their massive votes for the joint presidential candidate of the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. The party, in a communique issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Mrs Yemi Kolapo, at the end of its National Working Committee (NWC) meeting in Abuja, yesterday, said, like most Nigerians, ADC members believed that the people voted Atiku for President. It said, “ADC shall continue to give unalloyed support to Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the PDP and the joint presidential candidate of CUPP in his quest to reclaim his mandate. “Like most Nigerians, members of ADC believe that the people voted for him (Atiku) to be President. President Buhari, INEC and the various security agencies are merely colluding to circumvent the will of the people. This cannot stand.” The party, however, said that its strategic goals were not met because “Nigeria’s democracy is tragically challenged.” The ADC alleged that there was collusion between the APC Federal Government and INEC to cheat and deliver results scripted from the Presidency. The communique, signed by the National Chairman of ADC, Chief Ralphs Nwosu; and National Secretary, Alhaji Said Abdullahi, reads in part: “As a political party, we abhor fraudulent electoral practices. That is why we were the only party that set up an organisation to address such vices – Coalition for Electoral Integrity (C4e-Integrity).” 45 parties adopt Atiku as presidential candidate ‘1.6m votes’ claim: PDP, Atiku now suffering from post-election depression How Atiku emerged as Buhari’s main challenger
