Two children have been killed and 20 other people injured after a bouncy castle was blown high into the sky in central China’s Henan province. A small whirlwind known as a dust devil tore the inflatable from the ground at a fairground in Yucheng county. One parent reportedly told local media that she saw children fall from a height of about 20 metres. A county government official told the South China Morning Post it was unclear whether “human factors” played a role. Local authorities said 18 other children and two adults were taken to hospital. One child was in a serious condition while the rest were being treated for minor injuries.
