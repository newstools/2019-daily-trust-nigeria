Grand Cereals, a multipurpose limited liability company and subsidiary of UAC, has organised its annual customer and trade partners’ dinner and awards ceremony in Abuja and Asaba where it appreciated and celebrated its zonal partners and customers. At both events, the Ag Managing Director, Mr Sanjeen Jain and the company General Manager (Sales) Sadhu Panda, explained the company’s success stories despite the huge challenges it was confronted with in the last two years. They urged the Federal Government to encourage local investors to maintain its partnership in providing employment opportunities for graduates and none-graduates in the country. They noted that the contributions of their customers, over the years, had increasingly paved uninhibited ways to the growth of the company, despite the huge and almost insurmountable challenges it faced, especially with the business environment in those years. Apart from appreciating the customers including those who have immensely contributed to the success stories, the company bosses disclosed that they would continue to partner with state and federal governments with a view to strengthening business development of the company. “We are proud of the achievements of many of us in 2017 and appreciate the efforts we made to get through 2018 but we are very hopeful you will surpass our expectations in 2019. ‘‘Despite the difficult circumstances, in appreciation of your support and loyalty, we decided to organize this event to celebrate and reward great achievers for 2017 and 2018,” said Mr Sanjeen who disclosed that the quality of offerings have improved and were more consistent based on the feedbacks they have been getting for the past one year. “Grand Cereals is today giving back to its customers because they ensured we are in business; without them we will not be in business, the economic growth may be shaking, but we are doing well with our esteemed customers and their values.” ‘‘I want to assure you that we will continue to intensify our marketing support and trade margin improvement initiatives to ensure you are doing business with us profitably, he added.
