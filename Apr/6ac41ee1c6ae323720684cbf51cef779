The Majority Leader of  Ogun State House of Assembly, Adeyinka Mafe, has returned to the All Progressives Congress (APC) barely a month after losing his House of Representatives election under the platform of the Allied Peoples’ Movement (APM). Daily Trust recalls that Mafe who represents Sagamu I Constituency in November 2018, had resigned his membership of APC and joined APM, citing injustice by the leadership of APC during the party’s primaries as part of reasons for the defection. However, on Tuesday, the Speaker, Suraj Adekunbi read Mafe’s withdrawal letter on the floor of the house, stating his decision to return to the APC. “I had earlier written a letter of which to leave APC. “I write to officially withdraw the letter and wish to notify that I remain a member of APC next level,” the statement reads. Our correspondent reports that since Mafe’s defection to APM, the assembly’s leadership has not elected a new leader.
