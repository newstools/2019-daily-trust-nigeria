The senator representing the FCT, Senator Philip Tanimu Aduda, has said he will continue to create employment for youths and women in the territory. Aduda stated this when he received the Tiv community in Kuje Area council in his office at the National Assembly complex, Abuja on Tuesday, who came to congratulate him over his victory in the just concluded general elections. He also pledged to provide potable drinking water, rehabilitate rural roads as well as assist rural farmers with inputs across villages in the territory. He canvassed for the establishment of an industrial estate in his constituency which, he said, will provide jobs for the youth and boost the economy in the FCT. He stressed the need for people of the FCT to be obedient to constituted authorities, noting that it is God that establishes government, hence, people should always obey and support it. Aduda pointed out that anybody who is rebellious to government was not doing the will of God. “Now that elections are over people should note that God has chosen President Muhammadu Buhari to rule Nigeria for a second term,” he said. The senator said his strategy would be based on issues that have to do with peoples welfare and transformation of his constituency. Earlier, the Ter Tiv of Kuje Area Council, Chief Geoffrey Adzenda Begha, while congratulating Aduda for his victory in the last National Assembly election, described him as a vital instrument for the FCT,. He prayed God to sustain in him positive leadership values and spirit of patriotism.
