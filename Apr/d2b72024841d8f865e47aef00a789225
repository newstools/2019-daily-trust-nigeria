An educational therapist and founder of Royal School of Educational Therapy Foundation, based in the FCT, Abuja, Dr. Badewa Adejugbe-Williams, has called on parents and guardians not to see Down Syndrome as a disease, stressing that people living with it are like everyone else. Dr. Adejugbe-Williams stressed that children with Down Syndrome were capable of independent function and participation in society, just as she advocated for acceptance and inclusion of those with Down Syndrome, learning disorders and other disabilities, including autism, cerebral palsy, among others. She made the call while speaking to a section of the media on the International Day of Down Syndrome, regretting that awareness was very low in Nigeria. The educational therapist  assured that Royal School of Educational Therapy Foundation was poised to raise awareness about the most common genetic condition known as Down Syndrome, just as she called for support from all stakeholders. She said, “The Royal School of Educational Therapy Foundation in Abuja commemorated the World Down Syndrome Day with fun-filled activities in which our students and staff participated. “To start the event, students engaged in a brief question and answer session and recitations on Down Syndrome. After the informative session, they continued with thrilling games, swimming, dancing, ate tasty snacks and had photo shoots with posters and placards wearing colourful socks, and many more fun activities. “The commemoration ended with the screening of a movie: “Where Hope Grows”, about a man living with Down Syndrome. The idea is to give our students a sense of inclusiveness in the society. All that is needed is support from all stakeholders.”  Schools seek more funding for treating autism My child is diagnosed with Down syndrome Hope rising for those living with down syndrome condition
