The chairman of Sanga Local Government Area of Kaduna State, Charles Danladi, yesterday alleged plans  to disrupt the peace in the area. He called on the security agencies to investigate and bring those trying to cause mayhem in the area to book. Danladi, at a press conference in Kaduna, said he got a security report that a campaign based on false claims alleging there was a plan to move against Sanga indigenes who are Christians and were holding public office was about to  be unleashed to cause crisis in the local government area. He alleged that those behind it met in Kaduna over the weekend under the auspices of a political party and had by the evening of Sunday sent money to some persons in Sanga to fund protests scheduled for today. He said: “They want to cloak their negative activities under the guise of protecting me against alleged attempts to remove me as chairman of Sanga Local Government Council by Dr. Hadiza Balarabe, the deputy governor-elect of Kaduna State. There is nothing of the sort and the masterminds know this but they seek to deliberately perpetrate falsehood and further irresponsible narratives.” Kaduna LG boss raises alarm over plans to disrupt peace Council Chairman raises alarm over plans to instigate religious crises in Kaduna What we’re doing to ensure lasting peace in southern  Kaduna - Sanga LG boss
