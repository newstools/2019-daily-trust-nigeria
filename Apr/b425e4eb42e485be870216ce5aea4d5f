Presenting the motion, Aku told the House that on the fateful day, some gunmen suspected to be herdsmen stormed Bagana and the neighbouring villages of Patanyi and Ogba and unleashed mayhem. He said that the gunmen numbering over 300, ransacked and set houses ablaze, killing over 22 persons including two mobile police men in gruesome manner. “This recent attack is one too many since 2013 when the crisis erupted. “In 2015, similar violent attack by the Fulani herdsmen left the town in rubbles as scores of people were killed; property worth millions of Naira were burnt and destroyed. “However, while the people were struggling to overcome their losses and look forward to a brighter future, they were again attacked on Sunday, April 7, he said.
