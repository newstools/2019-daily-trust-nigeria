The North Central APC Ambassadors has told National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, that the geo-political zone deserves the position of Speaker of the House of Representatives having secured 2.4 million votes for President Muhammadu Buhari in the last election. In a letter addressed to Oshiomhole by the APC youths who staged a protest at the national secretariat of the party in Abuja, yesterday, they requested that the position of Speaker be zoned to the North Central zone of the country as the political intrigue over the composition of leadership in 9th assembly intensified. The letter, a copy of which was made available to journalists, was signed by five state coordinators and FCT coordinator, including Muyideen Yusuf (Kwara), Rita Longjap (Plateau), Muhammad Ibn Muhammad (Niger), Lucas Cassius (Nasarawa), Yahaya Dauda (FCT) and Shehu Araga (Kogi). The North Central group, in the letter, argued that since the North West has the President, South West the Vice President and the Senate President has been zoned to the North East, the speakership must be zoned to the North Central. The letter partly read, “North Central has consistently been loyal to the party. Since 1999, NC has never occupied the position of speaker or deputy speaker while all the other zones have occupied these positions.” Why Bago deserves to be Reps speaker — Dr. Dooba Ex-deputy speaker writes APC leadership over Dogara Speakership: APC stalwart makes case for North Central
