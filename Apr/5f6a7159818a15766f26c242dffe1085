The Human Rights Sight has said that the Kano State Commissioner of Police, Mohammed Wakili, was biased in the arrest of the state Deputy Governor, Nasiru Gawuna, during the March gubernatorial election in the state. A statement from the group signed by  Ramat A. Ibrahim copied Amnesty International and the United Nations, said  the arrest of the deputy governor was contrary to the provisions of the constitution. “The Commissioner of Police, Mr. Wakili, was obviously insinuated in taking sides with Sen. Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso otherwise Kwankwaso should have been arrested and brought to book over the instigation of violence through radio programmes at Vision FM and Arewa Radio”, the statement said. It added: “If the CP can violate the constitution by arresting a serving deputy governor despite the immunity of his office while others without immunity are inciting youths to violence, this is definite evidence of bias”.
