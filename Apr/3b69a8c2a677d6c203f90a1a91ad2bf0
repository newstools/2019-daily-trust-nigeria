A member-elect of the House of Representatives from Bauchi state, Mansur Manu Soro, has disclosed that the choice of Femi Gbajabiamila as the candidate for the House’s Speaker by the All Progressives Congress (APC) should not be seen as an imposition. The member representing Darazo/Ganjuwa federal constituency said the choice was the right move by the party to have a good leadership and avoid competition among its members. According to him, the choice of Gbajabiamila will also consolidate and engender more cohesion among its members and reduce friction. He added that the South West zone deserved to produce the Speaker for supporting President Buhari in 2015 and that, Gbajabiamila who earlier eyed the Speaker’s seat in 2015 is the right candidate for the job now because of his experience and support among his colleagues.
