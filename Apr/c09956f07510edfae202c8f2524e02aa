Anti-graft candidate Zuzana Caputova has won Slovakia’s presidential election, making her the country’s first female head of state. Ms Caputova, who has almost no political experience, defeated high-profile diplomat Maros Sefcovic, nominated by the governing party, in a second round run-off vote on Saturday. She framed the election as a struggle between good and evil. Ms Caputova cited last year’s murder of an investigative journalist Jan Kuciak as one of the reasons she decided to run for president, which is a largely ceremonial role. She won 58% of the vote, with Mr Sefcovic trailing on 42%. Slovakia: Anti-corruption candidate leads poll Comedian elected as Guatemala president Women win in Costa Rica, lose in Anambra
