The Federal Government has concluded plans to assist farmers affected by flood between July and October 2018 in seven local government areas of Anambra State. The National Emergency Management Agency’s supervisor of the project in the state, Mrs Bolanle Ojo, disclosed this yesterday at the ongoing revalidation exercise of affected farmers at Ogbaru near Onitsha. He said the beneficiaries were from Anambra East, Anambra West, Ayamelum, Ogbaru, Orumba North, Awka North and Ihiala Local Government Areas. According to her, grants to support farmers will come in form of seedlings, fertilizers and agro-chemicals for them to have good yield in the 2019 farming season. “The farmers will be supported based on their farm size and seedlings like rice, yam, maize, cassava, plantain and vegetables as it apply to them. “This is in line with the directive of the National Food Security Council led by President Mohammadu Buhari to further ameliorate their plights,” Ojo said.
