A former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives and member of the Board of Trustees of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Babangida Nguroje, has urged all members-elect to elect Femi Gbajabiamila as the next Speaker for his experience and being one of the strongest characters in the National Assembly. Nguroje, who chairs the board of Nigeria Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC), spoke yesterday in Abuja at the formal declaration of Gbajabiamila to run for the Office of the Speaker at the inauguration of the 9th Assembly. “I worked with Femi when I held sway as deputy speaker, we were both in the leadership and I can attest to his experience, detail attention to parliamentary business and commitment with which he approached his duties and I believe that he is the proper person for the job. “I therefore urge members-elect to look at the greater interest which is Nigerian and elect a competent and committed lawmaker in the person of Femi as their speaker,” Nguroje said. According to him, that time has come for the parliament to elect their best for the good of the institution and the nation. He said, “Every member of the House is competent, but there must be only one speaker at a time, so I urge the members to key behind this fine lawmaker whose experience and exposure are not in doubt.” ‘Over 230 Reps-elect behind Gbajabiamila/Monguno ticket’ PDP plots to pick Ogor as Dogara’s deputy thickens Intrigue as Jibrin, Dogara, Gbajabiamila, others join race for speaker
