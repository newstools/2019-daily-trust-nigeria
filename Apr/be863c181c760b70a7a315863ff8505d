A pet deer has gored a man to death and seriously injured his wife in a rare attack in Australia, police say. The man, 47, had gone to feed the stag on his property in Victoria when the attack happened on Wednesday. The woman suffered life-threatening injuries after going to her husbandâ€™s aid, local media said. She was flown to hospital for treatment. A recent study into all deaths caused by animals in Australia between 2000 and 2013 found none had involved deer.
