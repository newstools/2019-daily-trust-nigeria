Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates said on Sunday they had agreed to send Sudan $3 billion worth of aid, throwing a lifeline to the country’s new military leaders after protests led to the ousting of president Omar al-Bashir. The two Gulf Arab countries will deposit $500 million with the Sudanese central bank and send the rest in the form of food, medicine and petroleum products, their state news agencies said in parallel statements. But in a potential setback to efforts to form a new government, a coalition of protesters and opposition groups said it was suspending contacts with the political committee of the military rulers’ Transitional Military Council, accusing it of being composed of “remnants” of the ousted regime.
