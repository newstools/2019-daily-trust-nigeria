A total of 25 women, comprising of widows, divorcees and housewives, have been graduated at Ummu Attiya Women Centre, Unguwar Dawaki in Suleja, Niger State. Speaking at the occasion, the proprietor of the centre, Malama Amina Abdullahi, said the centre, which was established in 2006, with a few women, now has over 150 students in various classes. She said the centre was a non-governmental organization (NGO) which offers free basic education during weekends. She said the aims and objectives of the centre were to serve humanity and to give the less privileged women who were denied the opportunity to acquire western education to do so. She said the centre teaches English, mathematics, social studies, and health education, saying the first graduation was held in 2014 with 16 students. In her address, the wife of Niger State governor, Dr. Amina Abubakar Bello, stressed the need for housewives to devote their time acquiring western education in whatever situation they found themselves. She commended the management of Ummu Attiya Women Centre for devoting time to the education of widows and divorcees, and pledged to support the centre with learning and instructional materials. Highlights of the event were the presentation of certificates to the graduands and a gift to Dr. Amina by the management of the centre.
