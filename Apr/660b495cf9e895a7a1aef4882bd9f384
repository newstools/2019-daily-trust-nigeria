Two former Coptic Christian monks have been sentenced to death in Egypt over the murder of a bishop last year, officials have confirmed. Bishop Epiphanius, 64, was found dead in a pool of blood in July 2018 at a desert monastery north-west of Cairo. Authorities blamed the killing on unspecified “differences” between the monks and the bishop. The punishment was handed down in February, before being passed down to Egypt’s grand mufti for review. The Damanhur Criminal Court confirmed the men’s death sentences. One of the monks, Wael Saad, said he had used an iron pole to bludgeon the bishop to death. Another, named Remon Rasmi, was accused of helping him. Saad and Rasmi, who are also known by their monastic names of Ashiah and Faltaous, can appeal against their sentencing.
