An FCT High Court in Jabi has ordered the arrest of former Petroleum Minister, Dan Etete and former Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Mohammed Adoke. The duo, along with four foreigners, Raph Wetzels, Casula Roberto, Pujato Stefano, and Burrato Sebastiano, were declared wanted following an application by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). They were meant to be arraigned before the court yesterday to answer to a fraud charge in the Malabu Oil scandal. However, following their absence in court, EFCC’s counsel, Aliyu Yusuf, brought a motion ex parte praying the court for a warrant of their arrest, and an order for leave to execute the warrant outside Nigeria. He noted that the EFCC since 2017 had pressed charges against them as well as Shell Nigeria Exploration Production Co. Ltd, Nigeria Agip Exploration Limited, Eni Spa, Aliyu Abubakar, and Malabu Oil & Gas Limited, but they have all refused to appear in court. Ruling on the motion, Justice D. Z. Senchi granted the prayers and ruled that the Nigeria police, the INTERPOL and any other law enforcement agency should arrest them anywhere they were found including outside jurisdiction of the court. The matter was thereafter adjourned to July 11 for further hearing.
