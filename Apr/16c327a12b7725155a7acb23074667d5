Jaiz Charity and Development Foundation has spent N10 million to provide a lifeline to 167 poor people across the 14 local government areas of Zamfara State. Speaking during the distribution of poverty alleviation materials to selected vulnerable people, the Head of Programmes, Engr. Ahmed Muhammad Yola, who represented the Director/CEO of the Foundation, Imam Abdullahi Shu’aibu, said the gesture was to support poor families in different communities of the state. In the intervention programme, 34 people received cash, 31 grinding machines, 28 sewing machines and 31 people received assorted grains. “It is an intervention programme that is carried out annually across the state of the federation and the people are selected based on the assessment carried out earlier, we are not the ones doing the selection process, we only come and supervise what has taken place,” he said. In his remarks, the Managing Director/CEO of Jaiz, Engr Garba A. Muhammad, said similar intervention programmes had taken place in the state in 2014 and 2015 and that it cut across healthcare delivery and loan repayment for those imprisoned.
