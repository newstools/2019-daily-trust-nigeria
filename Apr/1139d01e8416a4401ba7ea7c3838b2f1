Elders from Kwara South Senatorial District, yesterday, called for the zoning of the position of Speaker of the House of Assembly to Kwara North in the interest of fairness and justice. The elders made the call in a statement issued in Ilorin by the Chairman of Elders of Kwara South Senatorial District, Chief James Bamisaiye Ayeni, on behalf of the influential group. “The people of Kwara South Senatorial Zone hereby echo their support for the emergence of the Speaker of the House of Assembly from Kwara North Senatorial Zone. We are totally committed to this position,” the statement read in part. He said it was only fair to concede the speakership slot to the North since the remaining two districts: Central and South, had each got the elective position of governor and deputy governor respectively. He said while there was nothing bad in anyone nursing an ambition, such desire, he added, must engender peace and unity among the people. “While people reserve the right to pursue their ambitions, Kwara South Senatorial Elders believe that ambition must be tamed and must not be wild to the point of threatening our unity; which is capable of truncating our focus on good governance and commitment to providing dividends of democracy to the good people of Kwara who have been so marginalised for so long. We can better achieve this in the atmosphere of fairness, equity and justice,” the statement further read.  2019: Kwara North APC elders forum calls for power shift APC Kicks as traditional rulers bless PDP Kwara guber pact Kwara 2015 and southern agitation
