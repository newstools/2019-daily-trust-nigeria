Top Nigerian leaders, namely the president, vice president and the Senate President, are currently out of the country, leaving only Speaker, Yakubu Dogara, within. There was no evidence that in the absence of the trio, power was transmitted to Dogara, who is the Number 4 Citizen. President Muhammadu Buhari had on Friday jetted out to Jordan for the World Economic Forum (WEF), from where he proceeded to Dubai for another official engagement. On his part, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has travelled to Rwanda, while Senate President Bukola Saraki is currently in Qatar for the International Parliamentary Union (IPU) meeting. However, it was learnt that there was no letter to the National Assembly by the president transmitting power to anybody. A source at the National Assembly said the president did not need to transmit power since he was not embarking on a medical vacation or his annual leave. Besides, the source said the president was going to be out of the country on official engagement for only a few days, hence there was no need for transmitting power to the vice president or anybody else. The source added that the president could give directive from where he is currently since it is an official assignment.
