The World Bank says it will support Edo State government to ensure that small and medium scale businesses benefit from the private sector development in the state. The bank’s delegation, led by Ms. Edda Ivan-Smith, stated this at the weekend in Benin during a facility tour at the Edo State Geographic Information Service (EdoGIS) agency office and the site of the Benin Industrial and Enterprise Park. Ms. Ivan-Smith said the team was in Edo to collect relevant geographic information data of the state, and commended Governor Godwin Obaseki on the deployment of geospatial technology for land management and geo-mapping of the state. “We are impressed by EDoGIS and think it is very well organised and managed. The World Bank is very keen to support the state government to ensure local communities, small and medium businesses, including farmers are able to benefit from private sector development in terms of shared benefits, and perhaps in preferential treatment in terms of employment opportunities,” she said. She added that the bank was already working with Edo State on an economic transformation project that will soon come on stream. 50,000 to benefit from financial inclusion in Edo World Bank approves N14bn dev fund for Edo State World Bank group approves project series to boost power in Nigeria
