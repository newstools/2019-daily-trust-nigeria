The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has said its fighter platforms destroyed armed bandits logistic base in Kagara Forest in Zamfara State. Air Force spokesman, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola,  said sustained air operations against armed bandits’ hideouts in Zamfara State and its environs by the Air Task Force (ATF) for Operation Diran Mikiya destroyed some logistics stores belonging to the bandits at a location within Kagara Forest. He said, “The operation was executed on April 13, following credible intelligence reports indicating that some of the armed bandits who had fled their camps as a result of NAF’s earlier air strikes had relocated some logistics items, including fuel, motorcycles and local arms making equipment, to another location within Kagara Forest.” He said, “Accordingly, the ATF dispatched a Mi-35 helicopter gunship, supported by an Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platform, to attack the target.” He said, “The target area initially appeared uninhabited. However, as the helicopter approached, some of the bandits were seen emerging from under the shrubbery and running away from the area.” Air Force destroys bandits logistics store in Zamfara Air force destroys 8 bandits’ camps in Zamfara Air force warplanes destroy Bandit camps, kill scores in Zamfara
