Some security experts will converged on Lagos next week to brainstorm on the way forward on the nation’s security system as killings and destruction of property persistent across the country. Organised by Securex West Africa, this year’s show is expected to attract more than 2,500 visitors, 85 exhibiting brands along with key industry stakeholders from governmental organisations and prominent industry associations. As Nigeria’s population continues to grow with an estimated population of 450 million by 2050, it is important that all stakeholders including security, military, political, civil society and more, come together to discuss solutions that will curb current and future threats while ensuring stability in the country. The exhibitions Regional Director, George Pearson said: “Every year, we consult with leading members of the industry to put together a cohesive programme of conference sessions that will not only inform Securex visitors, but also educate. “In the current industry climate, with this transition into a new digital era, companies across the board are facing brand new threats and it is our goal to provide valuable insights into how to protect themselves.” Scheduled for 16 and 17 of April 2019, it is with the theme ‘National Security in a Boundaryless World: 21st Century Solutions to Nigeria’s Insecurity’. Key industry experts set to take the stage this year are; Honorable Aliyu Gebi, Senior Special Advisor to the Minister of Interior; Mr Wale Olaoye, CEO Halogen Security; Dr Solomon Arase, Former Inspector General of Police and Capt. Aliyu Umar (Rtd), CEO Goldwater and Riversands Consults and other top security personnel in the country.
