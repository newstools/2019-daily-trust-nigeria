The Ogun State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal on Monday ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission to grant the candidate of the Allied Peoples Movement (APM), Adekunle Akinlade and his party, access to the documents used for conduct of March 9 election in the state. Justice Chinwe Onyeabor-led three man panel gave the order at its inaugural sitting following a motion ex parte filed by the Akinlade and the party. The petitioners are challenging the victory of Dapo Abiodun and his party, APC, which were joined in the application as second and third respondents. The petitioners’ counsel, Mamman Osuman SAN, who appeared with Ahmed Raji SAN, told the tribunal that the order became necessary to allow the applicants access the electoral documents “with a view to maintaining the petition already filed before the tribunal.” The application, according to him, was brought pursuant to section 151 sub-section 1 and 2 of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended). In granting the orders, Justice Onyeabor said the prayers were granted “strictly in compliance to section 151 sub-section 1 and 2 of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended). The tribunal, however, adjourned the matter to April 9 for confirmation of service.
