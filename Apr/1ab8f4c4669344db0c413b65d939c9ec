An 18-year-old woman suspected of making threats to Denver-area schools has been found dead, the FBI says. Sol Pais was reportedly obsessed with the 1999 Columbine high school massacre, in which two teenagers murdered 12 students and a teacher. The alleged threat led to school closures for half a million students and a manhunt for the Florida woman. She allegedly travelled to the state and bought a shotgun ahead of the 20th anniversary of the Columbine shooting. Jefferson County Sheriff Jeff Shrader said on Wednesday that she died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, the Associated Press reported. The FBI earlier tweeted there was no longer a threat to the community and the suspect is deceased.
