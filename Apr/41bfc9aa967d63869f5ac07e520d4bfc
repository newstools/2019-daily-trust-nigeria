MacKenzie Bezos, the former wife of Amazon boss, Jeff Bezos, is getting a divorce settlement of $35billion (N12.6 trillion), making her the world’s third wealthiest woman. MacKenzie will retain 25 percent of the couple’s stake in Amazon. According to a filing by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission posted on Thursday, although she has granted Jeff voting control of her shares, MacKenzie will still own about 4 percent of the company. On a Twitter post on Thursday, she wrote, “Happy to be giving him all of my interests in the Washington Post and Blue Origin and 75% of our Amazon stock plus voting control of my shares to support his continued contributions with the teams of these incredible companies.” Big as the settlement is, Bezos is still the world’s richest man.
