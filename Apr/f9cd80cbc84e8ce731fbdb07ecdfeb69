The gubernatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the March 9 governorship election in Oyo State, Mr Adebayo Adelabu, has filed a suit before the Election Petitions Tribunal challenging the victory of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Mr Seyi Makinde. Adelabu prayed that the tribunal should overturn the victory of the PDP candidate Mr Makinde. He filed the suit alongside his party, whose state chairman, Chief Akin Oke, hinted recently that the party was considering challenging the outcome of the election in the state. “I want to repeat what I said concerning the outcome of the last governorship election. First, I want to greet all the people who genuinely voted for us. But where there is a genuine case of fraud, of course, why not go to court? “Do you want us to continue to support fraud? I repeat we will go to court once there are enough grounds to do so,” Oke added. On Tuesday, the APC made real its threat as it was listed as the second petitioner. The petition has the Independent National Electoral Commission as first respondent while Makinde and PDP are second and third respondents respectively. In a swift reaction, the PDP secretary, Mr Wasiu Adeleke, told reporters that there was no cause for alarm because it was glaring from the results across all the five geo-political zones of the state that “Engr. Seyi Makinde won overwhelmingly and polled the highest number of votes and was subsequently declared as winner.” Governorship: Results of 14 states set for tribunal What we want from Oyo governor-elect — Oke-Ogun residents Gov’ship polls: Parties set for legal battle in 15 states
