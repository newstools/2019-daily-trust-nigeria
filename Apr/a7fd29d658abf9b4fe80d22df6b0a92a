The severance package of senators and members of House of Representatives, who are not returning to the 9th Assembly, as well as those of their aides, would cost the sum of N24.6 billion of tax payer’s money. This is contained in the 2019 Appropriation Bill passed on Tuesday by the two chambers of the National Assembly. Chairman of the House Committee on Appropriation, Mustapha Dawaki (APC, Kano), told newsmen that the severance package was why the‎ earlier projected deficit of 1.096 was increased by the lawmakers. “In terms of the 2019 budget, I can tell you that not much changed from what President Muhamamdu Buhari presented to us on 18 December, 2018, and what we have eventually passed today. “The crude oil production remains 2.3 million barrel per day;, the oil price benchmark remains US$60 per barrel; and the exchange rate retains N305 per US dollar. “The only thing that changed was the deficit, which was jacked up from 1.096, mainly because of the severance benefits ‎of outgoing lawmakers and their aides, which cumulatively amount to N24.6 billion,” he said.
