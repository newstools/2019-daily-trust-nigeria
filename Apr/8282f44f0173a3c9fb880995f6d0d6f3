The Kwara State House of Assembly has rejected the request of the Transition Committee set up by the governor-elect, AbdulRahman AbdulRasaq, for handover note on the activities of the assembly. The House, on Thursday, refused the request in its resolution after a two-day debate on a letter of request sent to it by the committee. Daily Trust reports that with the exception of Saheed Popoola who remained in the APC and got re-elected, all the remaining 23 members who defected to the PDP had been defeated during the recent House of Assembly elections. The outgoing Speaker, Dr. Ali Ahmad, while reading the resolution on not to give any handover note to the committee set up by the governor-elect, said the request for handover note of the House by the committee did not conform with democratic tenets. Ahmad described the committee’s request as “anomalous” as it amounted to setting bad precedent for the incoming lawmakers in the state. “The Kwara State House of Assembly noted that the letter from the representatives of the incoming executive requesting for handover note or brief from the assembly was anomalous,” he said. The speaker said the autonomy of the legislature must be guarded, adding that to accede to the request of the transition committee would “kill the independence of the legislature.” Earlier during the debate, the members unanimously condemned the series of letters from the transition committee requesting the House to furnish it with the handover note.
