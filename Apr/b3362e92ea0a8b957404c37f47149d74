Some residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) are taking advantage of the Easter celebration to hang out with family members and friends. The residents, who were having fun at the Millennium Park, Abuja on Monday, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that Nigerians, especially workers, should make out time, hang out and relax with loved ones. According to them, going out and other forms of entertainment, should be done more often and not only during festive periods. One of the fun seekers, Mrs Ngozi Eze, said Easter marked the resurrection of Jesus Christ and it was the foundation of Christian belief. “Easter is the foundation of Christian faith, it is a special period for sober reflection on the essence of our existence. “The lessons from Easter and the Lent period must not be lost in our quest for worldly satisfaction. “These are attributes of sacrifice that Jesus Christ made for the salvation of human kind,” she said. Eze added: “The virtues, knowledge, values and forgiveness associated with the unique part of our existence should be imbibed by all. Having fun also helps our kids to be educationally, morally and socially sound and should not be restricted to festivities alone.” Another fun seeker, Mr Emmanuel Godwin, said Easter is a season of love. “This is a season of love, joy, happiness and everything good. I advise people to hang out. I am happy at the turn out of people and some are still yet to come,” he said. Godwin said having fun in places like Millennium Park would help promote peace and unity in the country. Kid fun seeker Joy Idowu said she was happy going out and urged others to tell their parents to take them out. “Fun centres are not only meant for kids, parents can also use the opportunity to ease stress and bond with families,” she said.
