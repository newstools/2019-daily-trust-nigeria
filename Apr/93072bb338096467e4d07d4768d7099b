Theresa May has responded to criticism from her own MPs over talks with Jeremy Corbyn by saying all MPs have a responsibility to deliver Brexit. The PM said the public “expect us to reach across this House to find a way through this”. Mr Corbyn said he welcomed the PM’s “willingness to compromise to resolve the Brexit deadlock”. The PM’s move to hold talks has angered some Brexiteers, with two ministers resigning over it. Chris Heaton-Harris became the latest to quit on Wednesday afternoon, claiming his job at the Department for Exiting the European Union had become “irrelevant” if the government is not prepared to leave without a deal. Wales Minister Nigel Adams also resigned his role on Wednesday morning, saying the government was at risk of failing to deliver “the Brexit people voted for”. The PM met Mr Corbyn before holding talks with Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford.
