Bayelsa State Governor Henry Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa urged politicians in the state to be mindful of their actions. He said they should not turn the state into another theatre of war because of the November governorship election in the state. In his Easter message signed by the State Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mr Daniel Iworiso-Markson, Dickson said his administration was focused on finishing strong and conducting a peaceful and seamless transition. He called on Nigerians to continue to live together in love, peace and unity as those were the attributes that Christ lived and died with. Dickson stressed that the principal objective of the teaching of Jesus Christ is love and forgiveness. He said: “If we truly love ourselves, there will be no political killings, brigandage, armed banditry, as it is being experienced in some parts of the country. If there is genuine love among us, this country will be better for it.” He also restated his commitment to the security of lives and property as well as the socio-economic development of the state.
