Some passengers have commended the integrity and professionalism demonstrated by Dana Air security team over the discovery of valuable items forgotten on-board its aircraft in recent times. A passenger on one of the airline’s flights from Abuja to Lagos left a bag containing $5,000 and other valuables. On getting to Victoria Island, he reportedly noticed he was not with the bag, and so he went back to the airport, met the security team, which confirmed the item was found. He proved ownership of the items; filled necessary forms and got his missing items back immediately. He thanked the security team for displaying a high level of integrity and professionalism in handling an issue that involved hard currency. He also appreciated the staff for changing the negative narrative about Nigerians. Another passenger, Musa Anasemi, who forgot a Nigerian passport with a valid US visa, said he did not have an idea where he left the passport, but that after about nine days, he decided to check with the airline. He got his passport back. He was full of gratitude and praises for the airline and the security staff that found the item and declared it. Commenting on the development, the Media and Communication Manager of Dana Air, Kingsley Ezenwa, said, “There have been many cases of lost and recovered items like phones, ipads, huge sums of money, passports with valid visas and lots of valuable items.” Kingsley explained that the airline conducted due diligence in recruitment across board and “has invested heavily in training and retraining of staff”, adding that, “We also try our best to keep staff happy in our little way; and these are the results.” Passengers hail Dana over recovery of $5,000, other valuables The taxi driver who saved me The taxi driver who saved me
