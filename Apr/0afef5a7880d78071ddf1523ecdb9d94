Projects in 2018 budget were not abandoned by communications ministry, the Minister, Adebayo Shittu, has said. The minister in a statement yesterday said the fact of the matter is that contracts award/execution were delayed to address  petitions from participants in the procurement process which have saved the Federal Government the sum of six hundred million naira (N600million) from review committee set up by him. He said: ‘’The attention of the Ministry has been drawn to the misleading press report that “Senate Berates Communications Ministry for Abandoning 104 projects in 2018”. ‘’This is not a true picture of the situation and the statement is unfortunate because no projects have commenced that would have been abandoned by the Ministry of Communications. ‘’The Ministry of Communications has executed projects approved by the National Assembly based on the funds made available to it and has not abandoned any 104 projects in 2018. ‘’It is on record that budget approval was delayed for about seven months in 2018 which cascaded into the budget implementation of every Ministry/Departments/Agencies (MDAs) in 2018. ‘’As we are all aware, the process of procurement has laid down rules and regulations which has nine essential steps such as procurement plan, adequate appropriation, advertisement, transparent pre-qualification, tender, bid submission/opening, bid evaluation, tender board approval and contract award/execution/ project implementation which have to be adhered to strictly, by the Ministerial Tenders Board (MTB) headed by the Permanent Secretary’’. Not only that, he said, many of the projects are rollover projects from the previous year which have not been fully funded due to the paucity of funds.
