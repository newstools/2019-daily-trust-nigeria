The Director-General, Department of State Services (DSS), Yusuf Bichi, has called for better cooperation between security agencies to tackle security problems in the country. He made this known yesterday while addressing a meeting of the Forum of Spokespersons of Security and Response Agencies at the DSS headquarters in Abuja. Bichi said each agency must bring its wealth of experience and comparative advantage to complement the effort of the others. He noted that inter-agency synergy was necessary to combat the contemporary threats facing the country. He said this was the new paradigm of law enforcement and security management across the world. Bichi told the spokespersons to develop ideas and initiatives that can build trust and promote public confidence in security agencies. In his remarks, the Executive Secretary, Centre for Crisis Communication (CCC) Air Commodore Yusuf Anas (retd.), said the FOSSRA was established to enhance the communication between the security agencies and the public.
