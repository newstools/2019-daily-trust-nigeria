Community leaders in Owo, Yewa South local government, Ogun State, yesterday demanded justice on the alleged killing of their traditional ruler, Oba Patrick Fasinu, who was murdered about two years ago. Daily Trust recalls that Fasinu, who had gone for a meeting of traditional rulers in Ilaro, Ogun State, in July 2017, was waylaid and hacked to death with axes by suspected assassins. The late monarch was said to have dropped off his driver along the way and was heading home when he was killed. The Vice-Chairman of Owo Forum, Mrs Aghelegin Comfort Olayinka, who led some leaders and members of the community in a protest in Abeokuta yesterday, expressed concern that “nothing has been done to ensure justice” over Fasinu’s murder. The protesters carried placards with various inscriptions like, ‘We demand justice not mayhem’, ‘Olowo’s throne is not for sale’, Obas in Ogun State come to our aid’ and ‘Gov Amosun, save the people of Owoland’. Olayinka expressed the community’s indisposition to an alleged plan by the state government to impose a new traditional ruler on the community when the case on Fasinu’s murder before the court has not been dispensed with.  She called on the state government to wade into the matter to avoid violence in the area. Olayinka said, “Since the killing of the Olowo of Owoland in 2017, nothing has been done. Those in detention over the killing, including the prime suspect, had been released on bail. We want the government to wade into the matter and ensure justice is done.”  Ogun monarch’s murder: Family accuses police of shielding prime suspect, others Residents protest, seek removal of  Ogun Monarch, Chiefs Customs officers killed our subjects, Ogun monarchs allege
