The PDP has asked INEC to withdraw the certificate of return given to candidate of the APC, Chief Orji Uzor Kalu, as “purported winner” of the Abia North senatorial poll. PDP also requested INEC to conduct rerun in all the polling units and wards where votes were cancelled in the senatorial zone. The PDP Zonal Chairman for Abia North, Hon. Matthew Ibe, told newsmen yesterday in Abuja that the party would not relent until its “stolen mandate” was recovered. The party claimed that it had overwhelming evidence to expose the alleged widespread manipulation of votes and result of the election. “This is the height of impunity and rascality for a man who was never returned in an election to be issued with the certificate of return. “Kalu only scored the highest number of votes by fraudulently allocating figures to himself, but still at that, the 10,000 votes margin of win remains a far cry from the over 38,000 total number of cancelled votes. “It is only a question of time. Our candidate’s stolen mandate will be restored,” he assured.
