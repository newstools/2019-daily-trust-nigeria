Airline and ground handling staff are facing intense scrutiny over recent revelations that some bags of passengers were being wrongly tagged to conceal drugs, Daily Trust reports. Chairman, Presidential Committee on Elimination of Drug Abuse, Buba Marwa had recently alleged that some drug suspects had their bags wrongly tagged by airline workers working in cahoots with ground handling officials. But the case of one Zainab Aliyu, a student being detained in Saudi Arabia after her bag was allegedly tampered with and stuffed with drugs, was said to have given credence to the allegation of “unholy” alliance between some airline and ground handling workers. Daily Trust reports that though the Presidency had intervened to secure the release of Zainab and save her from execution in Saudi Arabia, attention is being shifted to unearthing the “unscrupulous elements” working with ground handling companies. Nigeria has two major ground handling companies – the NAHCo and SAHCO responsible for processing passengers’ baggage. Foreign airline representatives who spoke with our correspondent exonerated the carriers, saying baggage handling is solely the responsibility of ground handling agencies. “Yes I can tell you we are beefing searchlight on baggage handlers and airline workers because of the strong suspicion that they both conspire to implicate some passengers as was found out in the case of Zaynab”, a source close to the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency said.
