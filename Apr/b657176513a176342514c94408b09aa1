Members of The City Club Abuja (TCCA) have donated food and groceries to Hope for Survival Orphanage in Gishiri, Abuja. The president of TCCA, Ariyo Maiye, said the donation was to provide succour to the less privileged. “This outreach was funded by individual contributions from within our club. This marks our first outreach activity and we have a few more planned. We bought groceries and food items for the orphanage. We also identified the case of a baby that needs dialysis for a period of one week to see how it responds to it,” he said. He said there are plans to donate to more orphanages and Internally Displaced Persons in the FCT. The orphanage’s administrator, Cephas Thaddeaus, described the visit as unexpected and the ‘most bountiful’ donation they had received since inception of the orphanage. “Lots of items were brought for the upkeep of the children. We sincerely did not expect this today. We are quite grateful. The children were so happy,” he said.
