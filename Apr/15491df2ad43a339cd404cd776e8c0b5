The Zamfara Government says it will recruit 1,700 local charmers in addition to the 8,500 members of Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) recruited earlier to address security challenges in the state. The state Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy, Alhaji Bello Dankande, said this in Gusau, on Wednesday, at a security meeting with traditional rulers, Fulani leaders and local government council chairmen in the state. The state government had, last year, recruited 8,500 members of CJTF as part of measures to tackle the security challenges facing the state. He said government came up with the policy to recruit local charmers, considering the increase in security challenges in the state. “In each of the 17 emirates, we are going to recruit 100 local charmers in addition to the 500 recruited per emirate earlier. “We are going to recruit other personnel from each emirate to monitor filling stations to ensure that fuel did not get to the bandits in the forests,’’ he said. According to him, the meeting was organised by the ministry to discuss with Fulani leaders and other stakeholders, especially traditional rulers and local government chairmen on how to address the challenges. “If we recall, we earlier met with Fulani leaders in the state; we gave them an assignment to go and consult with their members who are involved in banditry and criminal activities. “If they have any grievances, we can sit down with them and resolve them,” he said.
