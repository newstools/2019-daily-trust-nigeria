The Arewa  Consultative Forum (ACF) yesterday called on Christians and all Nigerians to unite against insecurity and pray for the peaceful coexistence, stability and prosperity of the nation. The ACF made the call in its Easter message signed by its National Publicity Secretary Muhammad Ibrahim Biu. It stated: “It is against such backdrop that ACF wishes to submit that the task of overcoming security challenges posed by kidnapping, insurgency, cattle rustling, banditry and the unnecessary clashes between various ethnic groups cannot be left to government alone. All leaders and Nigerians should come together and live up the synergistic potential against collective challenges for common good. “ACF, therefore, wishes Nigerians, especially Christians, happy celebration and also calls on the governments at all levels and security agencies to intensify their operations and also maintain surveillance in the red alert states until peace and normalcy are restored. But for the needed normalcy to return, all Nigerians must also play their roles of providing support by way of intelligence to the security agencies which would enable them to succeed. “Now that the 2019 general elections are over with winners declared at both the Federal and State levels, the Forum wishes to appeal to our leaders to note that no society thrives on the victory of its faction, but through ultimate reconciliation and inclusiveness. Victory and defeat are never final. The governments should therefore hit the ground running by making Nigerians become one in favour of good governance needed for the good of all.”  Easter: ACF urges all Nigerians to unite against insecurity, pray for peace Eid el-Kabir: ACF urges peace as Ilorin emirate bans carnivals Sallah: ACF cautions against hate speech
