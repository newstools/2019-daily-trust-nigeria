World number three Petra Kvitova beat Estonian Anett Kontaveit 6-3, 7-6(2) to win Stuttgart’s Porsche Grand Prix yesterday for her second title of the year as she prepares for next month’s French Open. Kvitova, a two-time Wimbledon champion, broke her opponent to go 4-2 up in the first set and served out the set a little later on the quick indoor clay courts in Stuttgart. The Czech had to work much harder in the second set as she had to save two set points at 5-4 as Kontaveit had her pinned to the baseline. However, the Estonian, who received a walkover into the final after top seed Naomi Osaka pulled out from their last four clash due to injury, missed her chances and allowed Kvitova to come back.
