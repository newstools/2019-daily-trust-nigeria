Some political groups under the auspices of Northern Youth Coalition (NYC) have kicked against the candidature of Senator Ahmed Lawan, saying the incumbent Senate Majority Leader lacks the needed leadership qualities to preside effectively over the Senate. The coalition’s National President, Comrade Mukhtar Muhammad, in a statement said Lawan had so many controversies and shortcomings that cannot be overlooked at this crucial time of the need to have a transparent leadership at the Senate. Comrade Muhammad said Senator Lawan had not made any meaningful contributions or sponsored masses oriented bills at the 8th Senate. The coalition urged all Senators particularly those from Northern Nigeria to vote Senator Ali Ndume as the next Senate President, adding that Ndume has the required leadership qualities to take the Senate to the next level. “If Ahmed Lawan is allowed to emerge as the next Senate President, it would be a great disservice to the Nigerian electorates who need a vibrant and an independent Legislative arm of government crucial in making laws that would have direct impacts on the masses. “Ahmed Lawan was instrumental to the ouster of Senator Ndume as Leader of the Senate. How can such a scandal be rewarded with Senate Presidency? It is absurd and against the spirit of constitutional democracy which has accountability and transparency as important tenets of its principles,” he said.
