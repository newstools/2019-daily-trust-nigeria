The Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) has commended the Senate for deciding to override President Muhammadu Buhariâ€™s presidential veto on the bill to amend sections 81 and 121 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (1999) as amended. The lead director of the centre, Eze Onyekpere, said Monday in Abuja that the two sections prescribe the timeframe for the presentation of the federal and state budget estimates by the president and governors to the National Assembly and the State Houses of Assembly respectively. He said the amendment (Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 [Fourth Alteration, No. 28] Bill, 2017) proposes that instead of the old order, where the president and governors present the budget estimates at any time in each financial year, they would now be bound to present same not later than 90 days to the end of the financial year.
