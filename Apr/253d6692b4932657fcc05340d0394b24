At least, seven people have been injured after a gas tanker exploded at the premises of Bolek petrol filing station, situated opposite the Benue State University (BSU)â€™s College of Health Sciences in Makurdi, on Monday evening. Daily Trust gathered that the tanker exploded around 6:10pm just few minutes after it discharged gas at the station. It was learnt that the victims of the explosion included two workers of the fuel station, two undergraduates of BSU and three customers, who were waiting to be attended to at the filling station, when the incident occurred. The victims were immediately rushed to Benue State University Teaching Hospital (BSUTH) where they are currently receiving medical attention. A Manager of the Bolek filling station, John Ekpo, told newsmen that the gas tanker was negotiating to exit the premises of the fuel station after discharging its content when it suddenly exploded. Ekpo said people within the vicinity scampered for safety while many motorists helped with their fire extinguishers and the ones owned by the fuel station to put out the fire before it went out of control. One female victim, Pastor Jude Ochife, had her two legs badly burnt while one of the two undergraduates was also said to have suffered severe injury. The affected filing station, as at Tuesday, however remained under lock and key.
