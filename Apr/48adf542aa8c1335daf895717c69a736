Two APC candidates, Abdulwaheed Gbenga Yussuf and Mariam Joy Adeniran, are laying claim to the Kwara State House of Assembly seat for Essa/Shawo/Igbodun constituency in Offa Local Government Area. A gender-based non-governmental organisation, under the aegis of Coalition of Women Associations in Kwara State, has also raised an alarm over alleged attempt to infringe on the rights of women in politics. “Our attention has been drawn to an attempt to cause injury on the womenfolk by struggling to use the court to snatch the mandate of Hon. Mariam Joy Adeniran thereby relegating us to the lowest ebb and allocating zero percent to females in the incoming lawmaking process,” the leader of the group, Ayobola Olupinla, said at a press conference in Ilorin. Adeniran, while speaking, called on men and women of high virtue, the APC National Working Committee (NWC), President Muhammadu Buhari, First Lady Hajiya Aisha Buhari, international organisations and relevant interest groups to rise up to the situation and save Kwara women from what she called gender inequality and discrimination. But Yussuf, on his part, called on the general public to disregard what he described as sentimental campaign being championed by Adeniran.
