A former lawmaker, Dr. Wunmi Bewaji, yesterday, said the ruling APC should be allowed to have its way in deciding the leadership of the 9th National Assembly. Dr. Bewaji, who was the leader of the Alliance for Democracy (AD) caucus in the 5th National Assembly and represented Lagos Mainland Federal Constituency, said international party convention should not be jettisoned in choosing the leaders of the next National Assembly. He spoke with our correspondent in Lagos against the backdrop of the ongoing controversy over the leadership of the National Assembly. The APC favours Sen. Ahmed Lawan as the next senate president and Chairman of the National Assembly, but there were discordant tunes within the party over the choice. The ex-lawmaker who is also the Executive Secretary of Coalition of Democrats for Electoral Reform (CODER), said leadership of the National Assembly could not be “outsourced” from the opposition. He said, “I think the party should be allowed; the tradition has always been to allow the party determine the leadership structure of the National Assembly, and the reason is simple. The party ran on particular policies and programmes sold to the electorate. “Now the party knows its own members. You are not going to outsource that to members of another party because the leadership of the National Assembly is meant to complement and synergise with the elected president. In established democracies, that is the reason for example in the US, unless something personal is found against the nominee of the president, the nominee would be allowed to go by the senate.” Lawmakers intensify tussle over Lagos assembly speakership N/East, N/Central battle for senate presidency APC, lawmakers urged to resolve differences
