The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, stated this, yesterday, while performing the official launch of the FCT Strategic Health Development Plan II, in Abuja. Represented by the secretary, Health and Human Services Secretariat, Adamu Abubakar Bappah, the minister said “the Strategic Plan II was estimated to cost N162,000,000,000 in the five-year period. “The government will make statutory budgetary provisions available, but other financing gaps will be addressed with funding by development partners, World Bank assisted programmes, private sector and out of pocket expenditure by end-users at the healthcare facilities,” he said. Bello stressed that FCTA was dedicated to providing effective and affordable healthcare services in Abuja. He said the administration has ensured medical services were offered at Karu and Zuba general hospitals, while  13 primary healthcare clinics have been constructed and 19 others rehabilitated.
