The Rivers State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Bro. Felix Obuah has congratulated the Governor-elect on what he described as a well deserved and landslide victory. Speaking shortly after the declaration of Governor Wike as the winner of the March 9, 2019 governorship election, Bro. Obuah said the victory has once more put paid to any doubt about God’s infallibility, especially to those who put absolute trust in Him. The State PDP Chairman said the victory is not just victory for Governor Wike and the PDP but indeed a victory for all lovers of true democracy as well as the good people of Rivers State even as he also described it as a litmus test for our democracy. While dedicating the victory to God and “the ever conscientious people of the State”, Bro. Obuah further lauded the victory as unprecedented in the annals of the State, as according to him, it could only take God’s intervention to survive the gang-up and the evil conspiracy by those he described as enemies of the State. “This victory has gone to show that our God is a miracle worker. God has clearly shown that the fervent and heartfelt prayers being offered by Rivers people on daily basis are not in vain.  Truly, he has disappointed all the counsel of Ahithophel including all those who arrogate the place of God to themselves”, Bro. Obuah added. The PDP Chairman said the re-election of Governor Wike should serve as a lesson and reminder to all political office holders not to take the people to whom absolute power belongs for granted and ensure at all times that people-oriented programmes at the grassroots are paramount to bring about the much desired catalyst for social and economic development.
