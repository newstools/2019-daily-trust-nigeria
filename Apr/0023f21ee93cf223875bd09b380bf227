The Executive Secretary of Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) Prof Suleiman Elias Bogoro has expressed dismay over the inability of most Nigerian Professors to access global grants for impactful research due to poor quality of research proposal.  He said in spite of the growing number of Nigerian Professors to about 8000, it borders him that many have low capacity to write fundable research proposal, saying, “We see some of the research proposals coming to TETFund and sometimes you wonder if some of the professors were actually the principal investigators in the proposal, at first reading about 80 percent are gone because they are poor.”  Prof Bogoro stated this on Wednesday at an interactive session with Directors of Research of Nigerian Universities in Abuja, organised by the National Universities Commission, tagged “Bolstering Research Impact and Relevance through Systematic Research Governance in Nigeria. “I have been in some platforms oversees where some Nigerian professors have been invited and they were reluctant to climb the podium because they wanted to get PhD at that stage is the title that borders them not the knowledge.”  “Now they have wangled their way to top professors, but give them the topmost platform in the world they won’t want to climb because they will misrepresent the title they are carrying, this is a challenge to us,” he said.
