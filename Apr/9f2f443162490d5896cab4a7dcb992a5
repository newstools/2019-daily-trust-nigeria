A contender for the speakership of the 9th House of Representatives, Nkeiruka Onyejeocha (APC, Abia), has asked the leadership of APC to reconsider its stand for the sake of equity and allow the South East to produce the next speaker. Onyejeocha, who stated this in Abuja yesterday while briefing newsmen, called on the House Leader, Femi Gbajabiamila (APC, Lagos), to step down for her. She said as a woman who had distinguished herself in private and public life, including 12 years in the House, it was time to support her to become the next speaker to use her skills and experience for national development. “I know that my party, APC, has indicated how it would distribute leadership positions in the 9th Assembly,” she noted. “However, it is important to point out the concerns of my people of South East zone, who are worried that inequitable distribution of the six key political leadership positions would further exacerbate the current lopsidedness and deep divides in the country,” Onyejeocha warned. The three-term lawmaker argued that since the North West and South West already had the positions of presidency and vice presidency respectively, equity demanded that the remaining four key positions be shared among the other four geopolitical zones to ensure balance.
