Imo state governor, Rochas Okorocha, has accused the national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, of turning the party to a “regional party.” Okorocha, who was suspended from the APC over anti-party allegations, spoke to journalists after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House on Monday. “My fear now is that APC might have a serious setback in 2023 because the Oshiomhole’s led executive is actually turning APC into a regional minority party which shouldn’t be because of his mistakes. Right now, in the whole South East, we don’t have an APC governor. “So, if there is any discussion in Nigeria now within the APC governors and President Buhari, there would be nobody from the South East. “This is what the APC chairman has done in the South East. I think it’s a capital attempt to frustrate the efforts of the South East but I appeal to every Nigerian to support the cause of the South East. He said the feud between him and Oshiomhole has not affected his relationship with President Buhari. “As a matter of fact, Buhari is a great man; he is a man of wisdom; a visionary leader. That is why you see some of us going along with him. It’s for what he has upstairs – he can see far that is why he made that declaration in Imo State – ‘vote according to your conscience.’ It was in Imo state that he first use that word.   So my relationship with him is not affected in anyway,” he said. He said he was in the State House to invite President Buhari for the commissioning of over 1,000 projects he has executed in Imo state. He said he did not discuss the issue of his Certificate of Return with the president.
