Cowbells can continue ringing out on a Bavarian farm despite the neighbours’ long-running complaints, a Munich court has ruled. It was the latest setback for a couple from Holzkirchen, a peaceful market town, who first sued five years ago. But they plan to appeal again. They argue that dairy farmer Regina Killer’s cows keep them awake at night. But a leading Bavarian politician, Ilse Aigner, said “the cow – with its bell – is part of our rural way of life”. The couple, who have not been named, also object to the bad smells of manure and the accompanying insects. In court their lawyer had played a recording of the cowbell noise, measuring more than 70 decibels at the couple’s bedroom window. But the court found the evidence unconvincing.
