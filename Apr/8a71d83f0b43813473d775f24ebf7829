A 36-year-old teacher, Abiodun Matthew, has been remanded in prison custody on the order of a chief magistrate court, Ogba, Lagos, for allegedly defiling a four- year-old primary school pupil. While Matthew was charged with assault and defilement, three other female teachers working in the same school as the accused were also charged with allegedly neglecting their role as the guardian to the little girl. The female arraigned teachers were identified as Charity Madumewe, 58; Olubukola Oyinola, 46; and Esther Olawole, 33. The prosecutor, Mr Christopher John, said that all the accused persons were staff members of a nursery and primary school located at Akoka, Yaba, in the Lagos metropolis. Matthew, according to John, allegedly committed the offence within the school premises by luring the little girl into one of the classrooms, removing her panties and forcefully having carnal knowledge of her. He added that the girlâ€™s parents later discovered the injury she had sustained in her private part from the assault and began interrogating her. The girl was then said to have narrated her ordeal to them. The parents then reported the matter to the Gender Section of the police command. The prosecutor asked the court to refer the matter to the Department of Public Prosecution (DPP) to determine the jurisdiction of the matter before the trial would go on. Thus, the magistrate, Mr Peter Nwaka, ordered that Matthew be remanded in prison custody without an option of bail. The court also directed the prosecutor to duplicate the file and send to the DPP for advice. The matter was adjourned till May 9, 2019 for the report of the DPP to ready.
