A Benin-based activist, Comrade Samson Osiomwanta, has called on the state houses of assembly to come up with a law banning governors in their first tenure from seeking re-election. Osiomwanta made the call in Benin on Wednesday while speaking with journalists on his intention to contest the forthcoming governorship election in the state. He said the law became necessary because governors in their first term with the opportunity to seek re-election will not offer their best service for the people, as they are busy  recouping money to prosecute second term. According to him, governors who know that they have only one term to spend in the office will always do their best to deliver on their electioneering promises, adding that  the likes of late Prof. Ambrose Alli and Samuel Ogbemudia whose great achievements have not been surpassed by subsequent governors only spend one tenure. “I am not oblivion of the many problems associated with the state but I want to change the narratives. I think I foresee myself as the masses and a representative of the masses. I know what is going on in the street and I followed my people,” he said. He therefore promised that if given the opportunity, he will run a transparent government and also tackle the scourge of insecurity in the state.
