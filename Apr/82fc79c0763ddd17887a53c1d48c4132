Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue state has assured members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) posted to the state of their adequate security and safety anywhere they may be deployed for their primary assignment. Ortom gave the assurance on Tuesday during the closing ceremony of the 2019 Batch A at the NYSC permanent orientation camp, Wannune in Tarka local government area of the state. The governor who was represented by the Chairman Governing Board of NYSC and the state’s Commissioner for Youth and Sport, Hajia Idi Salamatu, expressed gladness about the positive conducts of the corps members throughout the duration of their orientation course. “I’m hoping that the corps members will give back to the society by dispensing intellectual and humanitarian services selflessly to people of your host communities with the aim of adding value to their lives and ameliorating their plights,” he said. Ortom opined that to be able to do so effectively, corps members must remain diligent in carrying out any assignment which will be given to them. Earlier in his welcome address, the Benue state Coordinator of NYSC, Shicha Joshua Simon, appealed for the reconstruction of the camp’s dilapidated multipurpose hall. Shicha said the state of the hall had deteriorated, saying not only had it negatively affected camp activities such as lectures and skill acquisition trainings but also poses a measure of safety risk to corps members. “We therefore, would be grateful if Your Excellency can kindly intervene and solve this infrastructural deficit that is threatening to render this camp unsuitable for holding orientation programmes,” Shicha appealed.
