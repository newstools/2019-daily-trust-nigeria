Many houses, billboards, trees and other structures have been pulled down by rainstorm in Lokogoma, Galadimawa and some other areas of the FCT. Some residents said the rain which started at 12:00am on Sunday lasted for several hours. A resident, John Adeoye, said three billboards at Sunny Vale and Galadimawa Roundabout were pulled down by the winds that accompanied the rain. Adeoye said, “All those people that put storage tanks by the roadside for sale also recorded losses because some tanks were destroyed during the rain.” He added that welders who displayed gates by the roadside for sale also recorded losses. Another resident in Maccido Royal Estate, Galadimawa, whose house was partly destroyed by the storm, said he had to evacuate his property to other rooms in the bungalow. The resident who would not want to be named, said the storm was severe in the area and that his house was among those which roofs were blown off. Another resident, Okechukwu James, said several rooftops were destroyed by the storm, but that there was no record of collapsed building in his estate. James said the storm was severe before the rain started at midnight, “I was scared at first because it looked as if the roof would be removed. But I thank God that nothing happened. “At a garden at Galadimawa Roundabout, the roof of a temporary structure was destroyed. Another structure in a garden was also destroyed,” he said.
