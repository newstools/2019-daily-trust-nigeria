The Senate on Wednesday resolved to override the veto of President Muhammadu Buhari on the constitution amendment Bill (Bill No. 28) and the Industrial Development (Income Tax Relief) amendment Bill. The two bills were part of the many bills that the president had rejected and forwarded his reasons to the National Assembly. To override the president, the Senate needs at least two-thirds majority, which is 73 senators to endorse the action. The Senate also resolved to rework 11 rejected bills and resend to the president for assent. However, the Senate said it would completely withdraw four bills that the president rejected. The resolutions followed the adoption of the report of a special technical committee chaired by Sen David Umaru (APC, Niger).
