The PDP has warned INEC against plunging the nation into what it termed “monumental crisis.” The PDP said INEC should retrace its steps and obey the Presidential Election Tribunal which ordered it to release the election materials used for the conduct of the February 23, 2019, presidential poll for its candidate, Atiku Abubakar, and his legal team to inspect. The party, in a statement yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said INEC was allegedly standing in the way of justice and frustrating the PDP’s petition. “The continued refusal of INEC to release the electoral materials to the PDP and our legal team is completely provocative and shows that the commission is working in cahoots with the APC and the Buhari Presidency to frustrate the PDP, our candidate, Atiku Abubakar, and majority of Nigerians from retrieving our mandate at the tribunal. “INEC and the APC are apprehensive that the materials, particularly the forms EC8D and EC40G covering the nation in addition to the report of the Smart Card Readers used in the presidential election will show at the tribunal that the PDP and Atiku Abubakar clearly won the presidential election,” the PDP said.
