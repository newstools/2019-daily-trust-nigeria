President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), Mr Rasaq Jayeola, yesterday, described the forensic bill before the National Assembly as victory for professionalism and accountability in the country. Jayeola, who was speaking on the institute’s forthcoming 1st Annual Accountants Technology (AAT) summit to be held in Lagos next Thursday, said the bill, if passed, will further strengthen investors’ confidence in the Nigerian economy as well as support the government’s drive in its fight against corruption. “Internationally, people are clamoring for foreign investors, how will they come if we are already compromising standards. In Nigeria of today, it is important that we face the reality of the way things are done internationally. That is the only thing that can help sustain the way and manner people will embrace us and we will not turn to laughing stock,” he stated. He said technology has moved from being a tool for making businesses and jobs efficient and for business survival, stressing that accountants must not just appreciate technology, but be very versed in deploying different forms of technology for business survival and growth.
