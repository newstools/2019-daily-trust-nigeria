The Senate has urged security agencies to give special security cover to foreign workers and tourists in view of the killing of a Briton, Ms Faye Mooney, at the Kajuru Castle, Kaduna State, on Friday. Senators also urged the government to set up an inter-agency task force to tackle cases of banditry and kidnapping in Kaduna, Katsina, Zamfara and Niger states. Members of the Red Chamber urged security agencies to intensify the search for the perpetrators of the attack in Kajuru Castle, which led to the killing of Mooney and a Nigerian, Mathew Oguche. They equally resolved to invite the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mohammed Adamu Abubakar to brief them on the actions taken against kidnappings and banditry so far. Adopting a motion by Sen Shehu Sani (PRP, Kaduna) and over 100 others, the Senate urged security agencies to immediately deploy the use of drones and interceptors in tracking kidnappers asking for ransom. The Senate said the various telecommunications companies in the country should provide security agencies with information in areas where there are kidnappings, noting that community leaders, traditional rulers and all stakeholders should cooperate with security agencies.
