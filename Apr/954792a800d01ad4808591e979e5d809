The Forum of Newly Elected APC Members, with 164 membership, has backed Femi Gbajabiamila as the consensus candidate of the ruling APC for the 9th Assembly speakership. The forum, in a statement signed by its Chairman, Hon. Tunji Olabunmi Ojo, and Director General, Hon. Dunkwu Nnamdi Chamberlain, said zoning was between the North and the South. According to the forum, APC zoned the presidency to the North, the vice presidency to the South, senate presidency to the North and now the speakership to the South. They argued that those from the North Central agitating for the speakership were insincere as the North could not produce the senate president and speaker at the same time. The forum said they expected all the APC elected members to respect the position of the party on the zoning of the speakership as they were products of the party. The members-elect of the House of Representatives said it would be difficult for them to go against the wishes of the party and President Muhammadu Buhari. The APC national leadership had on Tuesday endorsed the candidature of Majority Leader of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, for the position of speaker. But some party members, especially from the North Central, are bent on producing the Speaker of the 9th Assembly. Part of the statement read, “Politics in this country is played along the line of North and South. North Central is North, North West is North and North East is North. So, the speakership has been zoned to the South. When we zoned the Presidency to the North, North West produced the President. So, for those talking about zoning, zoning in this country is done North/South.
