The board of directors of the institution led by Mosun Belo-Olusoga had proposed a final dividend of 25 kobo per ordinary shares, totalling N7.23 billion, which equals the interim dividend of 25k per ordinary share earlier paid at mid-year. Meanwhile, the bank, alongside its subsidiaries, has posted N95 billion as profit after tax (PAT) for the year.
