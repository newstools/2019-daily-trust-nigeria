The Dean, Faculty of Management Sciences of the University of Abuja, Prof. Peter Maidoki, has urged matriculating students of the institution to imbibe good character while pursuing their academics. Maidoki gave the advice during the 2018/2019 matriculation ceremony of the university in Gwagwalada on Saturday. He said the institution was known for its uncompromising stand on indiscipline, cultism, examination malpractice and academic dishonesty. He said the university would not condone actions which contravened its regulations or behaviour that would portray it in a bad light. “Therefore, I urge the matriculating students, to take their studies seriously to enable them graduate with flying colours and impact meaningfully in the society,” he said. The faculty dean further advised the new students to make time to engage in sports and scholarly lectures in order to enhance their academic performance. Speaking on behalf of other matriculating students, Miss Awetu Tadanyigbe, thanked God for the opportunity given them to study at the institution, promising to be law abiding. She, however, called on the school management to provide a conducive environment for students by equipping the library with adequate books and research facilities for learning.
