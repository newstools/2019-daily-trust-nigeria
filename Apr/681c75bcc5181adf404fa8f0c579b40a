The PDP in Sokoto State has denied alleged victimisation of civil servants perceived to be sympathetic to the opposition APC. In a statement, the state PDP Chairman, Alhaji Ibrahim Milgoma, described the allegations as lies. “Our party, as well as all the entire people in Sokoto State are aware that these allegations by the APC are actually their post-election blueprint if they had won. “It is common knowledge that the APC planned a massive sack of civil servants who did not support their party and targeted many of them for physical assault and other forms of humiliation,” he alleged. The PDP also flayed the claim by the APC that it received the support of 80 per cent of civil servants as ridiculous. The only few civil servants opposed to the Tambuwal administration are those who rejected his accountability and prudent style of leadership in contrast to Wamakko’s extravagant and wasteful regime during which public funds were diverted and splashed recklessly on the streets. “Tambuwal’s government owes nothing to its workers, having been prompt in salaries and even providing salary advance in periods of need. The sale of all government quarters to occupants, a majority of who are civil servants. “Workers enjoyed loans and training during Tambuwal’s administration which have improved their capacity for service and their future endeavours,” he added.
