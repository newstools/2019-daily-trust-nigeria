About 77 trainees under the Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) were presented with starter packs and other items in Gwagwalada on Saturday. The managing director/chief executive officer of Abuja Enterprise Agency (AEA), Malam Mohammed Arabi Tukur, while presenting the items to the beneficiaries, urged them to use the items for the purpose they were given to them. “And it is on this note that as we are giving out these items to you, we urge you to make judicious use of them. Use them for the purpose they are intended. “On no account should any one of you sell whatever we are giving you today. We have given them to you so that you can use them to  build yourselves,” he said. He warned that the agency would not hesitate to blacklist any beneficiary involved in selling the items they received from the agency. Speaking earlier, the managing director of AEA had noted that MSMEs are the engine for economic growth which, he said, required adequate institutional support if the country must compete favourably in the growth process of the nation. He explained that the idea of Business 360 was to bring business regulatory bodies, service providers, owners and developers towards creating synergy that would be beneficial to the growth of business in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).
