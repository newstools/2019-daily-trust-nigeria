The domestic equities market extended its losses to the second trading session of the week on the back of sustained losses in NIGERIAN BREWERIES (-9.7%), NESTLE (-3.5%) and UNILEVER (-8.5%) which saw N169bn wiped off investors’ wealth as market capitalisation fell to N11.4tn. As a result, the Benchmark Index shed 1.0% to 30,226.7 points while year to date (YTD) loss further dipped to -3.8%. Activity level was mixed as value traded advanced by 23.3% to N4.5bn while volume traded declined by 78.2% to 376.5m units.

The Insurance index advanced the most by 0.9% as investors took position in NEM (+5.0%) and CUSTODIAN (+0.82%) while the Industrial index advanced marginally by 0.1% as gains in DANGCEM (+1.1%) offset sustained losses in BETAGLASS (+10.0%). On the flipside, the Consumer Goods index further declined by 3.8% following sustained profit taking activities in NIGERIAN BREWERIES (-9.7%), NESTLE (-3.5%) and UNILEVER (-8.5%). Likewise, the Oil and Gas index and the Banking index shed 1.8% and 1.1% respectively due to sustained losses in OANDO (-7.8%), FORTE(-9.9%), UBA (-2.6%) and ETI (-2.0%). Investors’ sentiment as measured by market breadth weakened to 0.4x from 0.8x recorded in yesterday’s session as 10 stocks advanced against 28 stocks that declined.

Analyst at Afinvest said: “While we expect this negative performance recorded thus far to persist in subsequent trading sessions, we do not rule out the possibility of an upturn in the performance of the Benchmark index as investors continue to take position in fundamentally attractive stocks.’’ Foreign investors’ selloffs trigger NSE loss of N194bn Investors gain N30bn at stock market Profit taking pushes market down by N146.7bn
