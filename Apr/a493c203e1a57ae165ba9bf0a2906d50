Climate change activists glued themselves to a train and others chained themselves to Jeremy Corbyn’s home in a third day of protests. Extinction Rebellion protesters have been blocking traffic at Marble Arch, Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Oxford Circus since Monday. Earlier, three activists were glued to a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) train at Canary Wharf, causing minor delays. Four people also glued themselves together at the Labour leader’s home. The activists, who also used a bike lock to attach themselves to Mr Corbyn’s north London house, said they supported him but wanted the Labour Party to go further than declaring a “climate emergency”. After ending their protest Tracee Williams, one of the group, said she did not think the action was a “misstep but whether we’d do it again, I’m not so sure”. Jeremy Corbyn left his home but declined to meet or speak to any of the protesters. Easter eggs and flowers from the group, which had been taken into Mr Corbyn’s home earlier, were later returned.
