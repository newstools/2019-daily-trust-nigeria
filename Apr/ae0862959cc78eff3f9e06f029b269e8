Mouka Limited, one of Nigeria’s manufacturer of mattresses and other bedding products, has launched an innovative range of insect repellents into the Nigerian market. The Chief Executive Officer of Mouka, Raymond Murphy, said the launch of Mouka Mozzi Insect Repellents which create a protective halo from mosquitoes, is the company’s contribution towards the global campaign against malaria. The three newly introduced products, he explained, are Mouka Mozzi soak and dry, mattress spray, and textile and fabric spray. According to Murphy, in addition to Mosquitoes, Mouka Mozzi also provides protection from bedbugs, mould, bacteria spores, spiders, cockroaches and dust mites. “With each application, a consumer can enjoy 24 hours protection for up to 3 months which is not possible with insecticides,” he further explained. Dr Omoniyi Kayode Yemitan, who conducted the chemical evaluation, efficacy and toxicological assessment of Mouka Mozzi, endorsed the products as safe for all members of the family including pregnant women and young children, adding that the active ingredient in Mouka Mozzi is extracted from plants which makes it non-hazardous for humans. The representative of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) Chairman in Lagos, Dr. Sodipo Oluwajimi, expressed admiration for Mouka’s indigenous feat, adding that the NMA would be willing to endorse the innovation as it joins Mouka in its resolve to tackle the malaria scourge.
