The National Youth Service Corps has threatened to withdraw corps members from Bayelsa State over incessant attacks on them. NYSC Director-General Major-General Suleiman Kazaure said this yesterday when he visited the 2019 batch A corps members at the NYSC orientation camp at Kaiama in Kolokuma/Opokuma Local Government Area of the state. Kazaure was reacting to the last two weeks’ killing of two corps members at Swali in Yenagoa. He said: “Corps members are the national assets on national assignment; if nothing is done by the state government about the killing of corps members, we will withdraw corps members from serving in Bayelsa State. “I have come to see the 2019 Batch ‘A’ corps members in the camp and to assess some the facility in the camp but our major concern here is the safety of this young people. “I want to draw the attention of the Governor Seriake Dickson because he is chief security officers of the state. So, there is need for him to do the needful in terms of security of the corps members.” 2019: Don’t soil our integrity, NYSC DG warns Corps Members in Abia 2019 elections: Be unbiased — NYSC DG tells corps members Drowning of 9 NYSC members
