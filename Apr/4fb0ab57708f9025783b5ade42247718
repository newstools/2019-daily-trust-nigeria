A banana artwork was removed from display by Poland’s national gallery sparking a social media protest. The 1973 video “Consumer Art” by artist Natalia LL, shows a woman eating the fruit. It had been on display at the National Museum in Warsaw for several years but was taken down last week after the museum’s new head, Jerzy Miziolek, was summoned to the ministry of culture. The museum head announced, however, that the video would not be reinstated until 5 May, when the gallery is due to be rearranged.
