Alhaji Usman Mayo, who was abducted and paid N100million ransom but still being held, has told his family not to give any amount to his abductors again. It was gathered that his abductors had yesterday forced him to call his family to pay additional N100million ransom for his release. It was further gathered that Alhaji Usman Mayo told his family to the hearing of his abductors on telephone that not a single Kobo should be paid again. A family source, Mallam Ibrahim, told Daily Trust that Alhaji Mayo as he is popularly called in Takum had told his mother to forgive him as he rather prefers to die in the hand of his abductors than instruct his family to release money to his abductors again. “Please don’t sell any of my property to give my abductors again; I’m ready to die. Let my abductors kill me if they like,” Alhaji Mayo was said to have told his family. It was gathered that the Takum-based businessman was abducted last month just as his family had already paid N100million to his abductors but they refused to release him. The family of the businessman thought he had been killed but were surprised to receive his call yesterday. When contacted, the spokesman of Taraba State Command, DSP David Misal, said he was just briefed by the Divisional Police Officer of Takum on the issue adding that he was not informed about the latest development.
