The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Corps Marshal, Boboye Oyeyemi, yesterday offset the N200,000 medical bill of an accident victim, Durojaye Abiodun, at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Abeokuta, Ogun State. Boboye, who was represented by the Sector Commander in Ogun, Clement Oladele, gave the money to the patient at the hospital, saying he got to know about the young man’s predicament through the social media. Oladele explained that Abiodun, 25, was walking along the Aro Neuropsychiatrist Hospital road in Abeokuta sometime last December when he was knocked down by a driver and had a fractured leg. “The reckless driver, who wanted to dodge a pothole, knocked him down. The driver stopped, picked him up and brought him to the Federal Medical Centre. “We were still doing our Easter patrol when the Corps Marshal, Boboye Oyeyemi, got to know about the victim through the social media that he needed assistance from Nigerians to offset his medical bills. “Mr Oyeyemi then said that in the spirit of Easter, we should investigate, and if it is true, consider what we can do. We discovered that his bill was almost close to N300,000. “The Corps Marshal said I should discuss with the FMC if they can give a discount. They initially gave us a 30 per cent discount, which was gracious enough, but they eventually reduced the money to N200,000.”  The FMC Medical Director, Professor Adewale Musa-Olomu, commended Boboye for the gesture with words that the Corps Marshal had displayed good leadership quality. Abiodun also thanked the FRSC for its support, saying he was the happiest man on earth. “My medical treatment was completed on March 15, 2019 but we were unable to pay my medical bills. I have been in the hospital since December and am so happy that a good Nigerian has settled my medical bills,” he said.
