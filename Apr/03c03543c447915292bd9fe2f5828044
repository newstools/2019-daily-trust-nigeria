The national leadership of National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has rejected the alleged anti-poor and anti-masses recruitment requirements of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). Mr Adeyemi Azeez, NANS National Public Relations Officer (PRO), made the position of the students’ body known in a statement on Sunday in Abuja. NANS alleged that it was a deliberate and well structured resolve to play out many graduates, especially those from the poor background. According to him, it is no longer news, that regular occurrences of incessant strikes have long marred the education sector of the country. “Therefore, ordinarily an undergraduate that applied for a four or five year programme will eventually end up staying nine or 10 years on campus pursuing a bachelor degree. He, however, called on NNPC within a 72 hours ultimatum to withdraw all alleged anti-poor and anti-masses conditions.(NAN) NNPC Recruitment: Remove age limit or risk protests, NANS warns Campaign group faults Atiku’s plan to sell NNPC Kachikwu/Baru feud raises fresh turmoil in oil sector
