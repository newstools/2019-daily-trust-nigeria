President Muhammadu Buhari has charged the Attorney General of the Federation and Minster of Justice Abubakar Malami, to intervene in the case of Zainab Aliyu, a student of Maitama Sule University in Kano, who is currently being detained by Saudi Arabian authorities on alleged drug related offences. This was made known in a statement issued by Abdulrahman Balogun, the media aide to Hon. Abike Dabiri-Erewa, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Foreign Affairs and Diaspora, yesterday. It was made known that the president gave the directive two weeks ago when the case came to his attention, and assured that headway was being made in Zainab’s case, with two other similar cases as well. Mrs. Dabiri Erewa made it known that Zainab has yet to be charged for drug courier offences, and that a strong legal case is being made to the Saudi authorities. “My office has been working with the AGF as well as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in that regard,” she said. Zainab had departed Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport with her mother Maryam Aliyu and sister Hajara, and was later arrested for allegedly carrying illegal substances in luggage bearing her name tag.
