A tribunal has suspended a Kebbi-based doctor from practice for six months after finding him guilty of negligence in misdiagnosing a pregnant patient. In April 2017, Dr Jamilu Muhammad, working at Martha Bamaiyi General Hospital in Zuru, Kebbi, “erroneously diagnosed” that his patient Fatima Danjuma’s baby had died in the womb and needed to be evacuated, the tribunal of the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria ruled. The foetus was found to be alive while the surgery was already on and a prolapsed upper limb already amputated. A petition for “unethical behaviour” was filed with the council in May 2017, and an investigative panel found the doctor had a case to answer before a tribunal, which has the status of a high court. In judgement delivered at the MDCN council chambers in Abuja, the tribunal chairman Abba Hassan, ruled Muhammad conducted himself “infamously in a professional respect contrary” to the council’s code of medical ethics. Muhammad was suspended pending the outcome of his trial. At trial, he pleaded guilty and asked for leniency. But the tribunal noted he had been on suspension for a period longer than the six-month sentence and “deemed to have served and exhausted the prescribed term of suspension” imposed by his sentence. He is one of 14 doctors facing trial at the tribunal for a range of offences. Trial continues for nine doctors at Asaba Medical Centre to defend themselves against charges of gross misconduct and negligence in managing a pregnant patient. All nine have pleaded not guilty.
