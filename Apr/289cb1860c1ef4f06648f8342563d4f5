Senator-elect for Kaduna Central Zone, Malam Uba Sani has urged Nigerians to use the occasion of the Easter celebration to mend political fences. Uba Sani, while congratulating Nigerians and the Christian community, urged deep reflection on the values that bind Nigeria together. The Senator-elect said Nigerians should see the Easter as a season of joy and sober appreciation of the solid bond of brotherhood that unites humanity under a merciful God. He said the Easter, which is marked in remembrance and celebration of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, is a very important and hugely significant event. “The death and resurrection of Jesus Christ is the pillar on which the Christian faith stands. Jesus Christ gave his life as a sacrifice for the remission of sins. His sacrifice signifies undiluted love, selflessness, forgiveness and compassion,” the Senator-elect said.
