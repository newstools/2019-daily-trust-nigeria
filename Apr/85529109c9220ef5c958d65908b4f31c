The Senate on Wednesday postponed the consideration of the 2019 budget to next week due to non-availability of details. The Senate Appropriation Committee headed by Sen Mohammed Danjuma Goje (APC, Gombe) had last Thursday laid the budget report on the floor of the Senate. The budget consideration and passage was listed on the Senate Order Paper for Wednesday. However, when senators reached the item, it was observed that there were no printed copies of the budget report. It was also observed that both Goje and his deputy Sen Sunny Ogbouji (APC, Ebonyi), were not on the floor. But the main reason for the postponement was the non-availability of the budget details. Senate President Bukola Saraki consequently directed that copies of the budget report should be made available to senators before Monday so that the Senate would pass it next Tuesday.
