The allegation that the presidential candidate of the PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, is not a citizen of Nigeria will not stop him from reclaiming his mandate through the court, his associate, Alhaji Mohammed Abdullahi Sugar, has said. Alhaji Sugar stated this while reacting to the claim by the APC that Atiku is not a citizen of Nigeria by birth and ought not to have even been allowed in the first place to contest the election. “It’s not only disgraceful but unfortunate that they are saying this. It wouldn’t take us anywhere and it won’t stop his victory at the court,” Sugar said. “It’s a pity that they are portraying the country in bad light. How will you be saying that the person that was our country’s vice president for eight years is not a citizen? Before becoming the vice president, as you know, he had occupied various positions in the country. Remember, he was in the customs before venturing into politics. Why all the allegations now,” Sugar asked. He said Atiku was not worried about the allegation, saying, “His priority now is how to reclaim the stolen mandate of the masses. We are very hopeful that he would emerge victorious at the end of the case in court.” While urging Nigerians to be calm, he said the country would be better when Atiku took over from President Muhammadu Buhari. “The judiciary should have the fear of God and ensure that justice prevails on the matter. The country’s democracy would be better if the judiciary discharges its function well,” he said.
