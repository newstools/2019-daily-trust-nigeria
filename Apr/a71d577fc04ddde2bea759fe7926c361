Prime Minister Theresa May has insisted she had to reach out to Labour in a bid to deliver Brexit or risk letting it “slip through our fingers”. The PM said there was a “stark choice” of either leaving the European Union with a deal or not leaving at all. And shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey says if no-deal became an option Labour would consider voting to cancel Brexit. Some Tories have criticised the PM for seeking Labour’s help on her deal.
