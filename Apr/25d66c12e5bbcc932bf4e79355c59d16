President Muhammadu Buhari has condoled the Yaro family on the passing of businessman and philanthropist, Alhaji Ahmadu Yaro. A presidential spokesman, Malam Garba Shehu, in a statement in Abuja on Wednesday, said the President also commiserated with the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ibrahim Salisu Buhari on the death of his father, Alhaji Salisu Buhari Daura. Buhari recalled that one of the abiding passions of Yaro was his zeal and dedication to entrepreneurship, extending proceeds of his business fortunes to numerous community development initiatives. He said: “As a very successful businessman who spent most of his years in the commercial city of Lagos, Yaro was an embodiment of a true Nigerian, committed to advancing the peaceful co-existence of all, promoting prosperity and stability across regions.” While commiserating with the government and people of Jigawa, the business community in the country on the passing of the elder statesman and humanitarian, the President prayed Allah to comfort the bereaved family, friends and associates, and grant the soul of the departed eternal rest.
