The Speaker of the Zamfara State House Assembly, Sanusi Rikiji, yesterday said no fewer than 50 persons including members of Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) were killed in Zamfara on Tuesday. Mr Rikiji, who revealed this during a condolence visit to Kaura Namoda emirate, attributed the incidence to CJTF confrontation with bandits in a community in Kaura Namoda Local Government Area of the state. The Speaker, who led the state government delegation on the visit, decried the worsening security situation in the state. “We were told that the members of Civilian JTF have mobilised people from Sakajiki community in Kaura Namoda LGA and confronted the bandits in the forest which led to the killing of over 50 persons including members of CJTF,” he said. Mr Rikiji, who is the Chairman of the State Government Relief and Damage Assessment Committee, described the act of the CJTF as unprofessional, saying confronting the bandits is not the duty of CJTF members. Responding, Emir of Kaura Namoda, Muhammad Asha, thanked the state government for the gesture and assured of his palace’s continued support and cooperation with government to address the problem. He said the emirate had embarked on special prayers to seek Allah’s intervention over the security challenges in the state. The Chairman of the council, Lawal Abdullahi, thanked the state government for the assistance to the victims.
