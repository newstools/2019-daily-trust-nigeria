The Court of Appeal, sitting in Akure, has ruled that the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in the last gubernatorial election in Osun State, Ademola Adeleke was qualified to contest the election. The ruling was given in Akure, the Ondo State capital by presiding judge M.A Danjuma and the duo of Justice R.M Abdullahi and P.A Mahmoud. With this development, the controversy over the eligibility of Senator Ademola Adeleke to contest the Osun governorship election may have been put to rest as the Court stroke out the locus standi of the plaintiffs and jurisdiction to hear the matter instituted against his qualification and eligibility to hold the office. The latest judgement has also knocked out the judgement of the Bwari High Court and rendered its conclusion ineffective, null and void with no effect on the candidacy of the September 22nd 2018 guber election The Bwari judgement had contradicted the Osogbo high court verdict by rejecting testimonies of WAEC, an examination body which in a sworn affidavit, confirmed that Ademola Adeleke sat for its examination with attached results. The Osogbo High Court had earlier ruled that it had jurisdiction to hear this matter after an existing High Court judgement had ruled that Senator Adeleke is qualified to contest for the governorship election, having been educated up to secondary school level. The Appeal in Suit no. CA/AK/106/9 between INEC v.
