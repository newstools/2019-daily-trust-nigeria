The Oluwo of Iwoland in Osun State, Oba Abdulrasheed Akanbi, yesterday urged the Federal Government to create an agency to cater for the wellbeing of  senior citizens. He was speaking  in Abeokuta, Ogun State Capital, when the Senior Citizens Care Foundation,  chaired by a former judge of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Bola Ajibola, presented him with a senior citizens’ certificate. The Chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Senator Biyi Durojaye, also received the certificate. Oluwo, while addressing journalists shortly after receiving the award, observed that a number of aged people in the country were lonely and depressed.

Oba Akanbi said he had been committed to assisting the aged in his domain and beyond. The monarch added that he was also making efforts towards creating a home for senior citizens.
