The Senate yesterday resolved to provide N10 billion in the 2019 budget as intervention fund to cater for the internally displaced persons (IDPs) and other persons affected by the activities of armed bandits in Zamfara State. The Senate also urged the Federal Government to set up an adhoc committee to be known as Presidential Initiatives on Zamfara State (PIZAMS), with a 10-year life span to manage the said funds and subsequent allocations and donations‎. While condemning the activities of the bandits, which led to the deaths of many people in the state, the Senate ‎commended “all Nigerians who, irrespective of cultural, religious and tribal differences came out in numbers to show solidarity to the plight of their brothers and sisters in Zamfara State.” Adopting a motion on the matter brought by Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa (APC, Zamfara), members of the Red Chamber decried the wanton killings of Nigerians across the country on a daily basis. ‎‎Leading debate on the motion, Marafa said the activities of armed bandits, cattle rustlers and kidnapping for ransom on villages and communities have remained unabated in the state. ‎He said a conservative estimate of 11,000 male adults have been killed by armed bandits, leaving behind an average of 22,000 widows and an estimated 44,000 orphans. In their separate contributions, senators said the level of insecurity in the country was becoming alarming and that government must take urgent measures to protect the lives of Nigerians.
