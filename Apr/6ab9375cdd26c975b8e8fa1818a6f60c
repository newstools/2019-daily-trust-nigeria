The PDP has asked INEC to “save the nation a serious crisis” by concluding the collation process as well as respecting the will of the people of Rivers State as expressed at the governorship poll on March 9. The party specifically demanded INEC to declare Governor Nyesom Wike as rightful winner of the election without further delay. The PDP, in a statement yesterday, by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, cautioned  the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami (SAN), over an alleged plot to scuttle the collation of results of the poll.
