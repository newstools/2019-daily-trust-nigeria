A clergy, Reverend Moses Tswanya, has attributed the spate of insecurity in the country to unemployment and negligence on the part of the leaders. Tswanya, who is the national president of the United Missionary Church of Africa, said this yesterday at the church headquarters in Ilorin, Kwara State, while fielding questions from journalists on the Easter. He said the leaders had failed to protect the masses. He stressed the need to return to God to arrest the minds of the perpetrators of the dastardly acts. He called on Nigerian churches to promote peace and equity in all their dealings, while the focus of the youth should be redirected from materialism to piety. Tswanya charged the leaders to redesign the country’s security architecture towards taming the security challenges. He also appealed to Christians to repent from sins to get redemption.
