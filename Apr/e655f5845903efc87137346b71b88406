The APC and its governorship candidate in Sokoto State have filed a petition at the election tribunal against the re-election of the PDP candidate, Gov. Aminu Tambuwal. The respondents include the PDP gubernatorial candidate, Gov. Aminu Waziiri Tambuwal, INEC and the PDP. Also, the tribunal granted an ex parte order to allow the APC counsels to inspect the electoral materials used for the polls. Speaking after the tribunal’s sitting, a member of the APC legal team, Bashir Mu’azu Jodi, who commented on behalf of the Lead Counsel, Dr. Alex Izinyon (SAN), said the election of Gov. Tambuwal was being challenged on many cogent grounds. Jodi said it centered majorly on the infraction on the Electoral Act, 2010, as amended, during the March 9, 2019, gubernatorial election, as well as the March 23, 2019, rerun poll. He said the respondents would be served later, adding that “they have two weeks to reply, after which the court will fix a date for hearing.” On the ex parte order, Jodi said the materials to be inspected included various forms, ballot papers, card readers, among others.
