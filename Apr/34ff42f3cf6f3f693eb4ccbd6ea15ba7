The Provost of the Anti-Corruption Academy of Nigerian (ACAN) Sola Akinrinade has called for a national dialogue on eradicating vote buying and enacting specific legislation that would serve as deterrence. He spoke on Thursday in Abuja, during a press conference at the Headquarters of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offenses Commission (ICPC). ACAN is the research and training arm of the ICPC. He said the Academy and its parent body would be hosting the first in its Anti-Corruption Policy Dialogue Series, dedicated to Eradicating Electoral Corruption. He said the dialogues seek to start discussions that will aid the formulation or modification of policies and legislation on topical matters as well as eradicate electoral corruption with its focus on vote buying which is very apt at this critical point. He added that though the 2019 election has been conducted, the matters associated with them will continue to reverberate until the next elections in 2023. He said the contestation over the outcome of elections is a pointer to the need to address foundational issues relating to elections. He stated that the National Anti-Corruption Strategy requires stakeholders to carry out activities to strengthen the electoral process across the country.
