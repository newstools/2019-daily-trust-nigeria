Access Bank Plc says it has so far spent over N1bn in financing of small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) in the health sector and pledged more financing for the sector. The Executive Director, Retail, Access Bank Plc, Mr Victor Etuokwu, stated this yesterday, in Abuja, at a targeted business workshop for health practitioners and investors in the sector organized in partnership with Medical credit fund and JNCI. He said the bank is investing hugely in health care financing because the health sector connects directly to the well-being of citizens. He, however, noted that beyond the heath sector, the bank is also providing more financial support for businesses operating in various sectors of the economy. According to him, that was the first business workshop after the merger with Diamond Bank, noting that the bank remains committed to providing the much needed financial support to businesses. Also commenting, the Business Development Director, Medical Credit Fund, Fisayo Ogunsanya, in a presentation at the event said the health sector has the potential to contribute significantly to the countryâ€™s Gross Domestic Product. He called on entrepreneurs in the sector to take advantage of the opportunities in the external environment by investing in technology that would drive their businesses.
