The Governorship Election Tribunal sitting in Gombe State, yesterday, struck out three petitions challenging the election of Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya as the governor elect on the platform of APC. The petitions were filed by Jungudo Adamu Jungudo of the People for Democratic Change (PDC), Muhammadu Auwal Ibrahim of the All Grassroots Alliance (AGA), and Aliyu Adamu of the Alliance for Social Democrats (ASD). The trio also joined the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Returning Officer for the election. However, counsel to the petitioners, Barr. Abdullahi Abdulkadir, said his clients decided to withdraw the petitions due to ill health and inability to fund the processes. In his response, counsel to Inuwa Yahaya, Barrister Luka Haruna did not oppose the application but filed an affidavit seeking for cost in line with Section 30 of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended). Also, Barr. Caleb Ubale who was counsel to the second respondent, the APC, agreed with the submissions of the first respondent and also sought for cost. Delivering a ruling of the three-man panel, chairman of the tribunal, Justice Bello Tukur, struck out the petitions and ordered the petitioners to pay the sum of N250,000 as cost to the defendantsâ€™ counsel. Daily Trust learnt that with that ruling, the governorship election tribunal had concluded its assignment in Gombe.
