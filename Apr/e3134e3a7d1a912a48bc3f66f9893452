The Aldo of Kujama in Kajuru Local Government Area of Kaduna state Alhaji Idris Gunderi said more than  74,000 cattle were rustled across Kaduna State in four years. He said the owners of those cattle are left without compensation nor assistant from both state and Federal Government. The Fulani Leader who disclosed this w‎hile fielding question from news men in Kaduna  said he has the list of those affected. He said government must find a way to assist those whose cows were stolen as a way of providing succour to them. “Nothing was given to the Fulanis who owns those cattle not even a mudu of maize as government assistance. ” I have the list of these people whose cows were rustled with me. It’s unfortunate the kind of situation our people find themselves‎,” he said. He lamented that the number of cows rustled are continuing without any serious measures from authorities to curtail the situation. ‎The Aldo also blamed the government both at the federal and state levels on the failure to prosecute culprits arrested. He said Fulanis are left struggling to feed their family members because they lost all their animals to criminals, adding, “In fact presently our people prefer living in other parts of the country than in the northern region,” he said.
