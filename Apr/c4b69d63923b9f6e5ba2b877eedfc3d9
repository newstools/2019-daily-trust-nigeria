Some returning House of Representatives and members-elect from the North Central have urged the Presidency and leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to zone the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives to the geo-political zone. The Director General, Wase Equity Project 2019 (WEP 2019), and member representing Gboko/Tarka Federal Constituency Benue State, Dr John Dyegh, made the plea in Abuja at a news conference. The WEP 2019 is promoting the aspiration of a fourth-term member of the House, Hon. Ahmed Idris Wase, representing Wase Federal Constituency of Plateau State. Dyegh said Idris Wase deserved to occupy the exalted position of Speaker based on his legislative experience as the deputy leader in the outgoing 8th House and robust contribution to debate in the chamber. He said the North Central must be compensated for delivering the third largest votes to the second term election of President Muhammadu Buhari during the February 23 presidential election, coming behind the North West and the North East in that order. He said, “Because if you look at it critically, the North West has Mr President, the South West has the vice President; the Senate President has been zoned to the North East. We think that if the South West that contributed the fourth largest votes, it already has the vice president. “We believe the North Central deserves the position of Speaker and Hon Ahmed Idris Wase rightly fits in going by his antecedents in the House and his wide acceptance by all,” Dyegh said.
