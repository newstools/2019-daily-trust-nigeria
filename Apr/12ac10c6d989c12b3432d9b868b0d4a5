The Governor of Oyo State, Abiola Ajimobi, has inaugurated a 27-man committee saddled with the responsibility of ensuring a smooth handing over of power to Governor-elect, Mr. Seyi Makinde. The committee, comprising 17 from the government and 10 from the incoming administration, was inaugurated yesterday at the executive council chambers of the governorâ€™s office in Ibadan. Part of the terms of reference of the committee is to evolve a seamless framework for the change of baton, as well as to organise a befitting handing over ceremony. In his address at the occasion, Ajimobi admonished the committee members to place the interest of the state and its citizens above other narrow interests by emulating the existing cordiality between him and Makinde. Gov. Ajimobi emphasised that the event should not be seen as a mere stunt targeted at making history, but should be regarded as a deliberate step to promote the tenets of politics without bitterness.
