The Kebbi State Commissioner of Basic and Secondary Education, Mohammad Magawata, has said 2,000 teachers have been recruited in the state to meet up with deficiency of teachers across schools in the state. Magawata who disclosed this to journalists in an interview in Kebbi after a two-day media training on Cash Transfer Programme (CTP) organised by United Nations Children Education Fund (UNICEF), said education is striving well in the state as Governor Abubakar Bagudu has given premium to the sector. He said in the last two months the recruitment of teachers has been ongoing. “I went to all the headquarters and we have finished the recruitment of 2000 teachers. We will start giving them offer soon,” said. Speaking on the challenges of the recruitment he said most university graduates are not qualified to teach. “There was a time I brought a graduate here; he could not define economics. We have to sit down with our local colleagues at the university. In fact, in Argungu we had to call the official to sit down at the interview place to see what we are seeing,” he said.
