The Supreme Court has upheld the nomination of Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State as the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, during the 2018 guber poll in the state. The court, in a unanimous judgment of a five-man panel, held on Wednesday that the appeal by Segun Oni, was statute barred. Justice Amiru Sanusi, in the lead judgment, held that the case, being a pre-election one, was not commenced at the trial court, within the required time, as stipulated under the Fourth Alteration Act. Oni, an ex-Governor of Ekiti State had appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which upheld the decision of a Federal High Court, to the effect that his (Oni’s) challenge of Fayemi’s eligibility to contest the last governorship election in the state, was without merit. Court of Appeal affirms Fayemi’s election Ekiti: Oni fails to unseat  Fayemi at  S/Court Ekiti: Tribunal sacks Oni,  declares Fayemi governor
