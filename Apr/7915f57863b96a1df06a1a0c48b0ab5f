The Commandant General of Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC, Abdullahi Gana Muhammadu has assured Nigerians of a hitch-free and peaceful Easter celebration.  Emmanuel Okeh, the Corps’ spokesman said in a statement that Gana gave the assurance at the Corps National Headquarters, Abuja after charging all state commands to ensure massive deployment of personnel to all the nooks and crannies of the country, especially churches, market places, shopping malls, play grounds and all the places perceived to be soft targets of attack.  According to him, Gana warned those who saw festive periods as times  to carry out their nefarious activities to desist and stay away from trouble as extra deployment of personnel had been made, stressing that whoever is caught, will face the wrath of the law.  He admonished the Corps to work in synergy with other sister agencies and to be diplomatic and law abiding when dealing with the populace.  While celebrating the period with Christians, Gana charged them to be Christ-like in all their activities by tolerating one another and preaching the gospel of peace and love.
