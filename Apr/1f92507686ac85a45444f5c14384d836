Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó has renewed his calls for anti-government protests, shortly after he was stripped of parliamentary immunity. “They think that by attacking us they can put an end to hope, but… they won’t stop us, we will give all for Venezuela” he tweeted. With his immunity from prosecution lifted, Mr Guaidó could face arrest. He has been at loggerheads with the government ever since he declared himself acting president on 23 January. Mr Guaidó, who leads the opposition-controlled legislature, the National Assembly, argues that President Nicolás Maduro is a “usurper” because he was re-elected in polls that have been widely disputed. Citing articles in the constitution which state that if the presidency is “vacant”, the head of the National Assembly should take over power temporarily, Mr Guaidó declared himself acting president.
