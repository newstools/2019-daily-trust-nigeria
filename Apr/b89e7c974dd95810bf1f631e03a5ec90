The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) has said the agency would not have mercy on manufacturers of fake and counterfeit products because the illegal act hurts the country’s economy. The Director-General of SON, Osita Aboloma, disclosed this during Stakeholders’ Sensitization Workshop on SON Act, 2015, held in Abuja. The SON boss warned manufacturers and exporters that the Organisation could seize and detain products for 90 days after being satisfied that the quality, purity or potency of such products are detrimental or hazardous to life. Aboloma, represented by SON’S Regional Coordinator for North Central, Charles Nwagbara, said in the last two years, the Organisation has instituted 14 cases in different courts in Kano, Awka, Lagos and some other states for various infractions related to abuse of standards. The SON boss said, “The days of reckless infractions in the various activities of the agency by manufacturers, importers and other operators are over.” He said the country is dealing with serious issues concerning safety of lives and property and that sub-standard products pose grave dangers not only to lives and property but to economic development of Nigeria. He said adhering to standard and quality products increase in exports and foreign earnings boost employment generation and job creation.
