The trial of a 30-year-old mother of two children, Ndifreke Femi, who allegedly stabbed her neighbour, Ayomide Ayenuwa, to death, has commenced before Justice Mobolanle Okikiolu-Ighile sitting at the Lagos High Court, Igbosere. Ayenuwa, a 28-year-old part time student, was stabbed to death at Femi’s Block 109, Ikota Housing Estate residence, Ajah, Lagos, on April 1, 2016. The first prosecution witness in the case, Esther Jeje, who described the deceased as her uncle, narrated to the court on Wednesday how Ayenuwa met his death when he went to Femi’s apartment next-door to iron out an issue on his monthly electricity bill. According to Jeje, her uncle met Mr and Mrs Femi embroiled in a domestic scuffle, and as he was making an effort to reconcile the couple, the defendant rushed into the kitchen, brought out a knife and stabbed him in the neck. “Ayenuwa made efforts to settle the quarrelling couple but they kept fighting each other so he decided to leave them to their troubles. As he was walking away, Ndifreke brought out a knife which she used to stab him on his neck from behind,” the witness said. Despite frantic efforts by other neighbours to save Ayenuwa’s life, Jeje added, he died on the way to the General Hospital, where he had been referred to, from loss of too much blood. During cross examination, however, Jeje agreed that she was not at the scene but was only told what happened by her neighbours. Further hearing has been fixed for April 17, 2019.
