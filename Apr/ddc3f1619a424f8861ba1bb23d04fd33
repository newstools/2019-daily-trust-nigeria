A coalition, All Progressives Congress (APC) Women Forum, formed by women who contested in the primaries in 2019 but lost out, has called on the Buhari administration to give them appointive positions that will enhance gender parity in governance. National Coordinator of the group, Mrs. Adedoyin E. Eshanomi, who addressed a press conference in Abuja, said about 306 of them, after obtaining forms for the primaries in the March, 2019 primaries, were muscled out due to gender and other irregularities. While congratulating President Muhammadu Buhari and Prof. Yemi Osinbajo on their well-deserved victory at the just concluded polls, the APC women aspirants said they were major stakeholders in the victory as they had worked round the clock to ensure party’s victory. The women said they were bullied out and intimidated during the primary elections despite their grassroots base, solid structure and popularity, thereby decreasing the number of women in the various elective positions and creating a huge gender imbalance in governance. They, therefore, implored the president to entrust them with challenging appointments, specifically 35 per cent of cabinet members, and 35 to 50 per cent of board appointments. This, they said “would give us opportunity to contribute our quota to nation building and also get us all prepared for 2023.” The group said women were bridge builders, peace-loving, hardworking, sincere, committed and above all honest and would support and ensure the actualisation of the government’s dream of a better Nigeria. 2019: Ebonyi APC to give women free nomination forms Pro-Oshiomhole protesters accuse APC governors of working against Buhari APC primaries: Female aspirant appeals to Buhari
