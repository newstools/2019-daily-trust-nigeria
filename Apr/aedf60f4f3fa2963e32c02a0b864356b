The embattled Chairman of Plateau State chapter of the PDP, Damishi Sango, has described his suspension and that of his deputy, Amos Gombi Goyol, by 16 members of the party’s executive as illegal. Sango and Goyol were both suspended on Wednesday over alleged diversion of presidential campaign funds during the 2019 general elections, as well as N9.8m meant for IPDs, among other issues. Sango, in a statement jointly signed by the party’s secretary, Mr. Emmanuel Tuang, said his suspension could not stand as it ran contrary to the party’s constitution. He also denied any wrong doing of misappropriating funds. “Their claim that they took the action to save the party does not hold water because we see their action as a morbid attempt to divide the party and cause disaffection and confusion. “On the resources sent to the state for the presidential elections, we state that this matter was appropriately reported to the state campaign council. The template was also discussed and approved by the campaign council. It was not to be reported to the party since it was the party that constituted the council. “In addition, the funds were not signed for and collected by the party chairman and/or his deputy as alleged. Rather, the funds were rightly signed for and collected by a team led by the gubernatorial candidate, and this was disclosed in full to the state campaign council,” the statement partly read. “We have come across very reliable information that the action of the 16 is being sponsored by a third force to cripple the very promising petitions at the elections tribunal. And we want to state here in clear terms that this action will fail woefully,” the statement added.
