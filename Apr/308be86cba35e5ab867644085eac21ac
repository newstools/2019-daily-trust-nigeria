The Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) disclosed yesterday that it would soon commence the replacement of Very High Frequency (VHF) radio equipment in eight locations across the country. This is part of the efforts to boost communication between pilots and air traffic controllers for safer air navigation. Spokesman of NAMA, Khalid Emele disclosed in a statement yesterday that the agency had put in place a machinery to accelerate an ongoing programme geared towards the total upgrade of its radio communication infrastructure across the country. The agency, according to the statement, has taken delivery of the VHF radio equipment under the “Extended Range VHF Coverage” project. He said the agency plans to replace all the Very High Frequency (VHF) radios at the existing eight remote sites in Lagos, Kano, Wukari, Sokoto, Ilorin, Port Harcourt, Abuja and Maiduguri. According to him, to spread the VHF locations across the country, it would add six (6) new sites in Jos, Kaduna, Yola, Enugu, Benin and Calabar to make a total of 14 VHF sites in Nigeria. “This is to ensure that communication challenges experienced by pilots in some parts of the airspace are totally eliminated,” he said. Emele said the VHF remote sites are operated in a network which will have signal pattern that covers the entire Nigerian airspace.
