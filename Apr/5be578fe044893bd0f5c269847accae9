The Seaport Terminal Operators Association of Nigeria (STOAN) has said all concessioned port terminals in the country are in full compliance with the provisions of the International Ships and Ports Facility Security (ISPS) Code. The ISPS Code, which is being implemented under the auspices of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), is an amendment to the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention (1974/1988) on minimum security arrangements for ships, ports and government agencies. The ISPS Code, which came into force in 2004, prescribes responsibilities to governments, shipping companies, shipboard personnel, and port/facility personnel to detect security threats and take preventative measures against security incidents affecting ships or port facilities used in international trade. STOAN spokesman, Mr. Bolaji Akinola, said in a statement that private terminal operators under the auspices of the association have made significant investment in ensuring adequate security measures in their operational areas in full compliance with the ISPS Code. Akinola said, “The ISPS Code is an essential maritime regulation for the safety and security of ships, ports, cargo and crew. For this reason, all private terminal operators at the six major port complexes across the country do not take the responsibilities of ensuring adequate compliance to the provisions of the code lightly.’’ NIMASA stops ship loading over security concerns US backs NIMASA on  port security reforms NIMASA: Non-compliant jetties, port operators to lose certificates
