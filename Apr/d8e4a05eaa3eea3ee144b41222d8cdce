The newly elected President of the Miners Association of Nigeria (MAN), Alhaji Muhammed Kankara, has said the mining sector is next to the oil sector in terms of revenue generation. Alhaji Kankara said this after his election as MAN president yesterday in Abuja. “The mining sector is next to the oil sector. It has been left sleeping for decades, and it is high time we appreciate what God has given to us in the soil. And we are there to bring it out so that government can benefit and increase the GDP of this country. We will increase employment in this country and we will increase the earnings of the miners and the government as we come on board,” he said. Kankara said he would take the association to the level were miners were proud of and the government was able to generate enough revenue from the sector.
