The Vice-Chancellor of the Federal University (FUOYE), Oye-Ekiti, Professor Kayode Soremekun, has warned new students of the institution to stay away from cultism, drugs, examination malpractices and other social vices or be expelled from the university. Soremekun, who gave the warning yesterday during the matriculation of the 2018/2019 academic session, stressed that FUOYE had zero tolerance for anti-social behaviours. The Vice Chancellor urged the students to take advantage of the good number of academic teachers in the university to harness their potentials. He added, “I am challenging you to soar like eagles. We have in this university well-placed teachers available for you to harness your potentials. I want to see all of you here in the next four-five years for the second leg of your journey. “To achieve this goal, you must be diligent and stay away from examination malpractices, cultism, drugs and other anti-social behaviours.” He said the university would focus on the infrastructural development of its Ikole-Ekiti campus, while quickly clarifying this did not mean the main campus would be abandoned. The university matriculated students from 11 faculties for 49 programmes.  ZARIA: ABU matriculates 13,000 VC advises students to shun drug abuse Al-Hikmah varsity, COE matriculate 5,060 students
