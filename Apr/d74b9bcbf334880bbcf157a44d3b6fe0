The senator representing Benue Northwest Senatorial District, George Akume, has said that conviction to regain his lost victory at the just concluded general elections in the state had been re-enforced. Akume, who sought for a fourth term in the Senate under the APC, alongside other APC federal lawmakers in the state, lost his bid to secure the seat. “We may have made mistakes only to gain more experience for the task ahead now that we have re-enforced stronger conviction towards regaining our victory, for evil cannot triumph over truth and justice,” he said. Akume, leader of APC in the state, made the remark while commissioning constituency projects for the use of members of his district at Ikpayongo in Gwer East Local Government Area (LGA) at the weekend.
