The Emir of Machina, Alhaji Bashir Albishir Bukar Machinama, has conferred the title of the Shettima Mafatihuma of Machina on Yobe State Governor Ibrahim Gaidam in appreciation of his efforts in citing various developmental projects in the area which have “opened Machina to the world.” The emir announced the conferment of the title on the governor yesterday in Machina town in a ceremony marking the close of the week-long Machina Annual Cultural Festival (MACUF). He said it was the judgment of the Machina Emirate Council that the 10-year tenure of Gaidam as the state’s governor had been “the most blessed and the most significant event” in the history of the state. The emir, who described the governor as a visionary, said  he will be turbaned with his new title at a time to be announced later. While accepting the title and the honour done him, Gaidam expressed his gratitude for the warm reception that the emirate council and the people of Machina had given him and his entourage.
