Imo state governor, Rochas Okorocha, has said the South East geo-political zone must be given the chance to produce either the Senate President or deputy Senate President for geo-political balancing and equal distribution of positions. Okorocha spoke to journalists after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House in Abuja on Monday. “I’ve been watching carefully what is happening in the National Assembly, it’s a very funny drama. But all I ask from them is that they should consider the South East in their calculations. This nation will not be properly balanced if South East is not carried along properly in the affairs of the National Assembly. “Nobody seems to be talking about the South East, it looks like the South East doesn’t have a place anymore; that is wrong, politically speaking and that is not good for APC. Because there is going to be a bigger APC after President Muhammadu Buhari must have left the seat. “They shouldn’t think about giving South East, whatever position for giving sake. You can’t just wake up and give them any position. South East is a key primary zone in this country and if we don’t get the number one seat, we should get the number two seat,” he said. He said he was in the State House to invite President Buhari for the commissioning of over 1,000 projects he has executed in Imo state. He said he did not discuss the issue of his certificate of return with the president.
