The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and its exploration and production subsidiary, Nigerian Petroleum Development Company Limited (NPDC), are set to unveil the largest Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and Propane storage and dispensing facility in Oredo, Benin City, Edo state The facility, which is an extension of the Integrated Gas Handling Facility (IGHF) plant, has the capacity to dispense 330 tonnes of LPG and 300 tonnes of Propane daily, in addition to the 100 million standard cubic feet of gas per day (MMscfg/d) and 260 barrels per day condensate from the IGHF plant. A statement by NNPC’s spokesman, Mr. Ndu Ughamadu, quoted the Managing Director of NPDC, Mr. Yusuf Matashi, to have said the IGHF would be a game changer for the corporation, as both facilities (IGHF and LPG bay) when commissioned, would be a huge revenue stream for the Federal Government. He stated that before the end of 2019, NPDC would be producing 40 per cent of the nation’s LPG requirements, adding that the facility was centrally positioned to supply LPG to Lagos, South South, South East and to the North in order to grow its consumption across the country. Mr. Matashi noted that currently, NPDC was the single largest supplier of gas to the domestic market with about 90 per cent of gas supply targeted at power generation to drive the nation’s economy positively.
