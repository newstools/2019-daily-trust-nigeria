A Federal High Court sitting in Katsina has sacked the Member representing Bakori/ Danja in the House of Representatives, Amiru Tukur Idris. Hon. Idris who had been in the House of Representatives had sought for another mandate but was defeated during the primary election of the APC. His name was, however, reportedly submitted to INEC as candidate of the party in the last elections, prompting his challenger, Engr. Yakubu Nuhu Danja, to approach the court for redress. Delivering judgement, Justice Hadiza Shagari said all the seven reliefs sought by the applicant, Engr. Danja, had been granted. She said the substitution of the plaintiff’s name (Yakubu Danja) with that of the second defendant (Amiru Tukur) as candidate in the Federal House of Representatives election was null, unlawful and of no effect. “The reliefs sought by the plaintiff are hereby granted and the originating summons succeed,” she added. At the primary, Yakubu polled 314 votes to defeat Tukur Idris who scored 305 votes.
