Pope Francis will carry out the traditional pre-Easter ritual of the washing of the feet in a prison near Rome, the Vatican said on Wednesday. “The ritual recalls the gesture that Jesus is believed to have performed on his knees for the 12 apostles before the Last Supper, to show them that the Lord was capable of the most humble act. “The pontiff will perform it on April 18, Holy Thursday, in the prison of Velletri, some 45 kilometres South-East of Rome,’’ a Vatican statement said. Francis has made it a habit of celebrating the ritual outside of traditional church settings, to reach out to people in difficult situations. In previous Holy Thursdays, the pope visited other prisons, including one for juvenile criminals, a centre for the disabled, and a migrant detention camp.
