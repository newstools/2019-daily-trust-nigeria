The Lagos Water Corporation yesterday explained that the disruption being experienced in some parts of the state was due to ongoing road construction. The affected areas where residents had complained of water supply disruption are Iyana-Ipaja, Egbeda, Dopemu, Orile-Agege, Idimu, Isheri-Olofin and other adjoining communities. The Managing Director/CEO of the corporation, Engineer Muminu Badmus, said the construction work caused a heavy burst on  LWC’s 1200mm ductile pipe along the Lagos-Abeokuta expressway part of Lagos State. Badmus, in a statement by the Public Relations Officer of the corporation, Anifowoshe Rasaq, explained that the ongoing road construction at Iyana-Ipaja bus-stop had damaged the water mains/pipe supplying potable water to these areas, thereby affecting water supply. He apologized to the residents of the affected areas over the  disruption, especially at this Easter period. He assured that the Corporation’s engineers were working hard to restore normal supply.
