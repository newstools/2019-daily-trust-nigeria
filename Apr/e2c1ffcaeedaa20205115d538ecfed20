— To issue 30-year bond June 2019 Nigeria’s total debt as at December 31, 2018 stood at N24.4 trillion ($79.437 billion), representing a year on year growth of 12.25 percent, the Debt Management Office (DMO) has revealed. DMO also revealed that Nigeria will issue its first 30-year naira bond in the second quarter of 2019 to attract long-term investors and extend the maturity profile of its debt. While presenting the public debt data on Thursday in Abuja, Director General of DMO, Ms Patience Oniha, stressed that the Federal Government’s domestic debt stock includes N331.12 billion promissory notes issued to oil marketing companies and state governments in December 2018. She said the share of the domestic stock dropped to 68.18 percent from 73.36 percent as at December 31, 2017 thereby achieving a mix of 68.18 percent and 31.82 percent ratio of domestic and external debt stock. The National Assembly is expected to approve the total borrowing for 2019 which was put at N1.649 trillion. She said the strategy of using relatively cheaper and longer tenored eternal funds was achieving the expected objectives, including creating more space for other borrowers in the domestic market, extending the average tenor of the debt stock in order to reduce refinancing risk and increase external reserves. Oniha said the implementation of the strategy led to an injection of N855 billion through the redemption of Nigerian Treasury Bills in 2018 and also a drop in the government’s borrowing rate in the domestic market from over 18 percent in 2017 to 18 percent in 2018. The new 30-year Federal Government bond, according to Oniha, will attract long-term investors and contribute to the development of the domestic capital market and reduce the refinancing risk of government. She also said the issuance of the bond would meet the needs of annuity funds and the area of focus will be the management of risks associated with the debt stock to mitigate debt service costs. The funds raised would create jobs and build infrastructure, a debt office presentation said on Thursday, adding that the debt would be raised via Federal Government bonds, Islamic Sukuk and green bonds to fund projects to reduce carbon emissions.
