Algeria will hold its presidential election on July 4, the interim presidency on Wednesday said after weeks of mass protests led to the resignation of long-serving leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika.  o further details were immediately given. On Tuesday, Interim President Abdelkader Bensalah had said he would organise free elections within 90 days.  Earlier on Wednesday, Algeria’s army chief said he expected to see members of the ruling elite in the major oil and natural gas-producing country prosecuted for corruption and that he would support a transition toward elections.  Lt.-Gen. Gaid Salah’s comments were the strongest hint yet that the military would play its traditional role as kingmaker after the ailing 82-year-old Bouteflika bowed to popular pressure and quit on April 2 after 20 years in power. “The army will meet the people’s demands,” said Salah, addressing officers and soldiers at a military base. “The judiciary has recovered its prerogative and can work freely.” (NAN) Fall of Abdelaziz Bouteflika Algeria: President Bouteflika drops fifth term bid ALGERIA: Army wants President Bouteflika removed
