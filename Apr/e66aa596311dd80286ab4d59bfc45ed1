The Senator-elect for Kaduna Central Senatorial Zone, Malam Uba Sani has described himself as a product of the late human right activist, Chief Gani Fawehinmi’s mentoring.  Sani who made the remarks to mark the 81st post-humous birthday of the late legal luminary, said though Fawehinmi is gone, he still lives in the hearts of Nigerians as he has left legacies that continue to make positive impact on the lives of Nigerians and the nation’s justice administration system.  He said, “Having touched lives too numerous to mention, the late legal and human rights icon had etched his name in gold in the struggle for Nigeria’s democracy. He mentored many who are today holding aloft the torch of human rights and democracy in Nigeria.”  Uba Sani said he benefitted from Fawehinmi’s fountain of wisdom and unquantifiable knowledge.
