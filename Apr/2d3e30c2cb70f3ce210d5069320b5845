ExxonMobil, said it has earmarked N170 million in oil communities in Akwa Ibom State for peace building programmes and enhance its smooth operation and development of host communities. The General Manager, Public and Government Affairs, ExxonMobil, Mr. Nigel Cookey-Gam, said the programme was one of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) and Mobil Producing Nigeria (MPN) joint venture initiatives dedicated to engaging the youths positively on the virtue of peaceful engagement. Speaking in Eket, at the formal flag off of the programme tagged “Community Investment Programme (CIP)”, Cookey-Gam said the programme was targeting the youths of its host communities of Eket, Esit Eket, Ibeno and Onna local government areas. “The NNPC/MPN Joint Venture is here for the long haul and is repositioning to deliver greater value to the community, Akwa Ibom State and Nigeria,” Cookey-Gam said. The State Commissioner for Transport and Petroleum Resources, Mr Orman Esin, who flagged off the programme urged ExxonMobil to increase its budgetary allocation to the community investment programme in the state. He said the N170 million meant for the peace and capacity building programme for the youths was grossly inadequate, given the priceless value of peace and industrial harmony in oil bearing communities. Esin called on the multi-national oil company to make the community investment programme a yearly programme, adding that the youths were in dire need of job opportunities and capacity development. He advised the youths to remain peaceful and allow the company to operate, promising that he would engage the company until the demands of the communities are met.
