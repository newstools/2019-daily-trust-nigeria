The president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), Razak Jaiyeola, has charged members of the institute to be technologically informed and put it into use. Speaking in Lagos at the opening ceremony of the institute’s two-day technology summit yesterday, Jaiyeola said accountants were expected to be vast in the deployment of emerging technologies into their operations as accountants, both in private and public organizations. “As accountants, our roles are now beyond crunching financial figures with outmoded methods. We must be in the vanguard of creatively destroying existing models and develop new ones that would be both efficient and effective for the prompt discharge of our responsibilities to clients. We must constantly update our knowledge, skills and competencies in these emerging disruptive technologies. This is what would safeguard our continued relevance in the highly competitive global and digitally-driven market,” he said. He stated that the summit is part of ICAN’s interventions at making chartered accountants and other professionals future-ready because failure to keep pace with the disruptive technological trend portends danger of extinction for any business entity or individual.
