The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has said it would engage in constant training and capacity building for anti-corruption officials to appreciate, understand and cope with the changing and emerging trends of corruption and corrupt practices in the region. Speaking at the Network of Anti-Corruption Institutions in West Africa’s (NACIWA) meeting on developing faculties for Training on Corruption Risk Assessment (CRA) in Abuja yesterday, the Director, Political Affairs, ECOWAS Dr Remi Ajibewa said, their experience of supporting the fight against corruption in the region has also predicted the need to direct their efforts not only on enforcement but also and more essentially on preventive measures in combatting corruption. Dr Ajibewa said,  ECOWAS has strategically chosen Anti-corruption institutions, the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC) to serve as coordinating pillar of the conduct of corruption risks assessment in Member States.
