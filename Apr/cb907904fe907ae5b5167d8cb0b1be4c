Flags were flown at half mast at the orientation camp of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in Sokoto following the death of a corp member last Sunday. The corp member, Ihe  Fortune Ihiechie, an indigene of IMO State who was fondly called “Biggy” by his fellow colleagues died around 11:30pm while being taken to Usmanu Danfodio University Teaching Hospital for treatment. Daily Trust learnt that Biggy had complained of body pain and was managed at the camp’s clinic after which he went back to the hostel. He was however, taken back by his colleagues after noting  that he was gasping. He was then taken in an ambulance to the hospital but died along the way. Some of his colleagues who spoke to Daily Trust described him as jovial, vibrant and very active. The state Coordinator of NYSC, Mr Philip Enaberue said the entire camp was in a sombre mood following the death. Enberue however, denied that the deceased died as a result of their negligence, saying they had done all they could do to save him but to no avail. He said the deceased was a graduate of Gregory University, Uturu, where he read economics and was an active participant in the camp activities. “He was very a vibrant and active participant in our activities at the camp this was why he was so popular among his colleagues,” the Coordinator said. He added that ” Biggy had applied for relocation to Cross Rivers State on health ground which was graciously approved and was planning to take a flight after closing the camp on Tuesday but for his untimely death.
