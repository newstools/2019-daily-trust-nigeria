Zenith Bank has announced automatic employment for best graduating students of some departments at Veristas University, Abuja as it pledged to donate 20 laptops to the Computer Studies department. Deputy Managing Director of the bank, Dr. Adaora Umeoji announced this last weekend while delivering a Convocation Lecture with the theme: “Softening the Skills of university Graduates for Competitiveness and Excellence.” She said products of Nigerian universities can position themselves in terms of global competitiveness and excellence if they move beyond academic and practical knowledge to learn softening skills. “Drawing from my experience in the private sector, I can attest that graduates from Nigerian universities are very intelligent, hardworking and determined to succeed,” she said. She further said “When you take a roll call of outstanding Nigerians in both public and private sector who have made Nigeria proud, you will discover that they all went through Nigerian universities.” There is nothing fundamentally wrong with graduates from Nigerian universities rather, for graduates to be competitive and excel in their chosen careers, they will need to explore soft skills to complement the technical skills acquired during their university training She pointed that graduates and researchers from Nigerian universities can fix Nigeria’s problem and place it on global stage if they deploy creativity and innovation, saying, Nigeria’s redemption will come from within. ‘Private universities provide quality education’ Why Nigerians flock to Ghanaian schools Our graduates are ready for workplace – Nile VC
