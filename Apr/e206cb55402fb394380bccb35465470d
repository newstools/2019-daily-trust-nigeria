The Department of Political Science and International Relations, University of Abuja, has sensitised students on the evils of corruption and the need to stamp it out in governance. Speaking at the quarterly forum of the department at the weekend, the Vice Chancellor of the University, Prof. Michael Adikwu, who was represented by the Director of Development, Prof. S.P. Ejaro, said the corruption crusade for the students of the university was apt. He said, “This forum is coming at a critical phase in our nation’s history. Corruption is a major issue in Nigeria. The current APC government has made the fight against corruption a major agenda of the administration since 2015”. Prof. Adikwu said his administration would support the forum and commended it for the initiative. In an interview with newsmen, the Head of Department of Political Science and International Relations of the university, Prof. James Nda Jacob, said the forum organised the corruption crusade to inculcate moral values in the students who would become future leaders. Prof. Jacob called on political office holders to always provide purposeful leadership capable of satisfying the aspirations of the citizens, and advised them to shun corrupt practices. Delivering the forum’s lecture tagged: “Corruption and The Future of Nigeria”, the Founding Executive Director in charge of African Centre for Leadership, Strategy and Development (CLSD), Dr. Otive Igbuzor, noted that President Buhari had already set the tone at the top  for combating corruption in the country. Dr. Igbuzor appealed to Nigerians to join hands with the government to fight corruption in all ramifications for the betterment of the society.
