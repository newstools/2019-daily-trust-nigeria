The House of Representatives’ member-elect for Darazo/Ganjuwa Federal Constituency of Bauchi State, Mansur Manu Soro, says Femi Gbajabiamila is the choice of the majority of members-elect for the position of Speaker in the incoming 9th National Assembly. Soro, who said this while speaking to journalists on the speakership race, added that Gbajabiamila was best suited for the position because of his legislative experience and loyalty to the APC. He said his choice would ensure the independence of the legislature and harmonious relation with the executive and judicial arms of government. “Gbajabiamila is committed to lead the house to provide best-in-class solutions to critical issues affecting our country and to drive a solid plan of action for the achievement of both quick wins and longer term objectives of the 9th assembly,” he said. The newly elected lawmakers said majority of the new members coming to the House of Representatives were keen observers of what happened in the 8th assembly which slowed the implementation of various Federal Government’s projects and policies. “We want to have people that will ensure smooth and timely passage of budgets, executive and other bills that will ensure better life for Nigerians. That is what our constituencies elected us to do.  So, we must put Nigeria first in all what we are going to do,” he said.
