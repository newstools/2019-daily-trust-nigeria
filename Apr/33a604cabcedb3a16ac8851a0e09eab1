Twenty-five people were killed in western Bolivia when the bus they were travelling in fell more than 200m down a ravine. The bus was trying to overtake a lorry when it collided head-on with another vehicle and went over the cliff, injuring 24 passengers. Speed could have contributed to the crash on Sunday night local time. The bus, which was operated by a company called Totai, was travelling from the countryâ€™s administrative capital, La Paz, to the Amazon town of Rurrenabaque.
