Thousands of demonstrators are spending a second night camped outside Sudanâ€™s army headquarters, demanding that President Omar al-Bashir step down. They appear to be hoping for an internal coup, pleading with the army command to remove Mr Bashir and open the way for a transitional government. It is the biggest protest against Mr Bashir since unrest began in December. Mr Bashir has refused to leave, saying opponents should seek power through elections. The army has not intervened. Security forces have fired tear gas to try to disperse protesters outside the army compound in the capital, Khartoum. The latest rallies mark the 34th anniversary of the coup that overthrew the regime of former President Jaafar Nimeiri.
