A coalition of 160 women groups has requested that the position of Speaker of the House of Representatives and Deputy Senate President of the 9th National Assembly be given to women. This was contained in a letter written to the National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole, which was jointly signed by leaders of the groups under the auspices of a campaign platform called “More Women”. The coordinators of the groups said Hon. Nkeiruka Onyejeocha and Sen. Oluremi Tinubu should be supported for the position of house speaker and deputy senate president respectively. “More Women Campaign is concerned with the continued marginalisation of women in leadership positions in the country and committed to ensuring that women are in decision making positions in line with Nigeria’s international commitment on gender equality,” they said. It was signed by Dr. Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi, Executive Director, Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre (WARDC), and the Chairperson, Transition Monitoring Group (TMG); Prof. Joy Ngozi Ezeilo, Executive Director, Women Aid Collectives (WACOL); Dr. Lydia Umar, Gender Awareness Trust (GAT); Prof Patricia Donli, Gender Equality, Peace and Development Centre (GEPADCE); and Mimido Achkpa, Women’s  Rights To  Education (WREP), among others.
