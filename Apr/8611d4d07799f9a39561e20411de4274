Two yet-to-be-identified persons were yesterday burnt to death in an inferno that happened at Onipepeye, along the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, Ibadan. The fire incident claimed two lives, while three cars were burnt to ashes. A witness, who identified himself simply as Abbey, told our correspondent that the tragedy occurred when a fuel tanker driver heading to Ibadan from the Lagos end was attempting to manoeuvre his way beyond a commercial Nissan Micra taxi but lost control of the wheels in the process and the tanker fell on its side. “It was the spill of fuel from the fallen fuel tanker that resulted in fire under the Onipepeye bridge, and before we could say anything, there was a big explosion. Everyone began scrambling to escape from the scene but two persons were so unlucky as the fire caught up with them. “These people were inside their cars trying to navigate their way to the main expressway. We did not recognise any of the victims. They have been burnt beyond recognition,” Abbey said. The Oyo State police command Public Relations Officer, Superintendent Olugbenga Fadeyi, confirmed the incident.
