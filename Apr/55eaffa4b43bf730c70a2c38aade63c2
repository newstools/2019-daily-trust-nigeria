The North West Coordinator of the All Progressives Congress (APC) new members of the House of Representatives, Architect Ibrahim Al-Mustapha Aliyu, yesterday, said they support the party’s endorsement of the incumbent House Leader, Mr. Femi Gbajabiamila, as speaker of the incoming 9th Assembly. “We toe to the party line; we have endorsed the choice of Femi Gbajabiamila as the speaker of the 9th Assembly,” he stated. According to him, the move was to uphold party supremacy, bolster democracy and ensure stability at the Green Chamber. “The forum aims to prevent the ugly development of the 8th Assembly, where the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had its way and railroaded persons with uncertain and unstable minds into positions of leadership,” said. Aliyu said this time around, every loyal party member must work in line with the expectations of the APC to ensure that the laudable policies and programmes of President Muhammadu Buhari sailed through in the general interests of Nigerians. Aliyu, who is representative-elect for Wurno/Rabah Federal Constituency, added that the forum was taking advantage of its numerical strength to have its way.
