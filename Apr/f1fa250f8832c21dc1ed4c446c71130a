Ahead of APGA’s elective national convention, the northern stakeholders of the party have demanded that the position of the national chairman be zoned to the North. The group further asked for equity in the distribution of other offices of the party in line with the Federal Character principle as stated in Article 18 of the party’s constitution. This was contained in a communique at the end of its meeting in Kaduna State at the weekend. The meeting had in attendance a former National Secretary of the party and governorship candidate of the party in Zamfara State, Alhaji Sani Abdullahi Shinkafi, Secretary of the party’s Board of Trustees (BoT), Mr. Polycarp Gankon, state chairmen and secretaries from the northern states and all other constitutionally recognised members of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party.
