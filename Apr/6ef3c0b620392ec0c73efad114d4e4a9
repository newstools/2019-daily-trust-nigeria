Two years after French presidential favourite Fran√ßois Fillon became caught up in a public funding scandal, investigating judges have recommended that he and his wife Penelope Fillon should go on trial. His campaign collapsed when allegations emerged that Mrs Fillon had been paid for years as a parliamentary assistant without having a pass.
