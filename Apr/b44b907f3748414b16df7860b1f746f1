Kwara State governor-elect AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has promised to run a government that will serve the best interest of the people. AbdulRazaq made the promise, yesterday, during the inauguration of the 80-member transition committee in Ilorin, the state capital. “The huge margin of our victory at the polls suggests that our people are fed up with the status quo and want a new approach to governance. We therefore have a historic duty to serve their best,” he said. AbdulRazaq urged the committee to discharge it duty in a way that would help the new government to serve the people. Chairman of the committee Aminu Adisa Logun said their job was to bridge the gap between the outgoing and the incoming government. Logun thanked the governor-elect for nominating them for the crucial assignment. Chairman of the APC in the state, Bashiru Bolarinwa, said the incoming government was already a departure from the past as conscious efforts were being made to carry everyone along. Meanwhile, some APC elders and youths in Oke-Ero Local Government Area of Kwara State have kicked against the 80-man transition committee named by the governor-elect.
