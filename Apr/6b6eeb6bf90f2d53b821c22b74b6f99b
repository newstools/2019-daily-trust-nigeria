The Oil Producers Trade Section (OPTS) of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), yesterday, decried the Federal Government’s pegging of gas price at $2.50 per million standard cubic feet (mscf), saying such regulated market falls short of the price required to attract investment for new gas developments. OPTS consists of key players in the nation’s exploration, development and production of Nigeria’s petroleum resources. In 2019, its 30 members operate approximately 90 per cent of Nigeria’s oil and gas production; either in partnership with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) or with other indigenous and international lease holders. Speaking in Lagos at the National Gas Association (NGA) 2019 Business Forum, its Chairman, Paul McGrath, said to date, Nigeria’s domestic gas prices were kept at a regulated low price which did not cover the cost required to fully develop its gas resources, emphasising that of the 162 trillion cubic feet reported gas reserves, about 75 per cent would require the building of new infrastructure to deliver gas resources to the domestic market. McGrath noted that the nation’s gas sector should transit into a liberalised market based on the “willing buyer, willing seller” principle and ensure the existence of a competitive fiscal regime to support upstream gas development. McGrath, who is also the Managing Director of ExxonMobil, lamented the weak commercial and financial structures of the gas-to-power commercial value chain with growing arrears and uncertainty in the payment system, stressing that such structures had dis-incentivised gas investors. Total Upstream’s Assistant General Manager, Gas, Mrs. Maryam Shehu, said with huge investments going into the gas sector annually, if there was no increase in the consumption, the nation might experience gas glut.
