Talks between the government and the Labour Party are continuing, as they try to break the Brexit deadlock. No 10 said ministers had contacted the opposition and “technical” discussions were taking place on Monday. Sources indicated the PM had not accepted Labour’s customs union demand, but there was a move towards changing the non-binding political declaration. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said there had been no change in the government’s “red lines”. The UK is currently due to leave the EU at 23:00 BST on Friday. So far, MPs have rejected the withdrawal agreement Theresa May reached with other European leaders last year. She is due to attend an emergency summit in Brussels on Wednesday, where EU leaders will expect to hear fresh plans aimed at ending the impasse in Parliament. Ahead of this, Mrs May will hold talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron in Berlin and Paris on Tuesday.
