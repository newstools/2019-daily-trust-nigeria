The Lagos Territorial Office of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) said it has mobilized seven chartered buses apart from providing food, water and accommodation to Libyan returnees on arrival in Lagos. The Coordinator, NEMA Lagos Territorial Office, Alhaji Idris Abubakar Mohammed, who stated this yesterday, said his office has been in the forefront of catering for Nigerian returnees from Libya which are being repatriated in droves. Our correspondent reports that no fewer than 12,974 have been repatriated in the last two years through the Joint efforts of the European Union and International Organization for Migration (IOM). More are still being expected in the weeks to come. NEMA has since been receiving returnees from the restive country alongside other agencies of the Federal Government. Speaking with our correspondent while receiving the latest set of returnees at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) in Lagos, the coordinator said after every reception exercise, NEMA with airport staff, carry out environmental cleanup. “The Lagos Territorial Office of the NEMA has consistently deployed its human and material assets to work with the IOM and other stakeholders for the success of this voluntary return initiative graciously funded by the EU,” he said. Mohammed said the office deploys the Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) ambulances; the Rapid Intervention Vehicle (RIV) for standby emergency preparedness and lighting; the incident vehicle for rapid response. “In view of the sustained commitment by NEMA on this initiative, we wish to request for the kind support of the EU and the IOM to complement our limited resources,” he said. 162 stranded Nigerians arrive from Libya 4 pregnant women, 158 Nigerians return from Libya "I've wasted one good year doing nothing in Libya"
