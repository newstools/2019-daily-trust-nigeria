The Member representing Tiev Constituency in the Benue State House of Assembly, Dominic Ucha, has advanced reasons why he should be considered for the position of speaker in the coming 9th Assembly. Ucha said he remained a committed party man from inception of his political career. The lawmaker, who also appealed to the conscience of the people of the state towards his ambition of becoming speaker, averred that this was the time to right whatever wrong that was done in 2015. He told Daily Trust in Makurdi that, “I trace my history and story from 2015 to this day and it has now culminated into a petition before the Benue people; a petition to their conscience and a petition for posterity to judge us. “Why did I say that? I remained in PDP, I have been in PDP all my life; we have carried the cross to this point. I have been a loyal party member and I have supported the government tremendously. So it is only natural and obvious that if things are done transparently in a way that even the old man in the village who felt that Rt. Hon. Ucha was short changed and is paid back; it will give people a lot of confidence that democracy is coming back as government of the people, for the people and by the people,” he said. Ucha who is among 23 of PDP members that won elections out of the 30 available seats in the assembly, emphasised that the voice of reason be allowed to prevail in the election of the speaker.
