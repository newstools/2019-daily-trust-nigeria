Petrol stations across Portugal are running dry just days after tanker drivers began a nationwide strike over pay and conditions. The country declared an energy emergency on Tuesday, and drivers agreed to supply essential services including hospitals and airports. But widespread shortages have prompted queues at petrol stations across the country, while some have closed. Among their demands, the drivers are pressing for double the minimum wage. Before the agreement to supply essential services, airports reported that they were running low on fuel supplies, which could have delayed or cancelled flights. Tuesdayâ€™s agreement did not include any possible solution to the strike, officials said, and the union has only agreed to supply minimum quantities.
