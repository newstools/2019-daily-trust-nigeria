The Department of Petroleum Resources has sealed up six filling stations in Sokoto and Kebbi states for alleged over pricing and hoarding, just as 20 trucks of Petroleum Motor Spirit arrived Sokoto on Tuesday. The Comptroller of Sokoto Field Office, Muhammad Makera, disclosed this while patrolling filling stations around Sokoto’s metropolis today. He said that the sealed stations were found selling above the government approved price of N145 per litre while others were hoarding the commodity. Makera said that the erring marketers were fined N100,000 per pump. According to him, there was no cause for panic buying as there was enough supply for the state. “20 trucks were supplied to the state today (Tuesday) out of which 12 were meant for the state metropolis,” he said. The Comptroller assured the public that the department would not relent in its mandate of ensuring strict compliance to regulations by filling stations. However, our reporter observed that queues were disappearing in filling stations around the Sokoto metropolis as all the major filling stations are opened for business.
