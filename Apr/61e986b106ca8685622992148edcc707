Weekly trading on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) resumed yesterday on a negative note with the market capitalisation dropping below N11 trillion mark amid price loses by some blue chips. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the market capitalisation dipped by N171 billion or 1.54 per cent to close at N10.955 trillion from the N11.124 trillion achieved on Friday. Also, the All-Share Index, which opened at 29,616.38, shed 454.14 or 1.53 per cent to close at 29,162.24. Mr Ambrose Omordion, the Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Ltd., attributed the recent bearish tend to low liquidity and poor investor confidence. Omordion said that ongoing volatility would continue as investors and fund managers rebalanced their portfolios with eyes on the political space and ongoing full year company earnings and post-election market dynamics. “With the price of major blue chips continuing to drop in recent weeks, we expect speculative trading to shape the market’s direction in this trading week despite the seeming negative outlook. “The volatility witnessed last week was driven by traders and investors repositioning ahead of dividend declarations by major listed companies,” he said. Omordion said that investors should review their positions in line with their investment goals, strength of companies’ numbers and act as events unfold in the global and domestic environment.
