A 40-year-old man, Idowu Abioye, who was at the weekend charged with defilement, has said that he only inserted his fingers into her daughter’s vagina to ascertain if her virginity was still intact. Abioye was dragged before a chief magistrate court, Ogba, Lagos, on a two-count charge of defilement and assault against his 20-year-old daughter. The police said that the accused, who resides at Cele 2, off the Aga area of Ikorodu, Lagos, was arrested after he was accused of inserting his fingers into his daughter’s private part. The prosecutor, Superintendent of Police Benson Emerhi,  who pleaded with the court to mete out stiff punishment on the accused to serve as deterrent to others, alleged that Abioye had cornered his daughter in a toilet where he met her cleaning up herself and asked her to spread her legs to enable him insert his fingers into her private part. “My Lord, the girl, who became confused as to what must have gotten into her father, reported the matter to her mother. The mother, who did not take it lightly, raised an alarm which attracted other neighbours. Before their neighbours, Idowu insisted that he was only playing with his daughter,” Emerhi said. The prosecutor said that the incident was reported to the police and the accused was arrested. Abioye pleaded not guilty. Supol Emerhi asked the court to give a date for trial to enable the police prove their case. Thus, the magistrate, Mrs O. Sule-Amzat, granted the accused bail in the sum of N200,000, with one surety in like sum. Sule-Amzat remanded the accused in prison custody pending when he would perfect his bail condition and adjourned the case till June 3, 2019.
