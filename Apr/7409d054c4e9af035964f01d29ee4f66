After nearly 30 years in power, Sudan’s President Omar al-Bashir has been ousted and arrested, the defence minister says. Speaking on state TV, Awad Ibn Ouf said the army had decided to oversee a two-year transitional period followed by elections. He also said a three-month state of emergency was being put in place. Protests against Mr Bashir, who has governed Sudan since 1989, have been under way for several months. The main group behind the demonstrations immediately rejected the military’s statement and urged people to remain at a sit-in outside army headquarters. Protesters want a civilian council to lead the transition rather than a military one. “I announce as minister of defence the toppling of the regime and detaining its chief in a secure place,” Mr Ibn Ouf said in a statement. Mr Bashir’s exact whereabouts are not known. As the news broke, crowds of protesters celebrated outside army headquarters in the capital, Khartoum, embracing soldiers and climbing on top of armoured vehicles. Sudan’s intelligence service said it was freeing all political prisoners. Mr Bashir is the subject of an international arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC), over alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Sudan’s western Darfur region.
