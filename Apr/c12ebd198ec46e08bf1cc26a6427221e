The APC candidate and governor-elect of Zamfara State, Alhaji Mukhtar Shehu Idris, has asked the Independent National Election Commission, (INEC) to release his certificate of return and those of the state House of Assembly members-elect. In a letter addressed to the Chairman of INEC, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, which was attached to a notice of appeal before the Supreme Court, Idris said having been declared winner of the March 9, 2019 governorship election in the state, it is imperative that the electoral umpire present to him his Certificate of Return. The electoral body had withheld the certificate of return of the governor-elect and other members-elect of the state’s House of Assembly, following the judgement of the Court of Appeal division in Sokoto State. However, Idris, through his lawyer, Mahmud Magaji (SAN), said, “It is worthy of note that the purported judgement of the Court of Appeal, has no any positive of direct order. But, assuming there is even a court order arising from the said judgement, we still have 21 days within which to appeal, thus, putting into abeyance the said judgement until after the elapse of the said 21 days. But, in the case at hand, the parties (APC Zamfara) still have 21 days existing side by side with their constitutional right of appeal. “Finally, we urge INEC to abide fully with the provision of Section 143 of the Electoral Act by releasing the certificate of return to Zamfara State governor-elect as well as all the state members-elect.’’  Zamfara governor-elect writes INEC, demands release of Certificate of Return INEC halts presentation of Certificates of Return to Zamfara Governor-elect, others INEC shelves issuance of certificate for Zamfara governor elect, assembly members
