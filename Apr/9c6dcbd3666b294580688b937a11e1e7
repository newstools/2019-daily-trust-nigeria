The House of Representatives Member-elect from Yobe State, Khadija Bukar Abba Ibrahim, has given reasons as to why she dropped her ambition of becoming the Speaker of the 9th House of Representatives. Mrs. Ibrahim, instead, said she would vie for the position of majority leader. The fourth-time legislator who will represent Damaturu, Tarmuwa, Gujba and Gulani, is the immediate past Minister of State for Foreign Affairs. Mrs. Ibrahim who spoke to journalists in Kaduna at the weekend, said she had all it took to be the speaker, but resolved to shelve her ambition in favour of APC’s preferred candidate, Femi Gbajabiamila. She also said she was in tune with the choice of Senate Leader, Ahmad Lawan, who is also from Yobe State, as the next senate president. “We had a dinner with the president and the Chairman of APC pronounced where the party is heading too, so, we as obedient party followers, have decided to go with the party,” she said. The lawmaker explained that she thus decided to vie for the post of majority leader. She, however, prayed that the male folk in the house would support her aspiration.
