The Supreme Court has received the records of appeal in the appeal challenging the judgement of the Court of Appeal, Sokoto Division, on the conduct of primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Zamfara State. The appeal before the apex court was filed by the governor-elect of the state, Alhaji Mukhtar Shehu Idris and 37 others, following the decision of the appellate court that there were irregularities in the conduct of the APC primaries in the state. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had relied on the decision to withhold issuance of certificates of return to the governor-elect and other members-elect of the State House of Assembly. It was gathered that though the apex court had received records of appeal, a date has however not been fixed for hearing the appeal. Earlier, in a letter addressed to the Chairman of INEC, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, which was attached to a notice of appeal before the Supreme Court, Idris said having been declared winner of the March 9, 2019 governorship election in the state, it is imperative that the electoral umpire presents to him his certificate of return. â€ŽSupreme Court receives records of appeal on Zamfara APC suit Appeal Court says Zamfara APC has no candidates Zamfara governor-elect writes INEC, demands release of Certificate of Return
