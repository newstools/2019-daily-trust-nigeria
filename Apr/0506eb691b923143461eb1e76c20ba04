Following the acquisition of 17,954 hectares of land from the Edo State Government for Palm oil cultivation, Dufil Prima Foods Plc, makers of Indomie Noodles have embarked on a crop compensation payment for 1,628 farmers across 14 communities in Ovia North-East Local Government Area of the state. The payment exercise, according to the Chief Operating Officer of Dufil Prima Foods Plc, Mr. Madhukar Khetan, commenced on Monday, April 8, 2019 and would last for three weeks. The exercise is being overseen by the Ministry of Agriculture. According to Khetan, the project would bring massive investment to the region, create job opportunities for indigenes of the state as well as help cut the importation of oil palm. He explained that the project marked a significant milestone in Dufil’s commitment to attaining a further backward integrated and self-sustaining system that supports the Nigerian economy. “In addition to the crop compensation to farmers, the next step after would be Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) as well as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) mandatory assessments and development of nursery,” he said.
