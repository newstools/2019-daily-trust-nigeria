The male youth wing of the Ahmadiyyah Muslim Ja’mat of Nigeria, otherwise known as Majlis Khuddam-ul-Ahmadiyya of Nigeria, has hosted its annual free health service for residents of Yaba Local Development Council Area in Lagos. The 2019 edition of the free healthcare service, held at the Alhaji Kola Osho Primary Health Centre, Yaba, witnessed the turnout of residents of different faiths who came to seek medical checks, doctors’ advice and free malaria drugs, among others. The Assistant Officer in charge of the Majlis Khuddam-ul-Ahmadiyya Physical Health, Dr. Ali Abdulazeez, said the gesture was in keeping faith with the directive of Allah and Prophet Muhammed to always extend corporate social responsibility to members of every community, especially in areas where they reside or work. “This is a two-day event, aiming at assisting members of the community. Last year, we were in Zaria, Kaduna State, and were impressed with the people’s turnout. As muslims, we are conscious of the responsibilities and directive of Allah and beyond calling people into the path of Allah, we are also interested in seeing to the improvement in their health and general well-being,” Abdulazeez said. Similarly, the group’s Secretary, Children section, Abdulhakeem Akintobi, said the youths were being motivated by the directive of Prophet Muhammed that says, “A strong muslim is better than a weak one.” Akintobi said the idea of providing the health service was to improve the people’s well-being and produce a better society. He said the drugs and other services being provided were not donations or sponsorships but ones that were secured through the personal efforts of members who were willing to do more to propagate Islam across every length and breadth of the country.
