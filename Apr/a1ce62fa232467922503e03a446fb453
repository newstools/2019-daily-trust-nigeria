Amidst calls for the adoption of open ballot system in the election of presiding officers of the 9th National Assembly, two Lawmakers say the lower chamber’s laid down rules could not be disregarded. Reps Rimamnde Shawulu (PDP-Taraba) and Kehinde Agboola (PDP-Ekiti) made the remarks on Sunday, in separate interviews with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja. NAN reports that some civil society organisations (CSOs) were among many proponents of the adoption of open ballot voting for the leadership of the 9th national assembly. According to Shawulu, any attempt to change the House of Representatives’ Standing Orders in the 9th assembly election without following the due process will be an aberration to the practice. The lawmaker, who got re-elected in the Feb. 23 National Assembly polls, said promoters of open ballot election were not well informed. “Let them come from outside and amend the rules now. President Muhammadu Buhari said he could not assent to the Electoral Act because it was too close to the 2019 general elections. “Now, we have some weeks to the election and you want to amend how leadership is elected. That is double standard; it doesn’t make sense,’’ Shawulu said. The lawmaker, who is the Chairman, House Committee on Army, however, said the rules would have to be amended at the lower chamber before anyone could talk about open ballot. “The rules are already set; any member, who wants the rules amended, can bring the motion to the floor of the house. “And if it is passed, it becomes law but now, the rules of the house have been there since 2011. “The same rules that led to the emergence of Aminu Tambuwal are the same rules that led to the emergence of Yakubu Dogara.
