The National Assembly members elected on the platform of the APC in Plateau State have thrown their weight behind the candidacy of Sen. Ahmad Lawan and Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila for senate president and speaker respectively. Daily Trust reports that three of the four members of the House of Representatives recently elected and two APC senators in Plateau State, yesterday, signed a document endorsing Lawal and Gbajabiamila despite the interest of one of their own, Hon. Ahmed Idris Maje, in the speakership. The APC won four of the eight House of Representatives seats in Plateau and two of the senate seats. However, in a statement signed by all the elected representatives except Maje, they stated that: “We have consented to work in tandem with the decision of the party at the national level and that of the North Central Governor’s Forum in the choice of the leadership of the two chambers of the 9th National Assembly when it is inaugurated in June 2019.” The statement which was signed by Senators-elect, Amb. Ignatius Longjan and Hezekiah Dimka, as well as Hon. Yusuf Adamu Gagdi, Hon. Alphonsus Komsol and Hon. Haruna Maitala, and made available to Daily Trust, had the members vowing never to work against the wish of the party which sponsored them. “Both Lawal and Gbajabiamila are credible personalities who as principal officers of the 8th National Assembly have proven their leadership prowess as majority leaders of the two chambers respectively,” the statement read in part. …Bago loses home support as Niger APC, others back Gbajabiamila, Lawan Group wants Lalong to support Maje’s ambition for speaker APC, PDP set to clash over  National Assembly leadership
