The former Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Attahiru Muhammadu Jega, has accused the academicians used as ad hoc staff during the 2019 elections for conniving with politicians to compromise the integrity of the polls. He stated this in Kano, in a remark at the 15th annual conference of Fulbright Alumni Association of Nigeria (FAAN) which took place at the Dangote Business School at the Bayero University, Kano. Speaking as the chairman at the opening ceremony of the two-day conference, Professor Jega decried  the attitude of some lecturers during the poll, whose action he said paved way for faulty recruitment process of the political class during the polls, thereby betraying the confidence the electoral body reposed in them. “Look at what happened during the last elections, and the story of irregularities being spread even in the four walls of BUK. The politicians, through crooked means, got alliances with lecturers in the university to compromise the system and they perpetrated all sort of irregularities, which pave way for a faulty process for the continued entrenchment of bad people in governance,” the former INEC boss said. “Maybe, I am preaching to the converted or I am talking nonsense but frankly speaking, I am beginning to think that we are not taking the obligations of scholarship and intellectual engagement with the seriousness it deserves. “I think the major crisis in Nigeria’s democracy is that our electoral integrity has been under assault, compromised and undermined by those who have control over the process,” he added. Speaking on the theme of the conference,  the Vice Chancellor, Kogi State University, Anyigba, Professor Mohammed Sanni Abdulkadir, urged the Federal Government to improve the  funding of security agencies fighting insurgency and other organized crimes in various fronts across the country with a view to motivating them to be able to carry on their constitutional responsibilities with enthusiasm.
