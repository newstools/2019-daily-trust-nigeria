A ferryboat has collided with a bridge in Brazil’s northern state of Pará, plunging a 200m section into the Moju River. Witnesses said two small cars fell into the water after the ship crashed into one of the pillars. It is unclear, however, how many people have been hurt and scuba divers are searching the river. Five crew members on the ship are said to have survived. Pará governor Helder Barbalho signed a state of emergency after the accident.
