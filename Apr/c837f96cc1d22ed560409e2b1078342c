A forum, United Global Resolve for Peace (UGRP), has urged the Federal Government to immediately review the Treasury Single Account (TSA) with a view to eliminating or reducing the charges being borne by Nigerians. The Executive Director of the UGRP, Shalom Olaseni, who made the demand at the weekend in Abuja at a media conference, also urged government to urgently intervene on behalf of Nigerians whose accounts were suspended by an online trade merchant group, Paxful Inc., based in Estonia. Olaseni said the organisation’s investigation on the service charge being paid by Nigerians for payments made into the TSA and their findings showed that the service charge imposed by the government was an afterthought. “Initially, the government was meant to bear the cost of the TSA, but after a while, the government abdicated their responsibility and dumped it on Nigerians. In view of this fact, we made an application pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act 2011 to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) wherein we requested for some documents which include the service agreement between the Federal Government; the service provider, Systemspecs Ltd. and the records of the procurement process that led to the awarding of the TSA contract to Systemspecs Ltd.,” he said. Olaseni said the CBN agreed to their requests and directed that they followed up on the request at the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation (OAFG) as they had forwarded their request to the OAFG who had custody of the documents requested for.
