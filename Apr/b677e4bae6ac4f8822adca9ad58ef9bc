Tragedy was averted in Owerri on Sunday afternoon when a kerosene-laden tanker overturned its tanks, spilling more than 33,000 litres of its contents on the road. Our correspondent gathered that the tanker, with registration no. XK 748 AGL was coming from Port Harcourt to one of the outlets in Owerri. The tanker was said to have ran into a deep gully at Umuguma Hospital junction in Owerri West when the tank side of the lorry slide sideways and overturned, pouring the entire content on the busy road. Residents, not deterred by the looming danger of possible fire outbreak, trooped out in large numbers to scoop the kerosene. As at the time of filing this report, more and more people are racing to the spot with containers to scoop the product. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer, Orlando Ikeokwu, said a patrol team has been dispatched to ward off members of the public from the looming danger while efforts are being intensified to remove the truck from the road.
