A clergy, Reverend Moses Tswanya, has attributed the spate of insecurity in the country to unemployment and negligence on the part of the leaders. Tswanya, who is the National President of United Missionary Church of Africa (UMCA), said this on Monday at the Church’s headquarters in Ilorin, Kwara state while fielding questions from journalists on the Resurrection of Jesus Christ and Easter message. The UMCA President said though the leaders are trying to ensure peace in the country, they have failed to protect the masses who are badly affected with the spate of killings arising from insurgency, banditry, kidnappings, cattle rustlers, rituals and armed robbery. The Reverend therefore stressed the need to return to God to arrest the minds of the perpetrators of the dastardly acts, pointing out that at this critical period there is need for Nigerians to return to God. He called on Nigerian churches to promote peace and equity in all their dealings, while the focus of the youths should be redirected from materialism to piety. According to him, Nigerian youths are not pursuing their visions anymore, but comparing their lives with others who have excelled, which he attributed as one of the causes of insecurity. Reverend Tswanya therefore charged Nigerian leaders especially those in the helms of affairs to redesign the country’s security architecture and system towards taming the security challenges. He also appealed to Christians to repent from sins to get redemption by feeling sorry and ashamed of their sins and not to return to those sins already committed.
