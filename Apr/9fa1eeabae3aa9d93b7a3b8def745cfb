The Secretary, Social  Development Secretariat, of the Federal Capital Territory Administration, Hajiya  Safiya Umar, has said 21 children have been rescued at Mount Mercy Ark and Less Privilege Home Jiwa and Famous Kids Orphanage Tugan Maje. Jiwa is a community near Deidei, Abuja while Tugan Maje is located between  Zuba-Giri Junction in Gwagwalada Area Council. Hajiya Umar, who spoke to newsmen after the raid, urged traditional rulers in the  territory to assist her officials  succeed in the fight against child  trafficking. She said the Chief of Jiwa, Alhaji Musa Idris, called her to rescue the children from the orphanage, after he suspected that they were trafficked. “This is the right collaboration we want from all the chiefs and chairmen in the six area councils of the FCT. Without this collaboration, we will never have known that such children are kept here,” she said. “These children are not goats, and there  must be something fishy about keeping children like that without recourse to constituted authorities,” Hajiya  Safiya stated. “Children up to 20 are above two people to take care of. Let all the chiefs in the FCT take a cue  from Jiwa chief, because it has shown that they have heard our cries, and are ready to partner with SDS, so that Abuja can be neat and fine,” she said.
