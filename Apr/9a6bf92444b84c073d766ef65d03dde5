A high court sitting in Owerri on Tuesday dismissed two suits challenging the nomination of Uche Nwosu as the governorship candidate of the Action Alliance (AA) in the just concluded election. The court presided over by Justice T. N Nzeukwu, ruled that the suits with suit Nos: HOW/21/2019 and HOW/135/19 lacked merit. The court also held that the two plaintiffs, Sir Leonard Uzoma Okolienta and Ikoku Micheal Obinna lacked the locus standing to bring the action before the court. It averred that issues of nomination of candidates in political parties remained the internal affairs of individual political party. 2019: Uzodinma is Imo APC guber candidate Imo: Ihedioha to get Certificate of Return tomorrow â€“ INEC Imo Governorship: Nwosu commends INEC for omitting APC from provisional list
