The North West Coordinator of the All Progressives Congress (APC), new members of the House of Representatives, Architect Ibrahim Almustapha Aliyu, on Sunday said they support  the party’s endorsement of the incumbent House Leader, Femi Gbajabiamila, as the Speaker of the incoming 9th Assembly. “We toe the party’s line; we have endorsed the choice of Femi Gbajabiamila as the Speaker of the 9th Assembly,” he stated. According to him, the move was to uphold party supremacy, bolster democracy and ensure stability at the Green Chamber. “The forum aims to prevent the ugly development of the 8th assembly, where we tended to tender on a platter of gold our reap to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), by electing persons with uncertain and unstable minds in positions of leadership,” he stated. “It was also to ensure that the laudable policies and programmes of the indefatigable and incorruptible President Muhammadu Buhari sail through in the general interests of Nigerians,” he asserted. Aliyu, who is Reps member-elect for Wurno/Rabah Federal Constituency  added that the forum was taking advantage of its numerical strength of about 164  members, which he noted  constitute a significant number of the 360-member assembly. “This is without the 67 APC returning members. This gives us a comfortable majority,” he said. He reiterated their unalloyed loyalty and commitment to their party, APC. The forum, he disclosed, was essentially formed to appreciate the invaluable gesture of the party for affording its members with the opportunity to run on its platform. “Having being elected and given the mandate freely by the electorate, we need to pay back. We have to remain loyal, as well as uphold the lofty ideals of the APC,” he stressed.
