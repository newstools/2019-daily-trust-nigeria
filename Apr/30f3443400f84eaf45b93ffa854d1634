The Oil and Gas Trainers Association of Nigeria (OGTAN) has decried attitude of some Nigerians for foreign training for reasons of personal gains in preference to patronage and development of local capacities and capabilities, saying that such attitude has kept many trainers out of jobs. Speaking at its 2nd annual conference and exhibition held in Lagos, OGTAN president, Dr. Mayowa Afe, said the attitude has denied the association’s members huge patronage and the necessary inflow for growth and development. He said: “So the biggest challenge facing our members is how to get enough training projects to keep our businesses running even when the necessary infrastructure are in place. We therefore use this forum to seek patronage and partnership with all stake holders”. Afe also demanded for special funding interventions for the association stressing that OGTAN needed a dedicated project and a comprehensive application of the NCDMB/BOI initiative. He also requested, on behalf of OGTAN, a seat on the governing council of relevant government institutions such as PTDF, NCDMB, NBTE and NUC. This, according to him, will help the association contribute her “wealth of industry experience to policy and decision making that will aid the recognition of training as a potent and vital tool for national transformation.” While appreciating President Buhari for the encouragement towards local skills development, especially with the passage of the recent Executive Order No 5, which among other things prohibits the issuance of visas to foreigners for skills available in Nigeria, Afe said the order encourages any required expatriate engagement to have due consideration for transfer of such skills to Nigerians.
