The National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons (NCFRMI) has distributed relief materials for internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Kishi, Oyo State. The Commission is the foremost federal government agency responsible for caring for the displaced. The benefiting IDPs, mainly from Benue and Nasarawa states, were said to have been discovered by one Reverend Father Sylvester Odurinde in 2018. The NCFRMI Federal Commissioner, Hajiya Sadiya Umar Farouq, distributed the items to the beneficiaries at a ceremony held in Kishi on Tuesday. The items included foodstuffs, mattresses, bedsheets, kitchen utensils, buckets and food items, all worth N10m. Farouq, who was represented by Mrs Funmi Bara, as well as the South West Zonal Director, Margaret Ngozi Ukegbu and other members of staff, said the items were to provide relief for the IDPs. Responding, the beneficiaries lauded the NCFRMI, saying it was the first federal government agency to intervene with such a large quantity of relief materials. They also commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the gesture and appealed to him to support them with more amenities, building materials and medical intervention.
