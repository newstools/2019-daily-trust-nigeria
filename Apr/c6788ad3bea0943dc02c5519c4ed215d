The Tin-Can Island Port Command of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) says it generated N78.8 billion in the first quarter of 2019, up from N76.7 billion realised in the corresponding period of 2018. NCS Area Controller, Mohammed Musa, made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria(NAN) in Lagos on Sunday. He said the command projected an income of N84 billion during the period under review but it generated about 94 per cent of the target. Musa said the command was given a target of N343 billion for 2019, saying that it surpassed the target for two months but the election holidays affected the revenue in March. He said the command was working hard to boost the revenue and surpassed the revenue generated in 2018. According to him, the command was committed to the transformation of revenue collection and reporting system with the implementation of Nigeria Integrated Customs Information System (NICIS). â€œThere is improvement on compliance in the command, mostly because of the policies and directive from the headquarters insisting on 100 per cent examination of imported cargo with regard to protection of the environment.
