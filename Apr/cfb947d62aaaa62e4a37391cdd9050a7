The Nigerian Association for Energy Economics (NAEE) has added its voice to the numerous calls for the Federal Government to end subsidy on petrol. The International Monetary Fund had during the week called on the government to remove fuel subsidy, saying it was the right thing to do. Speaking at a press conference at the weekend ahead of the 12th NAEE/ International Association for Energy Economics (IAEE) conference in Abuja, president of the association, Prof. Wumi Iledare, said the benefit of petroleum subsidy was far less than the cost. He said, “Anytime a government has a policy there is need for it to be reviewed to see whether the benefit that comes from the policy is more than the cost or they are about equivalent. All you need to do is to look around; the roads are bad, the schools, the hospitals are bad and infrastructures are not even there. Look at the budget for health, education, defence and add them up and you will see that it is not up to petroleum subsidy in 2018. Is it not time for the government to look at it?” He said though removal of subsidy will lead to social unrest, adequate public education would enable the populace understand the harm petrol subsidy has caused them. The 3-day NAEE/IAEE annual international conference, which will hold in Abuja on April 14- 2 16, 2019, has a distinctive theme, ‘Energy Access and Efficiency Imperatives for Sustainable Development in Emerging Economies’, and will feature presentation of 64 technical papers, an opening ceremony and two plenary sessions.
