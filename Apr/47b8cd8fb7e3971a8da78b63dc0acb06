Victims of rainstorms that ravaged some towns in the Akoko area of Ondo State last week have received some relief materials from the state government. Items donated included bundles of roofing sheets, various sizes of nails and other accessories. More than 600 families in Ikare and Supare Akoko had lost their homes and property worth millions of naira to the rainstorms. Worst hit in Ugbe Akoko were the Igbede, Ishakunmi and Oyinmo quarters, where over 70 per cent of the houses and schools, as well as the police station in the town were badly affected. The Onisupare of Supare, Oba Adedeji Adejoro, who received the items on behalf of the community, lauded the timely intervention of the state government and its response to the plight of the people. According to Oba Adejoro, it was unprecedented in the history of the state to receive such help from government within a very short notice, adding that the people were not expecting anything this early until they began to see the items coming in. He said that the gesture would go a long way in ameliorating the pains of the victims. Another beneficiary at Ikare Akoko, Akoko North West local government, Mr Lucas Omotosho, expressed gratitude to the government, saying he can now have more confidence in promises by the present administration. Handing over the items to the beneficiaries, the Deputy Governor, Mr Agboola Ajayi, said the gesture was in demonstration of governmentâ€™s commitment to the welfare of its citizens. Ajayi noted that though government was still considering further measures to aid the people, the immediate donation of the roofing materials became imperative to save the affected houses from further damage.  600 families lose homes to rainstorm in Ondo Alkaleri rainstorm victims get relief materials Ekiti: Monarch, 299 other disaster victims benefit from FG relief materials
