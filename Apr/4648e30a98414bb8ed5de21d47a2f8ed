Five persons died and six others were injured yesterday in an accident at Jattu Junction, Auchi, Edo State, on the Benin-Abuja Highway. Witnesses said the crash occurred when a cement-loaded truck coming from the north lost control and rammed into several vehicles held by traffic at the junction. The Edo State Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps, Anthony Oko, confirmed the accident, saying it was a multiple one. He, however, attributed the accident, which happened around 11:00am, to a burst tyre. He said: “15 people were involved in the accident, five died; while six sustained various degrees of injuries.  Seven vehicles were involved in the accident.” According to him, “the truck coming towards Benin had a tyre burst and in the process lost control and rammed into the vehicles from behind.” He said those injured were taken to the morgue; while those injured were to a hospital for treatment. 5 killed in Edo crash 3 killed, 10 injured in Edo auto crash 51 die in Sokoto, Kogi, Abia, Osun road crashes
