The police in Jigawa State, has dispersed a group of youth who gathered at Aminu kano Triangle in Dutse, for a planned protest against the increasing spate of insecurity in the country. The youth, who gathered under the auspices of Jigawa Concern Youth, planned to go round the metropolis in procession with a view to pass their massage to the appropriate authority. The leader of the group, Umar Danjani, told newsmen that the decision to embark on the protest was informed by the increasing cases of murder and kidnapping of innocent Nigerians. He said the protest was meant to compel the authorities concerned to wake up from their slumber by deploying appropriate measures capable of bringing the situation under control. In his response, the state police commissioner, Bala Zama Senchi, said the police had to stop the Jigawa Concern Youth from staging their protest because they did not secure the appropriate permit for doing so.
