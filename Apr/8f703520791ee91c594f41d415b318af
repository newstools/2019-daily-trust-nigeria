Reports of crisis within the Lagos APC over the cabinet of the incoming administration of governor-elect Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu are mere speculations, a chieftain of the party, Chief Tajudeen Olusi, has said. There have been media reports over the composition of the cabinet of the incoming governor, which is said to be causing disagreement between the Mandate Group and the Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC). Daily Trust learnt that the raging disagreement has delayed the composition of the transition committee by the governor-elect. However, Chief Olusi in an interview with our correspondent insisted there was no disagreement over the two issues, noting that many reports suggesting crisis in Lagos APC failed to quote any credible source. He said: “The composition of a transition committee is purely an affair between the outgoing governor and the incoming governor. “To the best of my knowledge, I know there is cordiality between the two individuals and I can tell you that at the appropriate time, when they are ready, they would release the transition committee list. We still have a long way; we still have over a month. The inauguration is May 29. So, don’t let us encourage all this speculation.” On the issue of the cabinet, he said at the appropriate time, the list would be out in accordance with the constitutional provision of at least one commissioner per local government.
