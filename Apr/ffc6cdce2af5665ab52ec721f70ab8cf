Benue State government on Monday imposed a 24 hour-curfew on Katsina-Ala town in the state. Daily Trust reports that fear escalated in the rural town as five more persons were said to be kidnapped on Sunday after 11 people were allegedly killed by local militias in Ngibo and Tse-Aye villages in Ikyurav-Tiev 1, a council ward in Katsina-Ala local government area of the state on Saturday. The gunmen were also said to have carted away 28 cattle belonging to one Barr.
