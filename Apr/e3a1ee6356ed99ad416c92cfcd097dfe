A 40-year-old man, Sulaimon Musa, has been remanded on the order of an Ogba chief magistrate court in Lagos for allegedly engaging his neighbour’s son in anal sex. The police told the court that Musa had been engaging the teenager in anal sex at their Baale Street, Ajegunle, Lagos, residence since the boy was just 11 years old. The prosecutor, Inspector Benson Emerhi, said it was an observer who eventually drew the attention of the boy’s parents to the unusual closeness between the boy and the accused. Emerhi said Musa had warned the boy not to tell his parents the first time he had anal sex with him. When his victim, according to the police, complained of pains in his anus after the act, the accused bought him some gifts. He said the man’s clandestine moves, however, became exposed last Monday when the boy emerged from Musa’s room after his parents had been looking for him. “The boy was confronted by his parents and he confessed. On close examination, it was discovered that the boy’s anus had been bruised because of the forceful anal penetrations.The matter was reported to the police and Musa was arrested. The matter was later transferred to the Gender Section of the police command for investigation,” he added. The accused was subsequently dragged to court on a two-count charge of defilement and sodomy. The court did not take his plea after Inspector Emerhi asked the court for the file to be sent to the Lagos State Department of Public Prosecution for legal advice. The magistrate, Mrs O.Sule Amzat, ordered him to be remanded in prison custody without an option of bail  Man remanded for allegedly sodomising 10-yr-old boy Court remands man for allegedly defiling 7-yr-old girl Police arrest man for allegedly infecting boy with HIV
