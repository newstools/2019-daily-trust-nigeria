The Pan-Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere, yesterday berated comment credited to Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi, on restructuring. Fayemi had during a national retreat by Afenifere Renewal Group in Ado-Ekiti said the proponents of restructuring in the southwest should interface with other zones to actualize their mission. But Afenifere, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary Yinka Odumakin, accused Fayemi of mischief. Odumakin said the Afenifere leaders toeing the path of the late sage, Obafemi Awolowo, had reached out to all sections of the country at every point in time to build national consensus on restructuring. He said at the 2014 National Conference for instance, Yoruba delegates worked nights and days with leaders across Nigeria to build consensus. “In the last four years that the APC government, which Fayemi is part of, has made the idea of restructuring a “mirage” in spite of deceiving Nigerians with Federalism on their manifesto in 2015, proponents of restructuring in the South West have worked with other regions in the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum and the Nigerian Leaders and Elders Forum which included Northern Elders Forum to promote the idea of federalism.” He alleged that the Federal Government only used a committee headed by Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai to hoodwink the “unwary.” Afenifere slams Fayemi on restructuring comment Afenifere leaders want Yoruba presidency in 2023, root for Fayemi Atiku’s restructuring agenda a scam — PDP ex-Lagos chair
