Some stakeholders in maritime on Friday advised the Federal Government to abolish cabotage waivers to foreign vessels and grant incentives that would encourage indigenous ship ownership in the spirit and letter of  the Cabotage Act. The stakeholders gave the advice in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos State. They said it was possible to end waivers to foreign vessels and give room for Nigerians to own ships. The Federal Government had on Wednesday presented to the public, a five-year plan to bring to an end, waivers given to foreign vessels trading on the nation’s waters. The Director-General of the Nigeria Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr Dakuku Peterside, made this known at a two-day Stakeholders’ Consultative Meeting in Lagos. Mr Obigali Obi, Director-General of Nigerian Chamber of Shipping, said efforts should be geared toward resuscitating the Ajaokuta Steel Company because the country could build ship with a functional steel company, which  would in turn encourage  springing  up  of cottage industries. Another stakeholder, Mrs Magret Orakwusi, appealed to the Federal Government to ensure banks grant loans to Nigerian shippers at a single-digit rate to boost ship ownership and development. According to him, the plan will see an end to building of such vessel from outside the country in four years, to give room for Nigerian indigenous ship building and development (NAN) NIMASA, stakeholders urge FG to end waiver to foreign ship owners NIMASA ends cabotage waiver regime, 16 years after Cabotage: FG ends waivers to oil firms
