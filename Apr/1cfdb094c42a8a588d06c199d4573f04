A notable PDP chieftain, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, has said that people of the South-East region will not stoop so low to beg for leadership position in either arm of the National Assembly. Iwuanyanwu, who spoke with our correspondent in Owerri, said since the Igbo by nature were not used to playing second fiddle, they would not be subservient to the extent of begging anybody for their rights. According to him, it is the right of the South-East to produce the Senate President as a major actor in the Nigerian project after the North and the South West have clinched the positions of President and Vice President respectively. He said the current arrangement in the sharing of principal offices in the National Assembly by the ruling APC was to further undermine the position of Ndigbo as one of the three major tribes in the country. Iwuanyanwu, while alluding to the fact  that the Igbo did not have anything against President Muhammadu Buhari as being insinuated, said a fundamental mistake was made in 2015 when a son of the Eastern region, Goodluck Jonathan, was running for a second term and the Igbo voted for him. He, however, regretted that it was interpreted to mean that by not voting for the APC,  Ndigbo hated Buhari.
