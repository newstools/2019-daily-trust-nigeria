The chairman-elect of Bwari Area Council, Mr John Gabaya, has expressed optimism that the FCT area councils election tribunal will validate his victory at the March 2019 poll. He called on the incumbent chairman, “Musa Dikko, not to waste your time”. Gabaya who spoke with City News, yesterday, in Dutsen Alhaji, said he was surprised that Dikko, whom he had always considered a boss and mentor, would petition the outcome of the election which he clearly won. He urged Dikko to, as a matter of honour, come out and tell the people of Bwari that he had taken him (Gabaya) to the tribunal and stop hiding behind his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC). “It is surprising that Musa Dikko has denied taking me to the tribunal on the pages of newspapers. I want to tell the people of Bwari Area Council that the number one petitioner is Hon. Musa Dikko. So it is laughable that he has claimed it is his party, the APC, that has taken me to the tribunal and not him,” he said. Asked if he was afraid that his victory would be upturned at the tribunal, he said he was confident the people voted for him and the peoples’ mandate would be validated by the tribunal. “Musa Dikko congratulated me two days after the election. He knew I won that was why he congratulated me. For him to petition my victory at the tribunal and still come out shows the dilemma he is in and I will want him to do the honourable thing and withdraw the petition because he is still my boss and mentor,” Gabaya added.
