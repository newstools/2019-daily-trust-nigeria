To connect all Nigerian major cities by rail, the Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi has said the federal governed will need to make about $40bn investments, representing about N12.24trn at the exchange rate of N306/$1). The Minister said based on the huge resources required, Nigerians should be patient with the federal government as they deliver the infrastructure as resources are available. Amount needed is about 150 percent of the 2019 budget estimate. Mr. Amaechi who spoke weekend in Ibadan, Oyo state during his routine inspection of the 156km Lagos to Ibadan double gauge rail project under construction also said the government is open to private investors willing to invest in Nigeria’s railways. The inspection began from Lagos and ended in Ibadan at the site of the Nigeria’s Shippers Council supported dry port Ibadan. On the entourage was a delegation from the Ghanaian transport ministry led by the minister, the senate committee on land transport and the Executive Secretary, Nigerian Shippers Council, Mr. Hassan Bello. The Ghanaian delegation had come to access the quality o work done as they also intend to build same facility. “I tell Nigerians, everybody has to be patient because we need between $36 to $40bn to be able to do that connectivity,” he said. On the lingering coastal rail he said “we have not gotten money. We are even still looking for money for Lagos to Kano. I come from South-South and I am emotionally attached to that project but it is unfortunate that we have not gotten money. It was awarded under President Jonathan and President Obasanjo.  The directive of the President is that we should do everything possible to get the inter-connectivity of the tracks” he explained.
