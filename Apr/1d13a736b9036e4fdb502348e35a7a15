The Senator representing the FCT, Philip Aduda,  has donated 10 tricycles, popularly known as Keke NAPEP, to butchers across the six area councils. Sen. Aduda, represented by an FCT House of Representatives member-elect, Alhaji Hassan Sokodabo,  while presenting the tricycles last Thursday in Abuja,  said the gesture was a deliberate move to support the butchers. He said he procured the tricycles for the butchers to enable them use them to convey meat to the market, saying it was part of measures to enhance haulage of meat under hygienic conditions. He added that the donation of the tricycles would also enhance and improve service delivery of the butchers. The senator further pledged to continue impacting on the lives of the good people of the territory through executing projects that would have direct bearing on their lives. The Chairman of the Abuja Butchers Association (ABA), Alhaji Aminu Sarkin Ruwa, while receiving the tricycles on behalf of the association, commended Sen. Aduda for the gesture, saying the tricycles would reduce the stress the butchers faced while conveying meat to the market. Alhaji Ruwa added that the tricycles would also encourage them to be more committed in their business across the six area councils,  and therefore, assured the senator of the association’s continuous support.
