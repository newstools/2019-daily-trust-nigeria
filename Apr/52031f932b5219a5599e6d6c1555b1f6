The Nigerian government has expressed their strong condemnation over the execution of a Nigerian Mrs. Kudirat Adesola Afolabi in Saudi Arabia over drug-related offences. This was made known in a statement signed by the Amb. Mustapha Lawal Suleiman, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday. “While Nigeria respects the sovereignty of States, and abhors the violation of domestic laws of any country, the Government however does not condone such inhumane treatment being meted on a Nigerian national,” the statement read. The ministry also greatly disapproved of Saudi Arabian authorities of not communicating with the Nigerian missions beforehand, after which they only extended an invite before the deceased was to be executed on 1st April. The ministry also reassured Nigerians that they have engaged Saudi authorities through the envoy in Nigeria, to ensure that the practice of informing missions before arrests are adhered to, and Nigerians are given a fair chance of justice in the country.
