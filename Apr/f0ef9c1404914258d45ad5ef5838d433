Osun State Governor Gboyega Oyetola has enjoined citizens to imbibe the spirit of philanthropy and service to God and humanity. He spoke in Ikire weekend at the inauguration of a 138-year-old mosque rebuilt by the state Supervisor for Finance, Commerce and Industry, Bola Oyebamiji. According to the governor, since worldly things are ephemeral, it is incumbent on those favoured with abundant resources to deploy their wealth to assist the needy. Oyetola charged well-to-do citizens to help the needy and join hands with his government to advance the economy of the state for the benefit of the people. “Helping one another is directly proportional to helping the government since government is constituted to guarantee the security of lives and property of the citizens as well as the general welfare of all. We should all emulate the kind-heartedness and philanthropic gestures,” Oyetola said. In his sermon, the guest lecturer, Sheik Abdul-Gafar Muhammed Yaya, called on well-meaning Nigerians to cultivate the habit of humanitarian development.
