At least 30 people have been killed and hundreds more injured as a violent thunderstorm swept southern Nepal. The freak storm destroyed houses, overturned vehicles, uprooted trees and brought down power lines in Bara and Parsa districts, officials said. The casualties included passengers in a bus that was blown off a road, witnesses said. Kusum Kalu, 70, told the BBC she had escaped death “by a fraction of a second” when the storm struck. “I was about to leave the house and just as I opened the door the roof of the house fell down,” she told BBC Nepali in Bara district. “I don’t think I would have survived had I already gone to bed or been a fraction of a second late to open the door.” What happened in Baga?
