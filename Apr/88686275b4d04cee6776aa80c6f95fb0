An unemployed man, Kunle Bisi, on Monday in Lagos  appeared  in an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court for allegedly stealing motor spare parts valued at N500,000.   The defendant, 48, who resides at Oshodi, Lagos, however, pleaded innocence to a two- count charge of breach of peace and stealing.   According to the Prosecutor, Insp. Aondohemba Koti, the defendant committed the offence on April 19 at Ladipo, Mushin in Lagos.   He said that the defendant conducted himself in a manner likely to cause breach of peace by trespassing into the warehouse of Mr Osita Nwafor to steal his goods.   Koti said that the security guard sighted the defendant carrying the spare parts out of the warehouse and intercepted him.   “On sighting the security guard coming towards him, the defendant dropped the goods and took to his heels.   “The guard ran after him, he was apprehended and handed over to the police,” the prosecutor said.   The offence contravened the provision of Sections 168(d) and 287 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.   News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 287 stipulates three years imprisonment for stealing if convicted.   Magistrate Mrs M.O Tanimola granted the defendant bail of N100, 000 with two sureties in like sum.   Tanimola said that the sureties should be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government.   The case was adjourned until May 15 for mention.
