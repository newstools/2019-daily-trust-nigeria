The Governorship, National and State Houses of Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal in Kwara State says it has so far received two petitions over the just concluded gubernatorial poll. Speaking with journalists, yesterday in Ilorin, the secretary of the tribunal, Adamu Aliyu, said it received only one petition on outcome of the state House of Assembly election. Aliyu said the two governorship petitions, challenging the qualification of governor-elect, Alhaji Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq of the APC to contest the March 9 governorship election, were filed by the PDP and its governorship candidate, Razak Atunwa, as well as Action Alliance (AA). The petition of the PDP and its flagbearer, which put the INEC as the first respondent, said that the APC governor-elect was at the time of the election not qualified to contest. The petition also alleged that the governor-elect submitted to INEC an affidavit containing false information of a fundamental nature in aid of his qualification for the said election.
