Ethiopian Airlines, the largest aviation group in Africa, has concluded plan to launch flight services to the city of Beira in Central Mozambique via Malawi effective from September 3, 2019. Beira is the fourth largest and one of the main commercial cities in Mozambique and will serve as a gateway to most of the countries in Central Africa with potential tourist attractions. It will be a thrice weekly service on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday on Flight 0881, a statement from the airline indicated. The Group CEO of Ethiopian Airlines, Mr. Tewolde GebreMariam, said the airline had been filling the connectivity vacuum in Africa with its flight operations. He said, “Covering the largest network in Africa and connecting major world trading cities across our global network, we have been filling the connectivity vacuum in the continent not only with primary cities in countries, but also with secondary and tertiary cities and towns. “Our customers in these smaller cities will get special opportunity to connect to our global network of more than 120 international destinations in five continents with direct flights and fewer stops. Supporting our main hub in Maputo, Beira will serve as our hub in Central Mozambique directly connecting passengers to our global hub in Addis Ababa for further connections to various parts of the world.” Based in Maputo, Mozambique’s capital, Ethiopian Mozambique Airlines serves eight domestic points in Mozambique: Nampula, Tete, Pemba, Beira, Nacala, Quelimane, Vilankulos and Chimoio, including Maputo.
