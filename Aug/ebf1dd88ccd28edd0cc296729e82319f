The General Manager of Kwara State Television Authority, Alhaji Abdulfatai Adewale Adebowale, was yesterday detained at the Ilorin Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over allegations bordering on land fraud. Adebowale was interrogated alongside a senior official of the Kwara State Bureau of Lands and two members of staff of the state television authority located at Apata Yakuba Area of Ilorin. A former governor, Alhaji Abdulfatai Ahmed, had in 2014 allocated 10 plots of land in the premises of the media outfit to some staff of the television station. Thirteen members of staff through their petition dated May 8, 2019 alleged that the station’s general manager had sold the plots. They alleged that since 2014, the said plots were hijacked by the general manager against the purpose intended by the state government. In 2017, the in staff union, (RATTAWU), started agitation for the recovery of the land led to a plethora of correspondences with the office of the state’s Head of Service. It was gathered that the Kwara State Television boss received allocation papers in the names of staff but did not deliver the documents to the original owners. The suspects will soon be charged to court, according to the EFCC.
