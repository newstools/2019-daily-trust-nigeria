The accused person, Lanre Olufowokan, is facing trial on a two-count criminal charge of disrespecting a court order obstructing Sherrif Disu in the discharge of his duties. The offence is punishable under Section 104 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015. According to police prosecutor Inspector Edward Abiodun, Olufowokan committed the offence on March 12, 2019 at about 9.45am at No. 6, Emma Abimbola Cole Street, Lekki Phase 1, Lagos, by intentionally disrespecting an order of a court and obstructing Sherrif Disu, an officer of the Lagos State judiciary, from pasting necessary court documents on the above-mentioned address.
