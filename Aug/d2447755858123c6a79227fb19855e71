An Ogun State House of Assembly member representing Odeda constituency, Oludaisi Elemide, has asked the federal government to expand the Asero-Obantoko road in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. Elemide noted that expansion of the busy road, known for endless gridlock, would boost business activities in the area. The lawmaker told journalists in Abeokuta yesterday that the road, which was constructed in the early 1970s, remained the main road that connects Ogun State with Oyo State from Abeokuta. The road required expansion to ease the heavy traffic encountered on it daily, he submitted. “There are no motorable feeder roads on that stretch. If we have feeder roads, the traffic load on that main road would be reduced. But considering the current situation there, we need urgent attention on the road. “There is traffic from morning till night. What people don’t realise is that we burn more fuel and precious time is being wasted. From Moore junction to Asero and to Obantoko, there is a setback so government doesn’t need to demolish many buildings to widen the road, and the cost of construction will be very low. “If the road is done, it will boost economic activities and the cost of property around there will appreciate. Socially, health-wise and educationally, this road needs to be expanded,” he added.   357km road, 15 flyovers completed in Ogun – Amosun "82 percent of vehicles plying Nigerian roads unworthy" - Expert FG to expand N-Power by 500,000 – Osinbajo Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
