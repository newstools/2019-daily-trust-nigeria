The Coordinator of National Agency For Food, Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) in Yobe state, Lawan Musa Dadingelma, has warned residents against buying drugs from hawkers and unregistered medicine sellers. In an interview with Kanem Trust on Thursday, the coordinator said the practice is dangerous since they normally expose the drugs to a very hot temperature. He said  such drugs become dangerous since they  get bad even before their expiry dates due to exposure to harsh weather conditions. “We have embarked on enlightenment campaign to the public on the dangers of consuming drugs displayed under the sun but due to poverty and other factors they prefer buying from the hawkers,” he said. Dadingelma said his team had on surveillance operation arrested and confiscated drugs from 10 hawkers operating within Damaturu Sunday market. “As part of our mandates to protect the public from consuming expired drugs, we arrested 10 drug hawkers in Damaturu Sunday market for displaying drugs in baskets under the sun,” he said. The coordinator said the Agency is currently investigating sources of the confiscated drugs with a set penalty on any person found guilty of illegal drugs transaction across the state.
