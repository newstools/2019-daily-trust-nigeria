The Adamawa Police Command says it has arrested a 19-year-old man, Adamu Abdullahi, who allegedly raped a five-year-old girl in Yola town. The command’s spokesman, DSP Suleiman Yahaya, said on Monday in Yola, that the command was informed of the incident when the girl was taken to hospital for treatment. Yahaya said the incident occurred on August 23, but the parents of the girl concealed it from neighbours and the police. He said Abdullahi lured her into an uncompleted building and had carnal knowledge of the girl, which resulted in severe injuries on her. “The parents wanted to hide the incident, but when they realised they could not manage the injury, they took her to a hospital and the police was invited by the hospital management. “When the Commissioner of Police heard of it, he ordered for the arrest of the suspect,” Yahaya said. The PPRO said the suspect would be charged to court after investigation.
