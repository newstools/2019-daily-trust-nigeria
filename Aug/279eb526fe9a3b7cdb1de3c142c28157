Ahead of the September 3 governorship primary of the PDP in Bayelsa State, the hitherto cordial relationship between Governor Seriake Dickson and his deputy, Rear Admiral Gboribiogha John-Jonah (rtd), seems to have gone sour. The deputy governor was said to be miffed by Governor Dickson’s decision to endorse three members of his restoration team without due consultation with other key players in the family. Jonah, who did not initially indicate interest to contest the governorship election, had gone ahead to pick his nomination form few days after the Special Adviser on Political Affairs to Governor Dickson, Mr Feynman Wilson, released a statement indicating that the caucus had chosen the incumbent Secretary to Bayelsa State Government, Barr. Kemela Okara; Chief of Staff to the governor, Talford Ongolo and the Senator representing Bayelsa central senatorial district, Douye Diri, as preferred aspirants that would slug it out during the primaries. According to Wilson, the meeting followed the successful conclusion of the three days fasting and prayer session which was organized by the state to seek God’s face on the critical issue of selecting the next governorship candidate of PDP in the state. Retired Rear Admiral John-Jonah who picked his expression of interest and nomination forms at the national secretariat of the party a few days after the announcement, said he was moved by the passion to serve the people and continue with the development strides initiated by Governor Dickson in the state.
