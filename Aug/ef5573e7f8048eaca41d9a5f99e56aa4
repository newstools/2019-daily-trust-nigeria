Twenty five lucky subscribers have been rewarded with a total of N1.25 million in the ongoing StarTimes Kids billed to last till August 31. The pay-TV giant had announced in July that 100 of its subscribers would be rewarded with a total of N5m with 25 people emerging from weekly draws every week from August 1, as part of effort to cushion the cost of back-to- school items and school fees for its subscribers. When contacted, one of the winners from Abuja, Alaba Aliyu, expressed joy over the win. She explained that although she knew about the promo, she did not expect to win as she had never won in any promotion by any company. Another winner, Okoh Linus, a subscriber in Enugu, said he was more than happy to have emerged a winner. According to him, the cash gift would go a long way. The Public Relations Manager of StarTimes, Kunmi Balogun, said, “The promo is still on and more winners will be announced this week. The promotion continues; this week another set of 25 winners will come from a draw. All you need to do as a subscriber is to pay a minimum of two months subscription on our Basic, Classic or Super Bouquet to qualify.” StarTimes is the leading digital TV operator in Africa, serving nearly 20 million users through DTT, DTH and online streaming platforms with 480 authorised channels.
