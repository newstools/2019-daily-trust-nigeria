A former Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, Alhaji Mukhtar Ahmad Anka, a former Speaker of the House of Assembly, Alhaji Bature Umar Sambo, and and ex-Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Alhaji Muhammad Bawa Gusau, yesterday, defected to the ruling PDP in the state. The defectors who pitched their tent with the ruling party alongside their 8,000 supporters, said more people had indicated interest to join the train on its way to salvage the state. The defected politicians also included a former Commissioner for Youths and Skills Acquisition, Alhaji Abdullahi Muhammad Gurbin Baure, seven serving councillors and 194 ward chairmen of the opposition APC. Speaking during their formal reception into the PDP, Anka said they were moved by the exemplary leadership style of Gov. Bello Muhammad Mutawalle. Responding, Gov. Muhammad Mutawalle said his administration was maintaining an open-door policy, and that he was ready to accept constructive criticism and valuable suggestions. “We are making effort to restore peace to the state and our effort is yielding great result. Those living in our rural communities will testify to that. Economic activities have started picking up as rural markets have opened again,” he added.
