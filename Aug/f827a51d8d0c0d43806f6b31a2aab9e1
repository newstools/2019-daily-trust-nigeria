The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has finally agreed to shut down the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu, for major repairs. The closure of the runway will take effect from August 24, according to a statement by the spokesperson of FAAN, Mrs. Henrietta Yakubu. Daily Trust on Sunday reports that the Federal Government through the immediate past Minister of State for Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, had said the closure of the runway was inevitable following some security concerns which pose threat to flight operations. Apart from the runway which is in a dilapidated condition, the proximity of a market to the runway as well as a broadcast mast is said to be posing challenges to safe operations. It was learnt that the move to close the runway for extensive operations came after series of consultation between FAAN and Enugu State Government. FAAN Managing Director, Capt. Hamisu Yadudu met several times with Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, on finding workable solutions to the challenges facing the airport. FAAN yesterday notified airlines, passengers and all other stakeholders that the runway “will be closed for major repairs and works on the airfield.” The authority said the move “is aimed at resolving the existing Safety/Security concerns to flight operations. A date to reopen the runway will be communicated in due course.” JUST IN: Finally, FG shuts Enugu Airport Airlines adjust Enugu flights over runway repair Why Enugu airport can’t operate at night Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
