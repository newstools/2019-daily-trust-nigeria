The Atiku Abubakar Democratic Institute (AADI) has applauded what it described as the “support so far enjoyed from Nigerian masses.” AADI expressed confidence that the former vice president had a good case against the victory of President Muhammadu Buhari in the February presidential election. At a briefing in Lagos, the Director General (DG) of AADI, Dr. Adetokunbo Pearse, said the support so far demonstrated by Nigerians had shown that they were solidly behind Atiku’s candidacy and that the peoples’ support would soon pay off with imminent success. Dr. Pearse who was also the Lagos State governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), recalled that “the near-victory” recorded by the former vice president in Lagos State during the presidential election was as a result of his acceptability among the Nigerian masses who were tired of the current administration. He said, “Atiku nearly won Lagos. Such impressive performance was not as a result of the effort we put in, but because Atiku’s personality resonates with those at the grassroots who on their own mobilised to vote him massively.” 2019: Tambuwal, Makarfi agree to work for Atiku How APC Can Win 2015 Presidency Buhari promises inclusive govt, Atiku heads to court Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
