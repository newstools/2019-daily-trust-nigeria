The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has again assured stakeholders in Delta State and the Niger Delta in general that it has no plan to relocate the headquarters of its subsidiary, Nigerian Gas Company (NGC) from its present location in Delta State to somewhere outside the region. The NNPC in a press release by its Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Ndu Ughamadu described as unfortunate statement credited to Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege where he reportedly condemned alleged moves by the corporation to relocate NGC headquarters from the Niger Delta. While calling on the NGC host communities and other stakeholders to disregard the relocation tale which it described as totally false, the corporation said the Deputy Senate President may have either been misinformed or was quoted out of context, noting that the subject of relocation of NGC was never on the table for deliberation by the NNPC management. The corporation said the focus of the current NNPC management under the headship of Mallam Mele Kyari is to ensure harmonious relationship with stakeholders and host communities in such a way as to entrench a win-win scenario for all concerned. NNPC says has no plans to relocate NGMC to Abuja PEACE IN N''DELTA: Stakeholders Demand Payment of 13% Derivation Direct to Oil Producing Communities, says its illegal for State Govt to administer the fund Is that not the voice of Jacob?
