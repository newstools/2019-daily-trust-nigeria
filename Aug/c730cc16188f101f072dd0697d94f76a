The main pan-Igbo group, Ohaneze Ndigbo, has warned Igbo people, especially the youths, against hitting up the polity by discussing the 2023 presidential election. Ohaneze said the agitation was ill-timed when the 2019 presidential election outcome was still being contested in court. The South South Coordinator of Ohaneze Youth Wing, Chief Chinedu Arthur-Ugwa, while speaking with Journalists in Yenagoa yesterday, urged the people of Igbo extraction to always seek for the opinion of elders and national leaders of Ohaneze, led by Chief John Nwodo, before engaging in any national discourse. Chief Nwodo condemned the situation where some Igbo youths had begun moving around endorsing people for the 2023 presidency, saying such activity was a distraction to the people of the ethnic group. He said, “We want to call the pubic to disregard any statement made by the so called ‘Ohaneze youths’ because they are moving around tarnishing the image of our organisation and the Igbo nation; that is why we urge Igbo people all over the world to work towards ensuring peace in Igbo land.” He further said, “We should not talk about the politics of 2023 for now. The issues arising from the last elections are being contested in court. So, we should not hit up the polity by starting another campaign. “Igbo youths should not be interested in 2023 politics for now; what should bother us most is peace in Igbo land. So, let’s work towards it and put our house in order.” It is too early to start 2023 politics, Ohaneze tells Igbos 2019: Ohaneze endorses Atiku/Obi 2019: Ohaneze Ndigbo denies endorsing Atiku Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
