Three policemen and one civilian; Inspector Mark Edaile, Sergeant Usman Danzumi, Sergeant Dahiru Musa and Olajide Owolabi, who arrested Wadume, were killed by soldiers along Ibi-Wukari road in Taraba state, on 7 August 2019. The policemen were from the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Intelligence Response Team (IRT). Daily Trust gathered yesterday from a source familiar with the investigation that after the shooting the soldiers moved all the killed policemen and the wounded to their base, including kidnap suspect Wadume, who was still in handcuff and leg chain. It was from the military base that the captain moved Wadume to his personal residence in Ibi, after which he was freed. A welder was allegedly called to free Wadume from the handcuffs and leg chain.
