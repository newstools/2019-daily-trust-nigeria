Thirteen aspirants are jostling to pick the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ticket in a tight contest ahead of the November 16 governorship election in Kogi. Amongst those who had bought forms ahead of the party’s primaries billed for September 3, included immediate past governor of the state, Idris Wada and Senator Dino Melaye. Others in race included Abubakar Ibrahim, Dr Victor Adoji, Emmanuel Omebije, Dr Joseph Ameh Erico, QS Aminu Suleiman, Engr. Musa Wada, Princess Grace Adejoh, AVM Salihu Attawodi, Mohammed Shaibu Tetes, Alhaji Kabiru Haruna Saraha and Bayo Averehi. Daily Trust reports that each aspirant paid N24 million to obtain the party’s nomination and expression of interest forms, implying that the PDP had raked  in N312 million from the sale of forms ahead of the November governorship election. The PDP having adopted the indirect primary method for the Kogi gubernatorial election, aspirants were now doing lots of consultations and underground works to woo delegates ahead of the exercise. Perhaps, the interesting aspect of the contest is that former Governor Idris Wada and the son of his political godfather, Abubakar Ibrahim Idris (Ibro) are in the race. Similarly, Wada’s younger brother, Engr. Musa Wada is also in the race. Observers said the contest would be a fierce one amongst the aspirants and only time would tell who would eventually emerge the flag bearer of the main opposition party.
