In the resumed hearing on the petition filed by the PDP and its governorship candidate, Abba Kabir Yusuf, the petitioners yesterday requested the governorship election tribunal to avail them with a copy of the records of proceedings of the tribunal. Counsel to the petitioners, Sadiq Sabo Kurawa, told the tribunal that the petitioners were reviewing their case and would like to use the records of the proceedings as a guide for their next line of action. Addressing journalists, Kurawa said the records would guide the petitioners on the witnesses that they would call, taking into consideration that they had only a day to exhaust the 14 days given to them. The coordinator of the legal team to Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, Barr. M.A. Lawan, alleged that the petitioners were supposed to bring in more witnesses but instead kept running from pillar to post knowing that their case had no merit. Barr. Lawan said, “It is not surprising anyway, because we all know that the case has no merit and that is why they have been running from pillar to post to see how they will be able to patch it up. It cannot be patched. I believe this is a dead petition.” In her ruling, the presiding Judge, Justice Halima S. Muhammad, granted the request of the petitioners to obtain the records of proceedings and adjourned the case to today for continuation.
