The Chairman, Igbo Traditional Rulers Forum, His Royal Majesty, Eze Cletus Ilomuanya, has asked security agencies in Imo State to hold former Governor Rochas Okorocha accountable for any breach of peace in the state. Eze Ilomuanya, who is the Obi of Obinugwu and the Chancellor of the Federal University, Birnin Kebbi, spoke to newsmen in his palace in Owerri, yesterday. He described the former governor’s statements, where he asked his supporters to defend themselves, as provocative and capable of inciting the people against the government. He condemned what he described as “reckless, the recent utterances of Okorocha and the threat he issued against the present administration.” According to him, “If it were under Okorocha’s tyrannical and intolerant administration, anybody who dared exhibit what he did would have been openly attacked by his crude thugs whom he always harboured.” While restating the position of Imo traditional rulers against “Okorocha’s recent open display of rascality and uncivilised utterances unbecoming of a former governor,” Eze Ilomuanya advised Okorocha that rather than engage in a show of irresponsibility, he should wait for the outcome of the panels set up to probe his administration. How will Okorocha fare in face-off with traditional rulers?
