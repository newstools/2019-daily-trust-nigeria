The Chairman of Abaji Area Council Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya has urged farmers and herdsmen in the area to continue living in peace. Ajiya, represented by secretary of the council, Alhaji Kamal Adamu Shuaibu, made the called while addressing farmers and herdsmen during a meeting at Gawu yesterday. He said there was the need for farmers and herdsmen to find peaceful means of settling disputes either from destruction of crops or attack on livestock, instead of resorting to violence. He said the council was disturbed that despite the committee inaugurated to foster peace among the farmers and herdsmen, some people are still bent in trying to scuttle the peace process by destroying farmlands. “Thank God the representatives of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria are here in this meeting, which I want to reiterate my administration’s determination to ensure that peace is sustained among our farmers and the Fulani herdsmen here in Gawu,” he said. The peace meeting also had representatives of various security agencies in the council.
