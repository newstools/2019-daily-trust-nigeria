A PDP governorship candidate and Member of the House of Representatives, Fred Agbedi, has dismissed as “untenable” claims by some politicians in Bayelsa State that the governorship position in 2019 be zoned to Bayelsa Central. Hon. Agbedi said there was never a time when elders, politicians and stakeholders sat to decide the issue of zoning or power rotation in Bayelsa State. Agbedi, who is representing Sagbama\Ekeremor Federal Constituency, said those advocating for zoning were ignorant of what they were calling for and that the state was not operated based on first and last born packages. Agbedi was speaking in Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital, when he led members of his Onward Restoration and Transformation Campaign Organisation to the secretariat of the Federated Correspondents Chapel of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ).
