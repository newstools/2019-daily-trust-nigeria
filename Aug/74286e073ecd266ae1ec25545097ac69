The National Conscience Party, NCP, has urged the Federal Government to do its best to speedily resolve all issues delaying the implementation of N30,000 minimum wage. The Lagos State Chairman of the party, Mr Fatai Ibuowo, gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos on Sunday. He said workers had endured enough hardship owing to the prevailing economic realities, saying that implementation of the new minimum wage would give them some succour. “We are appealing to the Federal Government to do its best to implement the N30,000 minimum wage. “Nigerian workers have faced a lot of hardship because of high costs of goods and services and so cannot wait to be paid the new wage. “We are aware that there are issues between labour and government on what to pay as increment to those on certain levels,’’ Ibuowo said. “We must emphasise that all categories of workers deserve substantial wage increments in view of the present economic realities,” he stressed. Ibuowo implored the government to arrive at a middle ground with labour and speedily implement the Minimum Wage Act, signed in April to better the lots of workers. He noted that, in a country where lawmakers earned what he called “astronomically-high wages and allowances’’, it was unfair not to pay workers a living wage. The NCP Chairman pointed out that the new N30,000 minimum wage, though better than the earlier N18,000, was still one of the lowest in the world.
