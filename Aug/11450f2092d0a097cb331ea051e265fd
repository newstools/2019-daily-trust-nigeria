The Buhari Media Organization (BMO) has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for tackling corrupt government appointees,  saying he has heralded a new era of morality in Nigeria’s social and political space. The organization in a statement signed by its Chairman Niyi Akinsiju and Secretary Cassidy Madueke, said that with the ongoing investigations of prominent public officers, including members of the ruling APC, the president had made the political space and public office “too hot for any allegations or scandals, whether from the past or present, on issues of corruption or any other malfeasance.” According to the statement, “Nigeria is getting its moral compass right, slowly but surely. There is the new template that the President Buhari administration has set for its public officials; that they must be above board, and that in the execution of their duties they must not be found wanting as mismanagement, malfeasance or misappropriation of state resources will attract severe repercussions. “He has also put the world on notice that the fight against corruption is not a selective fight. Its lenses and lights would flash at everyone whether friend or foe, whether party member or opposition, whether government official or businessman.”  Presidential tribunal: Buhari, Atiku groups trade words Buhari’s dilemma and its solution The anti-graft war must succeed Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
