The police in Ondo State said they have constituted a special team of investigators to hunt down a gang of armed robbers that attacked a bank in Iju, Akure local government area of the state, on Tuesday. The robbers killed a female staff member of the bank during the operation. The spokesman for the Ondo State police command, Femi Joseph, told Daily Trust yesterday that the Command had set up a special team to track the robbers and expressed optimism the bandits would soon be caught. The gang of six robbers, including a female that witnesses said was dressed in black, had stormed a branch of the bank in the town on the fateful day and forced their way into the strong room, killing a cleaner in the process. They were said to have carted away a huge sum of money. Joseph told Daily Trust yesterday that though the police were yet to arrest any of the robbers, the bandits would soon be in police net with the kind of extensive manhunt that the Command had launched. “They can only run but can’t hide”, he said.
