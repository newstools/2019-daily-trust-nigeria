The Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Team (DSVRT) says it is collaborating with religious institutions on the issue of domestic violence. To this end, the state, on Wednesday, organised a seminar at Sheraton Hotel, Ikeja, in partnership with the European Union-funded Rule of Law and Anti Collaboration Programme and the Nigeria Policing Programme, to sensitise religious organisations and ensure adequate response from them to complaints of sexual and gender-based violence. According to the DSVRT coordinator, Mrs Titilola Vivour-Adeniyi, the seminar was put together against the backdrop of recent statistics which revealed that 70 per cent of reported incidents of matrimonial abuses at DSVRT had already been reported at victims’ religious organisations.
