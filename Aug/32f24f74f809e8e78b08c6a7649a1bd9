As part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in Nigeria, Samsung Heavy Industries Nigeria (SHIN) has donated electrical equipment, clothing and other relief materials to the victims of herdsmen and Boko Haram’s attacks in Jos, Plateau State. SHI’s new gesture is coming less than one year after the Korean shipbuilding giant funded the cost of eye surgery for 102 Nigerian patients with cataracts. These patients who were at the risk of blindness successfully recovered their eyesight with Vision Care, an organisation under the World Health Organisation (WHO). In this latest gesture, SHIN said in a statement that a missionary group from Korea constructed school in Jos, for the villagers in Rhizha, where four missionaries are teaching about 560 children and also providing counselling to victims, mostly women, suffering from the trauma sustained from Boko Haram attacks.
