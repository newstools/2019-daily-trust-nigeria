The Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, says the Eighth National Assembly (NASS) frustrated the appointment of Mr Ibrahim Magu as substantive EFCC Chairman to cover the skeletons in their cupboards. The monarch said this yesterday while receiving a delegation of EFCC, Ibadan Zonal Office, in his palace. The delegation was led by the Head of the zonal office, Mr Friday Ebelo. “The Eighth National Assembly tried; they did everything possible not to get Magu appointed. Why? It was because they had skeletons in their cupboards,” he said. Adeyemi attested to the efficiency of EFCC under the leadership of Magu, adding that this is evident in the recent stories of recovered stolen funds in local and foreign currencies. He commended the commission on its efforts, saying it deserves the cooperation of all well-meaning Nigerians who desired a greater country. “We must encourage you; we must support you and cooperate with you; otherwise, corruption will kill Nigeria. “The fear of EFCC is leading some looters to several parts of the world. But you are after them. You are getting them. There is no hiding place for them. “Through you, I want to commend Ibrahim Magu for a job well done,” he said. Earlier, Ebelo told the monarch that the team’s visit was to solicit the support of the traditional institution in the anti-corruption campaign.
