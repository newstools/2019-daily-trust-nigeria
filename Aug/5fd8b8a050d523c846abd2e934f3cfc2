The secretary of Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), Rahmat Abisola Abdullahi, has urged international agencies and non-governmental organisations to support the best graduating student of University of Abuja, Talatu Adamu, to realise her dream of becoming an advocate for girl-child education. She said the graduate of Chemistry should be encouraged so that she could be an icon of excellence and role model to young girls in the territory and beyond. She said Talatu was determined to succeed despite being marginalised, adding that she should be supported to further her study and also absorbed into the educational system so that other children would look up to her. “If she is opportune to secure a job in the institution, people will see her and know that they can achieve greatness in life,” she said. She said she achieved the feat without attending any private school, adding that her success would show that people should still have hope in the public institutions. She said parents could also learn the need to educate their children regardless of societal beliefs as Talatu’s parent did.
