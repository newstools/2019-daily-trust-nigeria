The Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Kano, yesterday, adjourned its proceedings to September 18, for continuation of hearing shortly after the All Progressives Congress (APC) closed its defence after calling one witness. APC had on Friday, through its lead counsel, Alex Izinyon (SAN) applied for adjournment for them to prepare to call more witnesses, a motion that was granted and the tribunal adjourned to yesterday for continuation. However, counsel to APC, Prof. Mamman Yusufari (SAN), informed the court yesterday, that his client had decided to close its case as they did not intend to call more witnesses. Addressing the tribunal, the presiding judge, Justice Halima S. Muhammad, closed the case and advised counsels to all parties to get their final written addresses ready before September 18, so that they would be ready for adoption. Speaking to journalists, counsel to Governor Ganduje, Barrister Ibrahim Kaleel, explained that written addresses were summaries of facts, arguments and legal authorities in support of each party’s case based on its perception and the law.
