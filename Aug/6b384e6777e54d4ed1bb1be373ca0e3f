The National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole has said the party would win the presidential poll beyond 2023. Speaking on Friday in Abuja, when the APC governors met with the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party, Oshiomhole said the party may have internal challenges but that it would surmount them. Daily Trust gathered from reliable sources at the party’s national secretariat that the meeting was aimed at ironing out several issues affecting the party including the issue of litigations. Our correspondent also learnt that the closed-door meeting also initiated strategies aimed at campaigning vigourously and winning the November 16 governorship elections in Bayelsa and Kogi States. “As it stands, there are many cases in court.
