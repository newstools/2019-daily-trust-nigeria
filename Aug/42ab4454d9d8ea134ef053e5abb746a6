The Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Catherine Anene, told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Makurdi that the police were still investigating the circumstances surrounding the attack and its aftermath. Anene explained that four persons were killed at the burial of Tor Gbev Amaafu in Tongov while additional five were killed during reprisal attacks by Amaafu, Sati Agirigi and Ikurav Tiev communities.

An eyewitness told NAN that the gunmen, who numbered more than 10, opened fire on the mourners, killing and injuring several persons in the process. The gunmen attacked the mourners in the early hours of Saturday as a result of which four persons lost their lives on the spot while several others sustained severe injuries.
