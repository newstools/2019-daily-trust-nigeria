The President of the Northern Nigeria Conference of the Seventh Day Adventist Church, Pastor Yohanna Harry, has appealed to relevant authorities to scrap the conduct of elections on Saturdays which they regard as their Sabbath day. Pastor Harry told newsmen in Minna, Niger State, that the Federal Government had been infringing on their civic right to worship and participation in the electoral processes by fixing such events on their Sabbath day. He said, “Nigerians have the freedom of worship; they are supposed to be free to worship the way they want.
