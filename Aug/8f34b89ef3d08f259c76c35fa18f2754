Satisfying our customers is not rocket science. It is as simple as following the golden rule – treat others the way you want others to treat you. When you make policies, who do you have in mind? – Your business or customer. Some weeks ago, I ordered something online only to find out it did not fit. I called customer service to request a return. The help centre representative told me I have to bring the faulty item to the nearest centre. Meanwhile, I paid for delivery, and the company has riders coming to my estate every day. I informed them that it does not work for me, and if they insist on that policy with me, I will not shop with them again. Of course, the company grudgingly sent a rider to pick it up. Meanwhile, their competitors process refunds within 24 hours and pick up the faulty item within 48 hours. Some shops refuse to accept faulty merchandise or refuse to accept it after seven days, even when you have legitimate reasons to return late. Meanwhile, you find heartwarming videos online of foreign brands that go out of their way to put a smile on the face of their customer. Many businesses do not understand the concept of the lifetime value of a customer. They focus only on the transaction at hand and want to win at all cost. They forget that you can win the battle and lose the war. How does your customer feel after encountering you? Would they recommend your services to a friend afterwards?
