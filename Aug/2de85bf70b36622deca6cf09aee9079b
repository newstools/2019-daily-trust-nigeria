The Forum of PDP Professionals in Kogi has asked the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party to disqualify three aspirants who are from the same family but seeking the party’s ticket to contest the November 16 governorship election in the state. The group said this should be done before the party primary scheduled for next Tuesday. A letter to the National Secretary of the party, Alhaji Umar Tsauri,  which was signed by the  group’s Coordinator, Dr Temitope Atteh, said unless the three aspirants were pushed out of the race, the party would ultimately be defeated by the APC at the polls.

Dr Atteh lamented that the party’s stakeholders and elders were divided, stressing that the development was dangerous for the party.
