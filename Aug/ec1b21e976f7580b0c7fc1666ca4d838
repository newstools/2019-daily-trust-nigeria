Over 30,000 residents of Lokogoma District are at the risk of losing their properties to flood. The spokesman of Estates Residents in the district, Air Commodore Henry Ifezue (Rtd), made this known when he led a delegation of estates chairmen to Senator Philip Aduda yesterday. He said flooding in the area was caused by the dearth of infrastructure, adding that instead of demolition of houses, proper drainage and channelization of flood water should be provided. “There is no government presence in the area.  No central sewage channel, poor road network into the estate except internal roads done by the developers.  We, therefore, urge you to intervene by talking to the relevant authorities,” Ifezue said. He urged the senator representing FCT not to stop in using his office for the benefit of the residents, adding that he should intensify effort in addressing the plights of the residents. In his response, Aduda promised to work harder for the residents, adding that he would engage the government on the need for possible compensation for those whose houses were demolished. He said he had met with the FCT permanent secretary to proffer a lasting solution to the problem. “I will meet with the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, and  the Ecological Fund Office to discuss how to mitigate this flooding problem. We cannot afford to lose our people to flood,” he said.
