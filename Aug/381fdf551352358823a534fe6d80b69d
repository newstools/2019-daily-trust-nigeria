The immediate past Deputy Governor of Imo State, Prince Eze Madumere, has condemned the recent attack on a former Deputy Senate President, Chief Ike Ekweremadu, in Nuremberg, Germany, by some alleged IPOB members. Prince Madumere who spoke in Owerri, described the attack on Ekweremadu as embarrassing and uncalled for, saying that there were other ample means through which any misunderstood action or inaction could be addressed. He said instead of attacking Ekweremadu, the convention in Nuremberg should have served as a veritable platform to address whatever issue that might have been agitating their minds. He, therefore, advised that dialogue remained the best approach towards resolving any disagreement or conflict.
