The chairman of Daar Communications, owners of AIT and Raypower Radio, Chief Raymond Dokpesi, has said that many governors in Nigeria are running their states as private estates. He noted that many governors believed that governance was a personal affair and therefore did not bother to listen to popular views. Dokpesi therefore called on them to be transparent and become accessible to the media to avoid speculations or their actions being misinterpreted. Dokpesi, who frowned at “too much secrecy in government”, spoke in Calabar during the 2019 National Broadcast Summit with the theme ‘Broadcasting and Democracy – Emerging Security Imperatives’, organised by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC). “If you are passing a budget, it is only fit and proper for it to be debated in the state House of Assembly and the National Assembly,” he said. “The media should be fully involved and the people well educated because that will eliminate the possibility of rumour being disseminated. The governors would have removed the possibility of disinformation and misinformation that comes thereafter,” Dokpesi said. He also implored the social media, popularly called the new media, to be more responsible.
