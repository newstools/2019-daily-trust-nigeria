The Etsu of Kwali, Alhaji Shaban Audu Nizazo (III), has attributed insecurity across the country to the exclusion and undermining of the roles of traditional rulers by the Federal Government. Nizazo made the assertion at an event organised by the Directorate for Conflict Resolution and Inter-Faith Matters, an organ of the National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) in Kwali. “A situation where we are excluded both in the constitution and the general administration of the country, we are bound to face security challenge,” he added. Alhaji Nizazo, in a paper titled, ‘The Role of Traditional Rulers and Religious Leaders in Synergy with Political Leaders: A Veritable Tool for Good Governance and Violence-Free Society’, noted that every aspect of a community had a ruler, adding that a stranger would enter a town without the knowledge of a traditional ruler. Also speaking, the convener and Director, Conflict Resolution and Inter-Faith Matters, Ahmad Abubakar Sadiq, said the need to identify with vulnerable persons in the FCT and empower them was important to the development and harmony of the territory. City News reports that about 1,500 indigent primary school pupils across the six area councils were given writing materials and tuition fees during the event.
