Leading chemical solutions and oil and gas production engineering solutions group, Eunisell, has developed and launched two biodegradable cleaning solutions. Eunisell chemists spent almost two years in the laboratory, perfecting Nutresall 250 and Eunisoll SP 200, aimed at providing cleaning solutions for the Nigerian industrial and oil & gas sectors. Eunisoll SP 200 and Nutresall 250 are both designed to remove oily residues, stubborn stains and greasy grime from equipment, floors and machinery parts, so that dirt and emulsion can be quickly washed away, leaving a clean, residue-free surface. Eunisell is immensely proud that the product solutions are not only effective and cost-efficient, but in addition, are environmentally-friendly, abrasion-free and non-flammable. Customers can even wash their hands with the products – No harsh chemicals are used in manufacture, it said in a statement. The introduction of the two products forms only part of Eunisell’s commitment to embracing the local content drive of the Federal Government. The Group has already created numerous product solutions for the oil and gas and industrial sectors at the Eunisell Isolo Research and Development Laboratory.
