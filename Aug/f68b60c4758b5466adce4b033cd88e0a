Following the enrollment of tomato farmers into the Federal Government’s agricultural intervention under the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) tagged Anchor Brower, no fewer than 10,000 Kano state tomato farmers are set to benefit from the scheme. Speaking to newsmen in Kano,  state chairman of Tomato Out Growers Association of Nigeria (TOGAN) Alhaji Sani Danladi Yadakwari described the inclusion of tomato farmers in the FG’s agricultural intervention as one of the best positive developments for tomato farmers. He said TOGAN has taken measures to fish out fake farmers and ensure the scheme is a success. “We believe, by doing so we will checkmate the issue of farmers selling inputs collected. As you know, seedlings are very delicate and each goes for N8 per seedling thereby making it very vital not to waste time in planting. “However, we have succeeded in mapping out 10,000 tomato farmers that will benefit from the scheme. We have also set up a supervision team that will ensure compliance before first and second dosages of fertilizer and other chemicals will be given to beneficiaries,” he said. Yadakwari further revealed that with the development recorded in tomato production in the state which made it possible for tomato to be produced in the rainy season; the anchor borrower scheme has been kicked started and registered farmers will soon begin to receive their inputs.
