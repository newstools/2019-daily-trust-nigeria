A group under the aegis of Ane Igala Restoration (AIR) has appealed to the Federal Government to revive the Ajaokuta Steel Company  abandoned for years. The President and Convener of AIR, Mr Ocholi Ekpe Odekina made the call at the unveiling of Ane Igala Restoration with the theme: “we are stronger together”, at the weekend in Abuja. According to him, Ajaokuta is supposedly the largest steel industry in Africa yet Nigeria is not doing anything about it. He said: “We have iron; we have coal on that Niger Bridge. You will see hundreds of trailers loading coal out of our land. They dig hole every night and day yet my people are not benefiting from it. The environmental impact is huge, massive yet we don’t have light. For instance, we have Geregu that supply light/electricity to Abuja, yet Igalaland is in darkness. Is Nigerian fair to us?’’  We can make Ajaokuta Steel Plant a pride for Africa–Mr Quanli Ajaokuta  has so far  consumed  N658.8 bn  – Sole  Admin Why Ajaokuta Steel hasn’t started operation – FG Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
