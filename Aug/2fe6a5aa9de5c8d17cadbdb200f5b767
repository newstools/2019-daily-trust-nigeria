The Yobe State Election Petitions Tribunal in Abuja has fixed September 4 for judgment in the petition challenging the election of Senator Ibrahim Bomoi in Yobe South Senatorial District. Senator Mohammed Hassan of the PDP had asked the tribunal to nullify the election of Bomoi of the APC for non-compliance with the Electoral Act, 2010. Hassan, who polled 89,049 votes, alleged that Bomoi who got 118,729 votes was allocated invalid votes, adding that the said figures did not arise from the conduct of the February 23 senatorial election. Adopting his written address on Wednesday, counsel to Hassan, Paul Erokoro (SAN) stated that the lawful votes cast during the election were far below what the INEC declared for the election. According to Erokoro, findings showed that the lawful votes cast during the election placed his client (the petitioner) to scoring 37,429 votes as against 28,765 votes scored by the respondent. Erokoro stated that the 118,729 votes declared for the APC candidate against 89,049 declared for PDP candidate was not the true reflection of what transpired during voting. He urged the tribunal to declare his candidate as the true winner of the election due to the irregularities perceived in the 44 political wards, and 553 polling units scattered in the four local government areas of the senatorial district comprising Potiskum, Fika, Nangere, and Fune. But counsel to Bomoi, Kehinde Akinlolu (SAN) asked the tribunal to dismiss the petition as the petitioners failed to prove that his candidate won the election.
