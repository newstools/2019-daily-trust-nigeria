The Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN) says it will soon begin the implementation of the amended Act which has gotten the assent of President Muhammadu Buhari to tackle quackery in the profession. President of COREN, Engr Ali Rabiu, disclosed this when he received a delegation from the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) on a courtesy call in Abuja, yesterday. He said, “With the Act signed and ready for implementation, that challenge has been overcome. Our regulatory power base has been substantially broadened and we are now in a position to deal with anybody found wanting when it is fully implemented. “The modalities for implementation are being worked out to be presented to council at its September meeting and after ratification, council will go to work.” “I do not agree with those who say that professionals are too expensive and that is why they settle for quacks. Of course we have certified professional engineers on our register to be engaged affordably.” The Executive Secretary of FCDA, Engr Umar Gambo Jibrin, said FCDA as the core developer of the Abuja city, and COREN being the regulator of all the professionals in the engineering subsector, must partner to ensure that “the citizens understand our responsibility vis-a-vis what COREN does. And I think we have amply demonstrated that in our visit today.” The Director, Urban and Regional Planning at FCDA, Mrs Zahhau Ahmed, appealed to COREN to assist the FCDA and the Federal Government by ensuring that government policies concerning engineering are strictly adhered to. ...COREN seeks new legislations to curb trend COREN tries erring engineers Blame FG for incessant building collapse, says NATE Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
