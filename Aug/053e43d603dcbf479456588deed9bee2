A magistrate court in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State, has remanded a 41-year-old man, Samuel Olawale, in prison custody for alleged stealing, and breaking into a shop. Police prosecutor, Inspector Oriyomi Akinwale, informed the court that Olawale committed the offence on August 1, 2019, at about 2.30am at the Omisanja area of Ado-Ekiti. Akinwale said that the defendant, on the said date, unlawfully broke into the shop of one Amonaoko Emmanuel, and carted away one sewing machine valued at N7,500, one grinding machine costing N25,000, one grinding motor engine valued at N35,000 and one hand saw engine valued at N5,000. Inspector Akinwale told the court that he had duplicated the case file and forwarded it to the office of the Ekiti State Directorate of Public Prosecution for legal advice. Olawale’s plea was not taken as his lawyer, Mr Gboyega Ariyibi, sought for a date of adjournment pending advice from the DPP’s office. The magistrate, Timothy Abe, remanded the defendant in prison custody till the outcome of the legal advice and adjourned the case till September 16, 2019 for further hearing.
