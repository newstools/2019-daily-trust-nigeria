The Paris Trust Limited, a firm responsible for the collection of unremitted statutory allocation to the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) from oil and gas companies operating in the region, has said that the failure of the companies to pay their dues to the commission is impairing development in the region. The Principal Partner, Paris Trust Limited, Mr. Timothy Bagwams, told reporters yesterday in Abuja that the firm has been authorized by the NDDC to serve letters to the defaulting companies to remit their dues to the commission. “Section 14(2)(b) of the NDDC Act, 2014 says three percent of the total annual budget of any oil producing company operating on shore and off shore, in the Niger-Delta area,” Bagwams quoted the NDDC Act. “But as I speak with you the companies are owing NDDC more than N1.2 trillion, and this is why the Commission is achieving little in addressing the developmental needs of the region,” he added.
