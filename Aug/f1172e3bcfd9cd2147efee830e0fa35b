Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen has been named in the French Ligue 1 team of the week following his recent exploits for his club, Sporting Lille. The 20-year-old who joined Lille, on a five-year contract from the Belgian side Sporting Charleroi scored two goals against Nantes on Match Day 1. The former Under-17 World Cup winner will be looking to continue this impressive form throughout the season. “I was not under pressure, I was relaxed and the goals came. I just want to continue in that manner. I will not be carried away, I just want to do my best and to repay the club for having the confidence to spend such a huge amount of money to acquire me to the French League”, he said. Osimhen, a promising prospect for the Nigeria national team, put his team in front with a classy finish, before netting the winner ten minutes from full time to save Zeki Celik’s blushes. He took to social media to express his emotion after putting in a great shift at Stade Pierre Mauroy. “Debut win, goals, perfect start in Lille colour. God is the greatest, we move,” he said. He will be hoping to continue his impressive scoring form when Lille face Amiens at Stade de la Licorne on August 17.
