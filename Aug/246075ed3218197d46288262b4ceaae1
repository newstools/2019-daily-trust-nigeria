A Karmo Area Court Abuja, on Monday, ordered that a driver, Kalu Chukwu, who pleaded guilty to being in possession of a dangerous weapon, be remanded in prison custody pending sentencing. Chukwu of Gwarinpa, Abuja was arraigned on two counts of joint act and being in possession of dangerous weapon. The judge, Alhaji Inuwa Maiwada, adjourned the case until September 4, for sentencing. Earlier, the prosecution counsel, Ukagha Ijeoma, told the court that on August 8 Utako police got a distress call from the NNPC filling Station Wuse II. Ijeome said Chukwu, and one other, now at large, went to the filling station, bought fuel but refused to pay. She said when the defendant was arrested, the police recovered two cutlasses and one big iron rod from his Mazda 323 car. Ijeoma alleged that during police investigation and interrogation, the defendant could not give satisfactory account of his actions. The offence, she said, contravened sections 79 and 319(A) of the Penal Code.
