The Speaker of the Nasarawa State House of Assembly, Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe Abdullahi, has said that the APC will rule Nigeria beyond 2023 because President Muhammadu Buhari is laying a solid foundation for the party and the country at large. Rt. Hon. Abdullahi stated this at his country home in Umaisha while fielding questions from newsmen. He added that by the time President Buhari completed his eight years in 2023, he would have laid a solid foundation for the country and the party. He chided those predicting the death of APC by the time President Buhari completed his tenure. He said, “By the end of President Buhari’s tenure, I assure you he would have laid a solid foundation for the party, the country and whoever is coming will follow his footsteps. “Buhari is one person that will not like to impose anybody on Nigerians in 2023. We are going to assess individuals based on integrity so that whoever will wear Buhari’s shoes; we will go for him.” 2019 Presidency: Strong signals Buhari’ll run again 2019: Run and run, President Buhari, run ‘How Buhari’s ‘new’ gov’t should address Igbo concerns’ Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
