The ”Save Tiv in Taraba” Movement has given the governor of Taraba State, Darius Ishaku 30 days to resolve the crisis between the Tiv and Jukun ethnic groups in the state or face “judicial revolt” that could lead to his impeachment. Cordinator of the group, Timothy Tor Kyuga at a press conference in Kaduna said both the federal and the Taraba state government have not shown that they are willing to deal with the problem. He said so far the state government has not acted as a neutral arbiter, but has carried on like it is a party in the dispute by identifying with only one side.

There must be an end to the crisis in Taraba,” the group stated.
