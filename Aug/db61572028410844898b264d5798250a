The FCT permanent secretary, Chief Chinyeaka Oha’a, has flagged off the distribution of farm inputs to rural farmers affected by flood in Kuje Area Council. Oha’a said residents, especially farmers have been adversely affected by flooding and erosion in the territory for over two years. He said it was on that premise that the FCT Administration set up a joint a committee through the FCT Agricultural and Rural Development Secretariat and the FCT Emergency Management Agency to urgently address the problem. He said while the FCTA acknowledged that erosion and flooding were a natural phenomenon, it could also be triggered by unguided activities. “Findings have shown that farmers have engaged in activities without recourse to proper environmental assessment. Similarly, the arbitrary erection of structures by farmers has in most cases impeded free-flow of water resulting in  overflow of water channels,” he said. Also speaking, chairman of the council, Abdullahi Suleiman Sabo, said the flag-off of the distribution of farm inputs to farmers clearly showed there was no doubt that the council is the food basket of the FCT. He said the immediately on assumption of office, he purchased and distributed fertilisers to rural farmers free across the 10 wards, to ensure bumper harvest, adding that the council was also making more plans for rural farmers in the area.
