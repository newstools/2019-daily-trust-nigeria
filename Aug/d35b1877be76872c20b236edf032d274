The Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) of INEC in Cross River State, Mr. Briyai Frankland, has resigned his appointment to contest the Bayelsa State governorship race on the platform of APC. At a sendforth party held in his honour at INEC office in Calabar, Frankland said he conceded to pressure from his people to join the race. “On Saturday, 21 July, 2019, a mammoth crowd of meaningful and pragmatic Bayelsans that sincerely love their state held a very peaceful rally in Yenagoa, capital of Bayelsa State, calling my humble self to contest the November 16, gubernatorial election,” he said. “I have critically considered their demand…I have heard their call to selfless service that has always been my lifestyle. For the sake of the very important call to rescuing the kind, peace-loving and great people of Bayelsa State, I have resigned my appointment as REC in INEC with effect from Thursday, 8 August 2019. “As a progressive, I will identify with the very best of the progressive political party, the APC,” he said. He called on the people of Bayelsa State not to sell their votes but use them to vote wisely as there was dire need to change the political course of the state. Frankland said he would provide the very best alternative that would lift the people out of poverty.
