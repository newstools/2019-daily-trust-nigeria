He made the appeal on Saturday in his Eid-el-Kabir message issued by his Press Secretary, Mr Jibrin Gwamna, and made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Keffi. Abdullahi also urged Nigerians to pray for the country to overcome its current challenges for development to reign.

He emphasised the need for religious and traditional leaders to continue to preach peace, love and unity to their followers. Besides, Abdullahi called on Nigerians to shun all forms of sentiments, be tolerant and embrace one another for the betterment of the society.
