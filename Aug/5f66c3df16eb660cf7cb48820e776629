The Arewa Women Awareness Group (AWAG) has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to assign Dame Paulen Tallen as the Minister for Women Affairs. The group which commended President Muhammadu Buhari for appointing Tallen as a minister and the Senate for confirming her, said it was time the president complimented the good work by assigning Tallen to the Ministry of Women Affairs. AWAG in a statement by its National Coordinator, Murna Kande Bulama, said women in Nigeria stood to gain a lot by having Tallen as their minister. The group noted that Tallen had been in the forefront of the agitation for the improvement in the plight of women in Nigeria, saying she had been relentless in seeing to the betterment of rural women, especially in the North. AWAG said it “noted with delight and deep sense of appreciation” the role Tallen played in the alleviation of the suffering of women and her wide contact with both rural and urban women, saying it would be a great disappointment if she was not allowed to serve in the ministry she was passionate about. “She is one of the moving lights of the Jam’iyyar Matan Arewa (JMA) and has supported many women. Dame Tallen is our own; she is one person that understands our plight because she meets regularly and interfaces with a vast section of women in the country,” the group said.
