That is why we are calling on all the newly appointed ministers to work in the interest of Nigerians towards ensuring that the desire of President Buhari to improve on the living standard of Nigerians is actualized during their tenure in office as ministers. “If the ministers put in selfless efforts to ensure that they deliver effectively in their various ministries, I believe that the Next Level agenda of President Buhari will have positive impact on Nigerians.
