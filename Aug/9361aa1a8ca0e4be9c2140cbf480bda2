The Chairman of APC in Bayelsa State, Jonathan Amos Esq., has denied allegation by the PDP that his party is working to influence the decision of the election petitions tribunal in the state. Amos, while speaking with journalists in Yenagoa yesterday, explained that his party, the APC, won the two House of Representatives and a Senate’s seats squarely during the last general elections, saying there was no need to even think about lobbying the tribunal in the first place. He said the allegations by the PDP was baseless because APC won Southern Ijaw and Nembe/Brass Federal Constituencies squarely and fairly, hence, that there was no need to even think about subverting justice in the case as PDP did not even have evidence to proof. The PDP Chairman in the state, Mr. Moses Cleopas, had raised alarm that APC was working to influence the decision of the tribunal in the petition filed by its candidate and immediate past Speaker of the Bayelsa State House of Assembly, Mr. Konbowei Friday Benson, against his opponent from the APC, Mr. Preye Influence Oseke, who was declared winner of the election. Mr. Cleopas said, “The allegations from PDP are wild and unfounded as there are no such moves in the first place, and can never be; at least not from the APC. “These allegations are products of the PDP chairman’s imagination; perhaps hallucination,” he said.
