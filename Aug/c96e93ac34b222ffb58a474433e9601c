Members of the Abuja Newspaper Distributors Association have appealed for continued support of the management of Media Trust Limited in ensuring the success of its newly inaugurated executives. The distributors, led by their president, Benji Obute, while on a courtesy visit to the headquarters of Media Trust, publishers of the Trust titles, in Abuja, yesterday, said the support of the company would aid the success of the association’s new executive council members. “We appeal for continued support from your management as our current executives intend to drive the process of getting the FCT Administration to formalise our current location or allocate a new land for us to build our permanent headquarters,” Obute said. They commended Media Trust for supporting the activities of the association adding that they chose to visit the company first out of their respect for the company. They also requested for increase in the number of complimentary copies given to them. In his response, the General Manager, Business and Strategy, Ahmed Shekarau said Media Trust would assist them in the collaborative effort of disseminating information to readers.
