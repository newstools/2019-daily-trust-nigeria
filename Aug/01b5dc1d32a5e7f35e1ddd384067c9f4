A Mack truck yesterday morning rammed into a building at Ijaye, Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, killing a nine-year-old boy and injuring five occupants of the house who were said to be asleep when the incident occurred. The driver of the truck, registration number LND 754 XV, was said to have lost control of the wheels due to speeding and rammed into the house. The Public Relations Officer of the Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps (TRACE), Mr Babatunde Akinbiyi, confirmed the incident in a terse statement he sent to our correspondent in Abeokuta. According to Akinbiyi, the incident occurred about 3.46am on the Ijaye-Iyana Mortuary road due to over-speeding by the truck driver. “The truck was coming from the Iyana-Mortuary axis inbound Itoku when it suddenly lost control due to over-speeding, crossed the culvert and rammed into a shop and the house behind it,” he said. He explained that eight occupants, comprising one female adult, three female children, two male children and two male adults, were in the building when the truck rammed into it.
