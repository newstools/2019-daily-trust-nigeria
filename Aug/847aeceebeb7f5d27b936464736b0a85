Governor Yahaya Bello has assured the people of Kogi State of adequate security of lives and property ahead of the November 16, governorship election in the state. Gov. Bello who spoke to journalists yesterday after observing Eid-el-Kabir prayers at his Okene country home, urged politicians, aspirants and their supporters to go about their campaigns peacefully. He warned that whoever indulged in electoral violence before, during and after the election would be treated like “a common criminal.” The governor equally urged his supporters not to view those who indicated interest to contest in the election with him as having committed an “offence”, adding that democracy was all about giving people opportunity to make choice. He said, “Those challenging me in the forthcoming APC primary should be given an equal opportunity to contest. “As a responsible government, the security of lives and property is our priority and we will extend it to all aspirants.” He, therefore, cautioned some leaders in the country to desist from inciting the public against President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration, saying the president was doing his best and should be supported by all Nigerians to enable him succeed.
