Katsina State Governor Aminu Bello Masari has urged Nigerians to always put leaders in their prayers, and hold them accountable in a peaceful manner. Masari said this in a good will message to mark Eid El-Kabir, signed by the Director General, Media, Abdu Labaran Malumfashi. He observed that prayers, not confrontation, are what Nigerian leaders require to help them navigate the ship of state through the turbulence of security and social challenges besetting the nation. He said although it was within the right of citizens to request a fair deal from the government, it is counterproductive to allow the heart rule over the head by being confrontational in the approach. While calling on Muslims to imbibe the virtues of respect and obedience to the command of Allah, equality, love for one another, which the annual Pilgrimage seeks to teach, he stated that the last thing the country needed is disobedience to the Constitution, which prescribes legitimate methods of seeking the government’s attention. Governor Masari also took exception to ethnic profiling for criminal activities common on equal measure across the nation. He particularly called on the media not be too generous with its platform to “elements whose conversations are only tailored to widen our fault lines”, nothing that our diversity ought to be a source of strength.
