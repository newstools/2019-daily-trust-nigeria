The National Agricultural Seeds Council (NASC) has attributed the poor yield experienced by farmers to proliferations of adulterated seeds in the markets and lack of technical know-how on side of the farmers to identify genuine seeds from fake ones. This was disclosed by the NASC’s Director General (DG) Mr. Philips Olusegun Ojo during an educational sensitization meeting with farmers on quality specification of good seeds held in Kano. Represented during the event by NASC’s Seed Directorate Department Mr. Agboda A. Adebayo, the DG stated that a lot of farmers are being left at the mercy of seed vendors that usually adulterate seeds adding that the use of such seed is what is responsible to the poor yield being experienced by innocent farmers. The DG also revealed that, the council will ensure an effective use of the seed bill recently signed by President Buhari to tackle the issue and save farmers from preventable losses. “The seed bill signed into law on June 24 by President Muhammadu Buhari has indeed improved major critical areas in the farming industry and also the bill had given legal backing to the council to deal with issues of seed adulteration by people who were into faking of seeds,” he said. In his address, the Public Relation Officer of the Association of maize farmers of Nigeria Kano chapter, Malam Shuáibu Ahmed stated that, his association had already acquired certified seeds for distribution to its members as part of its internally adopted measures to boost its production.
