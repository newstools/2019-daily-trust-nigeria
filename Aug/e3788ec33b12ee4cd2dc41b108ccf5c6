A 24-year-old man, Donald Ume, might be jailed for 10 years if found guilty of defiling his neighbour’s two-year-old daughter. Ume, who an Ogba chief magistrate court, Lagos, had ordered to be remanded in prison custody, was dragged to court on a two-count charge of assault and defilement. The police alleged that the accused person committed the offence at Leo Ikeagwu Street, Ajao Estate, Lagos, where he was residing as a neighbour with the girl’s parents. The prosecutor, Edet Akadu, urged the court to severely penalise Ume to serve as deterrent to others who might be tempted to take undue advantage of female children. Akadu said that the accused person was caught in the act by some neighbours, who drew the attention of the girl’s mother to what had happened to her daughter. The prosecutor asked the court to refer the matter to the Lagos State Department of Public Prosecution for legal advice, since the girl is a minor. Chief Magistrate Mr K. O. Ogundare remanded Ume in prison custody without an option of bail. He directed the prosecutor to duplicate the file and send it to the DPP for advice. The matter was adjourned till October 9, 2019 pending advice from the DPP’s office.  2 men remanded for defiling minors Man risks 9-yr jail term for alleged defilement of 12-yr-old girl 45-year-old man in court for alleged defilement of friend’s six-year-old daughter Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
