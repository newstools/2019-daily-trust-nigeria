President Muhammadu Buhari has urged members of Bauchi and Edo state Houses of Assembly not to give up their rights and the rights of those who elected them. The President stated this when he received in audience, members of the Bauchi State House of Assembly and other stakeholders from the state at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. He charged them not to compromise on their individual integrity so as not to divide the House and the party. He advised them to stay firm, bearing in mind their responsibilities to their constituents and always keep the party in the state and at the centre informed. He, however, said that he will work with the relevant constitutional bodies to resolve the crises rocking the Houses of Assembly in Bauchi and Edo states. “I am aware of the problem in Edo and Bauchi states and I try to appreciate my position as the President, the political situation vis a vis the constitution of our country, the role of the commissioners of police and the party.  I always like to be on the side of the constitution,” he said. He promised to liaise with the Minister of Justice when sworn in, and the Inspector General of Police to ensure that the rights of the constituencies and individuals were not abused in any form.
