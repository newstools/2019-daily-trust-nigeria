Justice K.B Olawoyin of an Oyo State High Court on Monday freed and acquitted Chief Bisi Ilaka, the Chief of Staff to the state governor, Seyi Makinde, over a murder charge levelled against him by the state government in 2018. Justice Olawoyin also ordered the police to return to Ilaka his licensed firearm and other materials taken from him before the commencement of the trial. Ilaka, alongside with his security attaché, Temitayo Alamiyo, were standing trials over a pandemonium that broke out at the palace of the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, during Orayan festival on September 8, 2018, leading to the death of three persons. The Oyo Central senatorial district candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Alamiyo were remanded in Agodi prisons where they were held for 18 days before they were granted bail few days before the primary election for the election in which he emerged winner. Reacting to the judgement, Ilaka’s counsel, Abiodun Abdul-Raheem, said: “The Judge did a wonderful job, having combed all the pieces of evidence before the court vis-a-vis the requirements with regards to the charge against my client. Our law is further enriched by his immense decision.” Murder trial of Oyo senatorial aspirant, bodyguard moves to High Court Tribunal begins trial of ex-Oyo Speaker’s victory today You can’t sack us, council chairmen tell Oyo gov Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
