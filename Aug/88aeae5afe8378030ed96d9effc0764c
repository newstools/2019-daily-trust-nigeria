The Akwa Ibom Police Command has exonerated a staff of INEC, Mr Ejike Nwankwo, for the alleged possession of smart card readers. Nwankwo, an ICT staff of the commission, was arrested and detained for four days by the police for the alleged possession of four card readers during the 2019 general elections. However, investigation by the police on the issue exonerated Nwankwo and the commission from accusations by the APC which claimed that the INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner in the state, Mike Igini, made use of the commission’s staff to doctor the results of the 2019 elections in the state. According to a statement made available to journalists, yesterday in Uyo, INEC’s Public Affairs Officer, Mr Don Etukudo, said a police report had vindicated the staff in the matter and exonerated the commission. He advised the APC to avail itself of a copy of the police report as the commission had concluded the general elections and whatever was left of the exercise was at  various tribunals.
