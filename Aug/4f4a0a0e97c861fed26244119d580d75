Borno State Governor Babagana Zulum has launched Agro Rangers squad comprising the personnel of the Nigerian Security And Civil Defence Corps, Hunters, Vigilantes and the Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF). Kanem Trust reports that the setting up of the squad was aimed at ensuring  food security in the state and  providing security to the citizens. Zulum assured that his administration would ensure the strict compliance to its responsibilities. “Government has opened farmlands across all the major highways and shall safeguard the lands as well as the farmers,” he said. He said this was in addition to the support of farm inputs and financial incentives distributed to farmers. He added that the recent intimidation attempt by Boko Haram attacking towns and villages will not deter his administration’s resolve to find lasting peace and stability in the state. “This will rather strengthen our commitment and resilience until the state forces emerge victorious.’’ He promised that the government will provide an enabling environment to the Agro Rangers to perform their duties effectively. The Borno State Commandant of the NSCDC Abdullahi Ibrahim, said Agro Rangers is specialized operational squad saddled with the responsibility of providing security to farmlands as well as protection of investment in agriculture. He also stated that the rangers’ operation is limited to Maiduguri Metropolitan Council and Jere local government area for now but plans are under way to extend it to other liberated areas of the state.
