The Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi has appealed to the President of Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote to set up viable companies in Oyo kingdom, as he is doing across the country. The paramount ruler said this over the weekend during a meeting with the Management of Dangote Group in Lagos. He lauded Dangote for employing thousands of Nigerian Youth, noting that the nation will witness real growth and development when able youths are gainfully employed. Dangote assured the Alaafin of his readiness to bring investments to the ancient town by exploring the agricultural potentials of the area to help reduce youth unemployment and vulnerability of women. He promised to mandate the management of Aliko Dangote Foundation (ADF) to look into social welfare projects it could undertake for the benefit of the people of Oyo. Dangote said all hands should be on deck now more than ever before for job creation in view of the growing insecurity in the land saying joblessness is a major factor breeding criminal elements. He said: “If we must enjoy what we have, we must be secured. The security of lives and property is not that of government alone, we all have a part to play. The whole thing still has to do with adequate funding.” Earlier, the Alaafin had told his hosts that he came because of the concern for the growing youth unemployment in his domain in particular and the nation in general saying that he needed to be assisted to create jobs for the youths.
