Senators Abubakar Ahmad Moallahyidi and Binta Garba Masi are  set to approach the Appeal Court after the National Assembly Election Tribunal sitting in Yola, Adamawa State, dismissed their cases. Moallahyidi of the APC was challenging the election of Benos Yero of the PDP who was declared winner of the  Adamawa South Senatorial seat, while Masi  was challenging  the election of Elisha Abbo as senator representing Adamawa North Senatorial district. Justice Sulaiman Akanbi, in separate judgments in Yola, dismissed the cases on the ground that the applicants failed to prove their claims of irregularities and over voting.
