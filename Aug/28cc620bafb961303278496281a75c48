A socio-political organisation, FairWin Group, has called on the people of Kogi State to support the second term ambition of Governor Yahaya Bello to enable him consolidate his achievements in the state. Spokesman of the group and Special Adviser to the governor on Special Projects, Abdulkareem Onyekehi Suleiman, made the call after a solidarity walk in Lokoja. Suleiman, who doubles as the State Focal Person on National Social Investment Programme (NSIP), noted that the group’s philosophy was ideologically designed to support varying degrees of social, political and economic change in Kogi State. He, therefore, called on all well-meaning people of the state to support the “New Direction” government and the re-election of the governor, saying he had attracted “massive infrastructural developments” to the state. ”This historic procession is a solidarity for Gov. Yahaya Bello for his laudable achievements by FairWin Group, whose membership are drawn from the three senatorial districts of the State”. ”The governor has successfully broken the jinx of ethnic divides in the state, and the good people of Kogi State are now witnessing good governance in the critical areas of infrastructural development; the security of lives and property of the citizens is now guaranteed”, he said.
