An Abuja-based block maker, Emmanuel Boye, yesterday won a brand new car in the ongoing Dangote’s Bag of Goodies promo. A visibly excited Boye said Dangote Group had transformed his business positively with the car prize. “Sometime this year, I sold my Toyota Corolla in order to boost my business. My wife thought that was a crazy idea. But I used the proceeds from the car to stock Dangote cement for my block business. Look at me now, I am the proud owner of a brand new car, and my business is booming,’’ he said in Abuja after being presented with the car key. Speaking with journalists at the event, Dangote Group’s Group Executive Director, Engr Mansur Ahmed, said being the most successful cement brand in Africa, Dangote Cement decided to give back to its customers out of its profits. “Our success is first by the grace of Allah, and then by the patronage of loyal customers. So the Bag of Goodies promo is about giving back to our loyal customers so that they can share in our success story,” Engr Ahmed said. He said every customer is a winner and that they should keep on buying Dangote cement to also win. He said 43 cars, hundreds of tricycles, TVs, generators and other gifts would be won by all Dangote cement customers. Speaking early, the Marketing Director of Dangote Group, Mrs Funmi Sani, said the promo was put together to reward the company’s customers’ loyalty.
