The FCT Commissioner of Police, Bala Ciroma, has said the command will soon start clamping down on people that post fake news, especially on the social media in the territory. Ciroma said some social media handlers took delight in posting fake news to create unnecessary tension and panic among the people. “We have always carried thorough findings of happenings across the FCT, but some people, especially social media handlers are bent on posting fake news just to create unnecessary tension,” he said. He said since it was the duty of the police to protect the lives and property of every resident of the territory, they will never go out to tell lies, rather than investigate any information before it to a logical conclusion. “And I want to make it clear that when we get such people that engage in sending fake news outside, I believe the law shall take its course, “ he added. The CP attributed the success recorded in tackling cases of one-chance thieves and drug peddling to the motivation of police officers. The success was also as a result of the synergy between the police, other security agencies and members of the public, which, he said, adding that they have reduced cases of crime in the territory. Ciroma, therefore, urged members of the public to always support the police by giving useful information to them to checkmate activities of criminals in the FCT.
