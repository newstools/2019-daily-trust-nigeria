The Tinubu Transformation Agenda (TITAN) has endorsed Waziri Bulama for the position of National Secretary of the APC. In a statement yesterday, the National Publicity Secretary of the group, Dr. Muhammad Alkali, said Malam Bulama had all that were required to serve as the National Secretary of the APC. He said as a political movement, TITAN could vouch for Malam Bulama anywhere, describing him as “a man of dignity, honesty, transparency and above all, a party faithful. “To this note, the organisation calls on its teeming loyalists across the federation and beyond to support the candidature of Bulama, for easy realisation of the Next Level agenda and proper secretariat management of our party. “The organisation uses this medium to commend the 9th National Assembly under the leadership of His Excellency, Distinguished Sen. Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, for working closely with President Muhammadu Buhari which gave birth to a smooth screening, as well as confirmation of ministerial nominees sent by the president.” Buhari’s Taraba coordinator drums support for Bulama as APC scribe APC: Buhari group backs Bulama as Nat Sec Group endorses Bulama for APC national scribe Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
