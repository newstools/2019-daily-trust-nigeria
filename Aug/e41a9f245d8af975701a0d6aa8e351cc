PDP youths under the aegis of North East PDP Solidarity Group, have berated those plotting to destabilize the relationship between the party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar and PDP governors from the zone. The youths warned those in the habit of spreading fake news about the relationship between Atiku and the governors to steer clear. The group, in a statement by its chairman, Adamu Saidu, said the three governors, Bala Muhammed (Bauchi), Darius Ishaku (Taraba) and Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri (Adamawa) were solidly behind Atiku who is now at the Presidential Election Tribunal and will remain with him until the final judgment at the Supreme Court. The PDP group said the rumour that one of the governors was plotting to contest the 2023 presidential election and that was the reason why he refused to back Atiku at the tribunal was not true, adding that no governor was eyeing 2023. The statement said the governors were constantly in touch with Atiku, adding that the plot to put confusion in the midst of the PDP leaders would fail.
