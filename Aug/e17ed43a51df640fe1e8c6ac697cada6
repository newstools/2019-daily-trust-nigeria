The Ogun State governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, yesterday distributed relief materials to victims of flood disaster at Opako-Adigbe, Abeokuta. Represented by his Chief of Staff, Alhaji Shuaib Salisu, Abiodun said the distribution was necessary to fulfil his promise of providing succour to residents of the state. The governor revealed that the distribution of relief materials would be the first time it was being done by the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), saying that such a relief initiative had always been done by the federal government through the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA). Abiodun enjoined residents to avert a similar occurrence by planting trees and adhering strictly to other professional safety tips when putting up new and additional structures, adding that there was no amount of materials that could totally ameliorate their losses. The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of the Environment, Yetunde Dina, represented by the Director of Special Duties, Pastor Bola Orekoya, had earlier disclosed at the occasion that palliative measures being put in place were “a testimony of government’s commitment to the well-being of its citizens”. Dina advised the people of the state to adhere strictly to environmental laws to prevent recurrence. Materials distributed included bundles of roofing sheets, bags of cement, bags of rice, mattresses, mosquito nets, soaps and a variety of food items.
