Hearing will continue on September 16, 2019 in a case of fraudulent collection of N3.5 million the police levelled against a 62-year-old man, Emmanuel Amuda. The police alleged that Amuda obtained the money from a woman, Mrs Olubukola Oshikoya, on the pretence he had a property he would be selling to her. The prosecutor, Sergeant Friday Mameh, told the Igbosere magistrate court, Lagos, on Tuesday that Amuda committed the alleged three-count charge on February 6, 2018 and July 2, 2019 at No. 14, Taiwo Alade Close, Alagbado, Lagos. Mameh said the defendant obtained the sum of N3.5 million from Oshikoya on the pretence of selling a property situated at the above address to her, knowing his claim to be false. The prosecutor said when the complainant asked Amuda to refund the money after he could not fulfil his promise on the property, he issued her a Zenith Bank Plc cheque to the tune of N3.5m, which was dishonoured on presentation due to insufficient funds. The accused person is standing trial on a three-count charge of fraud, stealing and issuance of dud cheque. He pleaded not guilty to the charge preferred against him by the police. The magistrate, Mr B. I. Bakare, granted him N500,000 bail, with two sureties in like sum. Bakare said that the sureties must be gainfully employed and show evidence of tax payments to the Lagos State government.
