The Ship Owners Association of Nigeria, (SOAN) yesterday disclosed how the Federal Government was losing several billions of dollars as charges for the protection and indemnity of vessels plying the nation’s waters to foreign insurance firms. The charges collected by foreign  insurance firms which is known as “P&I” insurance, in London, goes out of the country as capital flight due to failure of Nigerian insurance companies to leave up to expectation, SOAN said. Speaking during a press conference organized by the association in Lagos, the Vice Chairman, Mr. Eno Williams stated that the issue of insurance for ship owners has always been a headache for ship owners in the country. “The Nigerian Insurance industry has not lived up to its expectation while rendering service. For instance, this ship you are seeing, the prototype here got burnt, but as we speak, this month would makes it five years this ship (Niger Delta king) has been down, in which it not so in London, they will simply just issue a credit note and the job would have been done within 6 to 8 month, but here it is going to five years now, and we are losing multi billion naira to the P&I insurance company in London,” Williams said. 2014: The year of challenges, opportunities in insurance sector ‘FG should stop foreign vessels from taking jobs in Nigeria’ Fire: Traders, insurance firms trade blame on non-insurance compliance Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
