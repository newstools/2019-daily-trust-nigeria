The Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), yesterday, called on the Federal Government to intervene in the dispute between the Cross River State government and Petroleum Tanker Drivers (PTDs) which has led to incessant strikes by the drivers in the state. MOMAN, in a statement signed by its national chairman, Adetunji Oyebanji, noted that the incessant crisis and disruption of loading activities at Calabar depot is affecting oil marketers’ business in the area. “The recurring issues are making it impossible to continue doing business in the area and is putting billions of Naira worth of investment and jobs in serious jeopardy,” he said He noted that since the crisis started a week ago, tanker drivers have not loaded. However, speaking with Daily Trust on the development, National Chairman of PTD, a branch of the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas workers (NUPENG), Otunba Salimon Akani Oladiti, said the drivers withdrew from the depot as a result of the state government’s action requesting tanker drivers to pay toll fee before loading at the depot. Oladiti also said no member of PTD would return to the depot until the state government withdrew its men from the area to allow peace to reign.
