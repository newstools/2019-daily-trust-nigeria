The Federal High Court sitting in Abeokuta, Ogun State, has convicted three accused persons for vandalizing an official patrol vehicle attached to Team ‘H’ Roving ‘A’ Anti-Smuggling Patrol, Ashipa forest, on September 22, 2017. The court found the accused persons – Yakubu Olamide, Paul Ayinla and Ayinde Adebayo – guilty jointly and separately, and sentenced them accordingly. The Customs Area Controller, Ogun State Command, Michael Agbara, disclosed this yesterday at the Idiroko border office of the command. Comptroller Agbara said, “While the Command is unrelenting in pursuing other cases, including the murder of one of its personnel (Hamisu Sani) on the January 6, 2019 with the major suspect involved in the case now in custody, this will serve as a deterrent to other unscrupulous members of the society who might harbour the intention of harassing security agents in the discharge of their lawful duties. “Moreover, a notorious smuggler based in Owode has been arrested and charged to a Federal High Court with smuggling of rice. He is in remand at the Ikoyi Prison pending the fulfilment of his bail conditions”. The Controller commended the sister agencies, opinion leaders, heads of traditional institutions, eminent personalities, the media and other law-abiding members of the public for their support to the Nigeria Customs Service in Ogun State.
