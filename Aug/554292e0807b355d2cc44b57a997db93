The Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Professor Akin Abayomi, has stated that the continuous implementation of the state government’s projects, interventions, policies and programmes on maternal and child survival is geared towards reduction of maternal and child mortality in the state. Abayomi, who spoke yesterday at an advocacy meeting with some stakeholders, community leaders and residents of Badore community in the Eti-Osa local government area of the state, noted that local and national statistics of maternal and child mortality and morbidity were of utmost concern to the state government, hence the adoption of various strategies to combat the scourge. “One of these strategies is the construction of a Maternal and Childcare Centre (MCC), which is a specialized healthcare centre for mothers and children aimed at taking maternal and child health care closer to the people by reducing travel time and  improving quality care to the highest possible standard,” he said. Abayomi, who was represented at the meeting by the Director of Projects in the Ministry of Health, Dr Olusoga Oduwole, disclosed that the state government had completed another MCC located on Ogombo Road, along Abraham Adesanya Estate, in Eti-Osa local government area as part of efforts to increase access of residents of the area to qualitative and efficient maternal and child health services. “The facility, which will commence operation soon, is a four-floor 110-bed complex designed to respond to maternal and child health issues by providing quality services for the restoration, improvement and promotion of the health and well-being of women, babies and children in the local government area and adjoining communities. “The facility has two theatres where surgeries could be done, consulting rooms, treatment rooms, ante-natal and post-natal wards, baby nursery, pharmacy, laboratory, and offices, among others,” he said.
