A former Vice President, Mohammed Namadi Sambo, has said he does not own or operate Facebook or any social media platform. Sambo, therefore, denied posting anything on social media, and described as “mischievous and unsolicited” posts made on Facebook and other social media accounts purportedly in his name. Sambo, in a statement he personally signed, said, “My attention has been drawn to unsolicited acts by some unscrupulous political jobbers that have sponsored and spread messages on Facebook and other social media platforms, purportedly conveying messages from my person. “I wish to make it public that the said messages are clearly the handiwork of mischief makers who are bent on creating confusion and disaffection to overheat the polity with the aim of achieving their selfish political motives and to bring my personality to disrepute. “For the avoidance of doubt, I do not own or operate any social media account on Facebook or any platform. For the record, the general public should note that I have never made any post, sponsored or asked anyone to do so on my behalf, directly or indirectly.” Ex Vice President Sambo disowns social media accounts EFCC nabs ‘facebook’ scammer; impersonates Okonjo-Iweala others I didn’t ask Buhari to step down – IBB Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
