The Director General of the FCT Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Alhaji Abbas Idris, has alerted Kuje and Kubwa residents of possible flooding. Idris, in a statement on Saturday, also urged residents of Gwagwa, Karmo, Airport road and Gwagwalada to be at alert. He said torrential rainfall had increased the water level at the Usuma Dam, which he said, the water spilled through Usuma River channel. He said people residing along Usuma Dam channel will experience an increase in the volume of water along the area. He said residents should be careful adding that flash flood develops quickly. The director general said, residents should listen to radio or television for necessary information as regards the flood situation. “And there is always the need for residents to always be aware that there could be possible flooding if there is any possibility of that in your area, we advise you to move quickly to the higher ground and do not wait for instructions to move,” he said. He also cautioned residents against walking through moving water, saying that six inches of moving water could make people fall. According to him, motorists are also advised not to drive into flooded water especially when floodwater rises around their areas, while urging vehicles owners to look for a safer area as they discover water level has increased. “Because if you do not do that, there is a possibility that such a vehicle and his owner may be swept away by the flood,” he added.
