Thomas made the commitment at the 2019 seminar for insurance correspondents held at the weekend in Ijebu Ode, Ogun state. Mr. Thomas who stood in for the Commissioner for Insurance said: “Our arms are open to welcome investors either into existing companies or new companies. What is important for us is an insurance industry that is solid and able to support the government in its initiatives; that it’s able to create employments by expanding, and at the end of it, it will add value to the economy.” He noted the recent recapitalization announced by NAICOM was aimed at building an industry that is resilient and capable of underwriting big risks in spite resistance from a section of the operators.
