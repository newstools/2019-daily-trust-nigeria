The Coalition of Progressive Political Parties (CPPP) in Bauchi has called on the House of Representatives to respect the high court order restraining it from taking over the state House of Assembly. Addressing a press conference, yesterday, in Bauchi, the chairman of the coalition, Musa Mato, said the threat by the National Assembly to take over the state House of Assembly was undemocratic as the matter was before a competent court of law. According to him, apart from the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP), other political parties in the state were in support of the 9th Assembly leadership which, he said, was inaugurated in accordance with the law. “The attention of the coalition was also drawn to the decision of the Federal House of Representatives that gave one month ultimatum for another inauguration of the Bauchi State 9th Assembly. “This is undemocratic exhibition by the federal lawmakers who are expected not only to make laws but to also respect the existing ones. “The state High Court had earlier given an order that restrains the federal lawmakers from taking any action regarding the inauguration of Bauchi State 9th assembly until after the determination of the court on the matter,” he said.
