The governors, in a statement yesterday by their chairman and Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi, said: “We wish to warn that should any southeast person be attacked anywhere in the world, we shall, by all means, bring back Kanu to Nigeria to face the wrath of our people.” They assured the people of the zone of protection against killer herdsmen.
