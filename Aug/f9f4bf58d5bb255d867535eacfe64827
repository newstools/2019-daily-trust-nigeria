Experts in the textile industry have identified revival of the moribund textile industry as the fastest way President Muhannadu Buhari can lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty. Alhaji Said Dattijo Adhama and Comrade Issa Aremu said this at a public lecture organised by the Kaduna state chapter of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR) in Kaduna. While Aremu called for creation of a ministry for the textile industry, Adhama said, even if the textile industry is revived to produce only pants, the industry with its long value chain would employ millions of Nigeria. Dattijo Adhama who is the Executive Chairman, Adhama Textiles and Garments Industry Ltd said, even with production of pants alone, the textile industry can turn around the economy of Nigeria. Adhama who was the Guest Speaker at the occasion said, with population size of 200 million, if three pairs of pants are produced for every Nigerian annually, it means, the textile will be producing 600 million pants annually. While commending President Buhari and Central Bank Governor, Godwin Emefiele for the policy to compel the military and paramilitary agencies to patronise made in Nigeria textile, Adhama said, the policy must be implemented to the latter. In his remarks, Comrade Aremu who is the General-Secretary of National Union of Textile Garments and Tailoring Workers Union said establishing a ministry for textile industry will fast-track its full revival to generate the desired job.
