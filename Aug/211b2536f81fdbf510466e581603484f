The Managing Director of the Nigerian Electricity Management Services Agency (NEMSA), Engr. Peter Ewesor has said the agency is creating a retraining scheme for certified electrical contractors, linesmen and professionals nationwide to enhance safety and zero accident in the power sector. Engr. Ewesor disclosed this on Monday when he received the new Director General of the National Power Training Institute of Nigeria (NAPTIN), Engr. Ahmed Nagode on a courtesy visit to NEMSA headquarters in Abuja. NEMSA certifies all electrical contractors, tests meters and the safety and technical standards enforcement umpire in the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI). Ewesor said while many electrical contractors and workers have been certified, they however need continuous training and retraining to promote safety and technical standards in the power sector. He said, “It is another ground that NEMSA and NAPTIN are breaking and we have started discussion with the Licenced Electrical contractors Association of Nigeria (LECAN) on that because they have a larger pool of electricians.” The NAPTIN DG said, “We have trained staff of NEMSA on two occasions and from the statement of the MD/CEO, the outcome has been good and that means we have met our objective. I must commend him because it’s only a good leader that will consider training and retraining for his staff.”   NEMSA trains 70 engineers on safe power networks NEMSA commissions N35m power testing equipment in Abuja NEMSA commissions N35m power testing equipment Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
