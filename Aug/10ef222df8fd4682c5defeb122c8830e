The Ekiti State Police Command has dragged a 27-year- old man, Adebayo Ayobami, before an Ado-Ekiti magistrate court for allegedly defrauding a trader using a fake bank transfer alert. The police prosecutor, Inspector Johnson Okunade, informed the court that Ayobami committed the offence between February and March this year at Ikere-Ekiti. According to Okunade, the defendant, within the said two months, fraudulently bought clothes and shoes worth N152,000 from the complainant, Wisdom John, with a fake bank transfer alert that purported the transaction to be successful. Ayobami was also accused of unlawfully buying a plasma television and a generator valued at the rate of N120,000 from one Victor Chijioke with a fake bank alert transfer. The police prosecutor also stated that the defendant fraudulently collected a cash sum of N110,000 from John and another person, Moses Damilola, through bank transfer alerts that were purportedly successful. Okunade added that Ayobami, on May 24, 2019 at Ado-Ekiti, also impersonated himself as an Army officer with intent to defraud people. The defendant pleaded not guilty. His lawyer, Mr Timileyin Omotosho, prayed the court to grant his client bail in liberal terms, adding he would not jump bail and would always make himself available in court when necessary. Chief Magistrate, Aderopo Adegboye, consequently granted Ayobami bail in the sum of N200,000 and two sureties in like sum and adjourned the case till September 27, 2019 for further hearing on the matter.
