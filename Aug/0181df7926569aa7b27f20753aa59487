Following the recent Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) directives to deposit money bank to ensure it attains a 60 percent loan to deposit ration by September 30th, Fidelity Bank plc says it is fully compliant already. The General Manager/Regional Bank Head, Ikeja Fidelity Bank PLC, ken Opara disclosed this while fielding questions from our reporter yesterday in Lagos. Opara said: “We are already above the LDR limit, so we don’t need to do any new lending to meet the limit. If you look at Fidelity in the last 5 years, every single year even during   the recession, we have always grown our loan book. “Even if you adjust for currency devaluations, we have always grown our loan book, so we are not affected by this minimum policy but that does not mean we are going to scale down.” He said Fidelity Bank adds value and also recognises the value of the MSMEs in the economy as the MSMEs are agents of growth in every economy around the world.
