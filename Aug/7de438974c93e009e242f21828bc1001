The monarch said the country must earmark special allocation for ICT education and training, in order for it not to miss out of the global digital revolution. While noting that youths in the country must be encouraged to take special interest in ICT, the Akarigbo added that private sector, particularly IT companies, must be collaborated with, to drive the country’s digital development.
