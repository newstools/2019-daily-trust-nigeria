The Niger State chapter of the All Progressives Congress APC has threatened mass exodus from the party over alleged lack of reward for loyalty through appointments. This was contained in the resolution of the expanded State Working Committee (SWC) meeting held at the APC secretariat in Minna. In the resolution which was signed by the publicity secretary, the APC expressed disappointment over Governor Abubakar Sani Bello who allegedly acted alone against the wish of the party members to favour a PDP member for ministerial appointment. Daily Trust reports that Amb. Zubairu Dada who had been screened and confirmed by the Senate is the ministerial nominee from Niger State. Amb. Dada had worked against the APC and its candidates in the last general elections, the SWC said in the resolution. It also observed with dismay that Amb. Dada and the senator representing Niger East Senatorial District, Mohammed Sani Musa were from the same local government area, ward and polling, saying the arrangement contravened the party’ The meeting attended by all the 25 local government party chairmen and secretaries called for the replacement of Amb. Dada, insisting that a loyal  party member who worked for its success should be picked. The party further resolved that “Since the same scenario played out in 2015 and was reversed, it is also fair that this should be reversed for justice and equity,” the party said.
