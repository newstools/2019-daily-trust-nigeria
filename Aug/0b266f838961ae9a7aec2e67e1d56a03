A man simply identified as Jude narrowly escaped lynching after he was caught allegedly attempting to rape a housewife in Anguwar Gede, Kuje Area Council, Abuja. A resident, Salisu Musa, said the suspect was caught in the woman’s room at about 3am last Thursday. He said some residents raised an alarm when they saw the suspect sneak into the woman’s room. The noise alerted some members of the vigilante group on patrol in the area. Musa said the suspect took flight on sighting members of the vigilante but was arrested by them. He said the arrest of the suspect attracted people who came with sticks and clubs rearing to beat him up. A member of the vigilante group, who preferred anonymity, said they had been on the lookout for the suspect for quite some time as he had been terrorising Sundaba residents. “The suspect goes at night to rape housewives, snatch their phones and other valuables but thank God he met his waterloo today,” he said. He said suspect engaged them in a scuffle while resisting arrest but some people latter came and joined them to make the arrest. He said the suspect, who sustained injury from the mob attack, was handed over to the police who took him to Kuje General Hospital for treatment. When contacted, however, spokesman of the FCT police command, DSP Anjuguri Manza, said they were  not aware of the incident.
