The Save Kwara Group (SKG), yesterday, lamented alleged marginalization of the North Central zone by the APC-led Federal Government in appointment to key positions. The group, which said it was at the forefront of the liberation struggle for the emancipation of Kwara State from the Saraki dynasty, added that the North Central zone voted massively for the government at the centre in the last general elections. Speaking during a press conference in Ilorin, SKG’s chairman, Mohammed Abioye said: “As you may be aware, recently there was a North Central zonal meeting of the APC in Abuja. A point was raised that generally the zone has been marginalized in the appointment to key positions by the Federal Government. The “President and Senate president are not from here. What we are saying is that the zone should be considered for some concessions in future appointments,” he said. On the performance of the Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq so far, Alhaji Abioye gave the governor pass-mark. He said, “60 or 70 days are too short to assess the performance of any governor; but I think the governor has done very well.” APC chieftain makes case for North Central Senate presidency: As Kwara intensifies push on Saraki The odds should favour Jos North Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
