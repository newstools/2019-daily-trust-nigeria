Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun has admonished Nigerians, particularly youths, to shun unholy and illegal means of getting rich. A statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Ismail Omipidan, on Sunday in Osogbo quoted Oyetola as giving the admonishment when he addressed some youths shortly after the Eid-el-Kabir prayers. The governor also warned the youths to abstain from acts capable of undermining their potentials to become great in life. He said youths could still get rich and be comfortable by engaging in legitimate businesses. Oyetola, who emphasised the need for youths to be hardworking so as to be productive, also urged them to shun social vices such cyber-crime, kidnapping and robbery among others. He advocated the need for youths to toe the path of greatness by striving hard to accomplish the visions and dreams of Nigeria’s founding fathers. “My advice to the youths is that they should have the fear of God, those that are in school should face their studies. “Those learning one vocation or the other are urged to remain committed and steadfast in their chosen fields. “The time is now for our youths to see their future as being important than their present, I implore them to face whatever they do and do it very well to excel in life.
