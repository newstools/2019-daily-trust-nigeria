Governor Matawalle alongside his deputy, Barrister Mahdi Aliyu Gusau, arrived at the venue of the event clad in typical Fulani attire, holding sticks. Top government functionaries were also in attendance. Dozens of local musicians trooped to the venue to entertain the guests.  The Fulani expressed confidence that the event would bond people and would be a turning point in the inter-ethnic relationship in the state. Speaking earlier, Governor Matawalle noted that the ongoing peace accord has so far given the Fulani in the state the confidence that the present administration is sincere in its resolve to uphold its own part of the bargain. “The Sharo festival is to ensure that every aggrieved party will forgive one another for a clean slate in Zamfara state. And I have much confidence that our initiative is paying off as our rural dwellers can testify to what I’m saying,” he noted.
