National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Adams Oshiomhole, yesterday, presented the financial report of the party to President Muhammadu Buhari. Oshiomhole presented the report to the president when he led members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party to the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Our correspondent reported that the presentation was made during the meeting held behind closed doors. At the end of the meeting, Oshiomhole told reporters that: “We also used the opportunity to present our financial report; what we spent on the election and what we spent in each state as a political party from monies that came from the treasury of our party. “Normally people think party funds are not to be accounted for but we are obliged to account for every kobo that was spent and who we spend it for and the result we have gotten,” he said. Asked how much was spent by the party on the 2019 elections, he said, “Because you are not a contributor, I am not obliged to account to you. I am accountable to APC members and unless you show me your membership card, I am not obliged to report to you. “The president is a very senior member of the APC and so he is entitled to know how much we spent; and as the steward of the party, I am entitled to present the report of my stewardship and cost we incurred in the cause of that stewardship,” he said.
