Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, yesterday, tendered an apology to the womenfolk for his inability to include many of them in his cabinet because of “intense pressure from various political stakeholders.” The governor disclosed that he had intention of appointing more women as commissioners and in first line commissions, boards and agencies but could not because of overwhelming pressures from gladiators and power brokers in the state. He, however, assured that in subsequently appointments, where he would exercise greater discretion, he would ensure the gender imbalance is redressed as the womenfolk played crucial role in elections. Governor Okowa, who swore in 25 commissioners with only one woman, also inaugurated the 15-man board of Delta State Oil Producing Areas Development Commission (DESOPADEC) without a single woman.
