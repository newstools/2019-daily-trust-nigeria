The National Power Training Institute of Nigeria (NAPTIN) has urged stakeholders to promote technical education and development in the power sector. It said this at a three day stakeholders’ Forum for Technical Education and Development in the Power Sector (TED2019) in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State. The NAPTIN organised event was themed, “The Role of Local Content and Legislative Support”. The Director General of NAPTIN, Mr Ahmed Bolaji Nagodem commended the Federal Government for providing financial support to NAPTIN under the French Development Agency (AFD) project to transform vocational skills in the power sector. He noted that the Ministerial Retreat initiated by the immediate past Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Mr Babatunde Raji Fashola was imperative to ensure synergy amongst Ministry, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) in the sector. Mr. Nagode also emphasized the importance of local content and legislative support and called for the patronage of NAPTIN as a Centre of Excellence in building human skills capacity in the power sector. He noted that local content capacity building will help to provide jobs for the teeming Nigerian youths and to growing the economy. The NAPTIN boss acknowledged the efforts of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), the Nigerian Electricity Management Services Agency (NEMSA) who collaborated with NAPTIN, to train a significant number of their staff.
