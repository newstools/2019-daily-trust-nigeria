The Chairman of Kwali Area Council, Mr. Danladi Bomboyi Chiya, has said if the youth are not properly engaged, they will become a liability to the society. Chiya stated this when he handed over appointment letters from the FCT Administration to some graduates indigenes of the council in his office yesterday. He said the youth were the backbone of any society, hence, his administration would ensure it engaged them. “Even during my electioneering campaign, I said the youth are the backbone of every society, hence, I will ensure they are given priority when I become the chairman. And today, I can say to God be the glory,” he said. The chairman, while congratulating the appointees, said he lobbied the appointment from the FCTA for his people who have been deprived of employment in the past to feel the impact of the dividends of democracy.
