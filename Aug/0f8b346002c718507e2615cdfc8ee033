The Inter-Party Advisory Council of Nigeria (IPAC) has launched the revised code of conduct for political parties in the country. Speaking yesterday at the event in collaboration with the Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room, the National Chairman of IPAC, Peter Ameh, said the revised 2019 code of conduct was necessary to prioritize areas that needed adequate attention in order to give it the international outlook required. He noted that the revised code of conduct would “bring about an IPAC which functions under properly set rules, under which member political parties can do their bits to grow a cohesive environment despite opposing views and ideologies.” He said the review committee made up of 29 members across all political parties in Nigeria came up with three new major principles to govern the council among other revised codes. The new document provided a new national gender policy adviser, a director for people living with disabilities, has given 35% where tenable to all women members and to all elective positions in  the council. On her part, Antonia Simbine, National Commissioner at the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) called on IPAC to ensure its objective contributes to sustainable development and democratic sustenance in the Nigerian polity whether at national or state level.
