The FCT Police Commissioner, Bala Ciroma, has refuted media report that an Igbo man was set ablaze in Abuja. Ciroma, in a statement by the command’s spokesman, DSP Anjuguri Manza, said the video being circulated by some persons on social media in which an Igbo man was set ablaze by alleged irate Muslim youths purportedly in Abuja was not true. He said discreet checks had been conducted by the police and no incident of such nature was recorded or reported. “It is also pertinent to add that the environment depicted in the circulating video does not represent any part of FCT,” he said. The police commissioner therefore urged members of the public to disregard and consider such video in circulation as misleading. The command reassured members of the public of its preparedness and commitment to the protection of lives and property and to forestall any act that could result in the breakdown of law and order in the Federal Capital Territory. He cautioned social media users to be mindful of information they circulate through their platforms.
