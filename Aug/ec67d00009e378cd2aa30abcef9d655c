Kogi State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has debunked claims that it has endorsed the aspirant of a party for the November 16 governorship election in the state. Its chairman in Kogi State, Dr John Ibenu, refuted the allegation at the CAN extraordinary extended exco meeting held, yesterday, at the Chapel of Freedom International in  Lokoja. There were rumour making the round in the social media that CAN in Kogi had endorsed Gov. Yahaya Bello, who is seeking re-election on the platform of the APC. Ibenu said the meeting was a “consultative plenary” meeting of all the five blocks of CAN to consider few important issues, and to make their position known to the public regarding the upcoming governorship election in the state. ‘’CAN is a spiritual and religious organisation and not a political organisation. All our members belong to as many political parties of their choice and they are free to do so. ‘’CAN is a father body to all political parties; and so cannot and should not adopt any political party in any election unless it is compelled to do so and that must be the decision of an emergency plenary,” he said. “CAN has not adopted any candidate; every member is encouraged to join the political party of their choice. CAN is open to all,’’ Ibenu said. He stressed that any political party that needed the support of CAN members must be committed to the fear of God; ensure peace and unity in the polity, justice, equity and fairness to all.
