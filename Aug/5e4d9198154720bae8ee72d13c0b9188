The Bureau of Public Service Reforms (BPSR) and the Digital Bridge Institute (DBI) have in Abuja signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on deepening the civil service reforms using the ICT. Speaking at the signing, the Director General of the BPSR, Mr. Dasuki Arabi, said the journey to the partnership between BPSR and DBI began on the 30th May when DBI while on a working visit to the Bureau presented its training bouquet and organization overview. According to him, the decision for partnership engagement became inevitable having established that up-skilling the capacity of public servants along current trend in technology is a vital catalyst for achieving a world class and rebranded public service for Nigeria in 2025, which resonates the vision of National Strategy for Public Service Reforms. He said the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) has been informed of the collaboration and that it is delightful that this would also be part of the agenda of the forthcoming meeting of Steering Committee on Reforms, for its broader advocacy and support. He also said that a Technical Working Committee drawn from BPSR and DBI were formed to put the MoU together and commended them for exhibiting commitment, teamwork and competencies in the development of the MoU. On her part, the Acting Administrator of DBI, Mrs. Viola Askia-Usoro, said the relevance of the ICT in driving the public service reforms cannot be over emphasized especially as the Federal Government seeks to redirect the public service information system.
