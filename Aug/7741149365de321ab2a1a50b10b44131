Parents have been urged to give children Islamic education for the proper worship of Allah and to make the society a better place to live in. The proprietor of Markaz Darul-Hijrah Education Research and Publication Centre, Malam Yakubu O. Dauda, made this known during the school’s second walimah and book launch ceremony in Bwari. “Islamic education has the efficacy of making children to be useful in this world and successful in the hereafter,” he said, adding that the school, within a short period, has about 90 students and pupils tutored in orthodox and qualitative Islamic education. “Despite the fact that our students and pupils combine Islamic education with the western one, they are still very much outstanding when they compete with others who receive only western education,” he said. Chairman of the occasion Alhaji Ibrahim Jubril said many children roamed the streets without good knowledge of the Qur’an. “There are many almajiris. Most of our almajiris do not study the Qur’an. They’re used to collect money lacking western and Islamic education. “It is a thing of joy for me to see students taking Islamic education important. Everything they know will aid their development in life especially at this age,” he said.
