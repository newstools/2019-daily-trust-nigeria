Senator Shehu Sani has said it will be unfair for the North to retain power beyond 2023. Sen. Sani who represented Kaduna Central in the 8th National Assembly said it would amount to an act of ungratefulness for the North to hold onto power after President Buhari’s tenure ended in 2023. He made the comment at the residence of a former Governor of the old Kaduna State, Balarabe Musa, during a Sallah homage. He also said President Buhari was able to clinch the highly coveted seat in 2015 and 2019 because of the support he got from other geo-political zones after failing on three consecutive occasions. Sen. Sani said, “My views on that (presidency) is very simple. It is an act of ingratitude for any northerner to think that by 2023, he or she should aspire for office in view of the fact that southerners, particularly the South West, did everything possible to support a northern candidate to emerge as the president in 2015. “It will amount to changing the rules of the game at half time when you are leading two zero. It can also be likened to removing the ladder after you have plucked the fruit.” He said the North should appreciate the support of progressive-minded nationalists from the South West or the South in general who worked tirelessly to remove the PDP out of power in 2015. He, however, warned that the North must put its house in order and address the problem of majority versus minority tribes in the region in order to make sustainable progress.
