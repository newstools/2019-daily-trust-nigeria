Witnesses said the suspect was about to be set ablaze before some police officers intervened. A witness said the owner of the motorcycle had parked it outside a bank at about 10am. “When the man came out of the bank and could not find his motorcycle. He alerted some members of the motorcycle union. They went after the suspect and caught close to the Gwagwalada Bridge. They beat him to stupor,” he said. He said some people later came around with tyres and petrol and almost set the suspect ablaze until some policemen came to his rescue. When contacted, the Gwagwalada Divisional Police Officer (DPO) CSP Wilson Dankwano said the suspect was in police custody. He said the suspect would be prosecuted adding that members of the motorcycle union should set up a task force monitoring their motorcycles in the area. “The major problem we have is about this motorcycle theft and I want to advise that the motorcycle riders union set  up a vigilante group among themselves just like the way Yoruba community did,” he said.
