The Chairman of Bwari Area Council, Mr. John Gabaya, has distributed 1,200 bags of fertiliser to some rural farmers in the council. Gabaya, who spoke during the flag-off of the distribution, on Friday, said the gesture was to boost harvest during the farming season. He also said it was aimed at alleviating poverty and the suffering of the people of the area, adding that his administration was determined to give priority to agriculture by providing farm inputs to farmers in the area. The chairman said the free distribution of 1,200 bags of fertiliser cut across the 10 wards of the council. He cautioned farmers not to allow middlemen who try to convince them to sell their shares to them high jack the commodity. City News reports that the chairman also distributed sewing machines and motorcycles to women and youth groups in the area.
