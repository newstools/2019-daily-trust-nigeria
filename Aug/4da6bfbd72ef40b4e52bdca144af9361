Ahead of the September 3 governorship primary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Bayelsa State, one of the contenders, Mr Fred Agbedi, has sought God’s face to ensure his victory. Agbedi, a former chairman of the party in the state and currently representing Sagbama/Ekeremor Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, led his supporters, yesterday, to the Assemblies of God Church, Onopa, in Yenagoa Local Government Area of the state where he also appreciated God for successful consultations. Agbedi, who tagged his campaign ‘The Onward Restoration and Transformation Campaign Organization’, thanked the church for standing with his team throughout the consultations period. He said: “God has intervened massively in our consultations. He has led us well and we have gone round the eight local government areas of Bayelsa State consulting our party men and women. “Though, there were some temptations, most especially when the entourage of our campaign director general was involved in an accident, God protect everybody on the entourage,” he said. “Despite all these minor incidents, God still gave us a successful outing. Since God has stood with us this far, we are confident that he is leading us to victory come September 3, 2019,” he said.
