A statement by the command’s spokesman, DSP Anjuguri Manza, said the suspect was arrested following an ongoing investigation by operatives of the command’s Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). He said the suspect was an armourer of a vicious armed robbery syndicate that was notorious for raping its female victims during robbery operations. He said the suspect, who has been on the run following the arrest of some members of his gang in 2018, was arrested at his hideout in Byazhin, Kubwa. “The suspect will be arraigned in court upon conclusion of the investigation,” he said.
