Yusuf Ishak, who took the ransom money demanded for the release of an abducted health worker in Kaduna, yesterday narrated how he was also abducted by the kidnappers after delivering the ransom money. Ishak said he took the ransom money to a forest called Doguwa to secure the release of a health worker, Abdulrashid Lawal (popularly known as “Dr Prince”), who was kidnapped a week ago at Rigasa community, a suburb of Igabi Local Government of Kaduna state. “We were released around 12pm yesterday (Monday) together with Abdulrashid Lawal after I took the ransom to the kidnappers in the bush because they agreed to collect N350,000. But unfortunately, after I delivered the ransom, I was hit from behind by one of the kidnappers”, Rigasa told our reporter. “They tied and blindfolded me. I spent four days with them inside the forest in that condition before we were released after an additional of N300,000 was paid to them,” he said. On why he was held hostage, Ishak said, “They said the ransom I took to them was not the initial agreement Lawal’s family agreed with them. So, they held me hostage too and maltreated me badly.” “Honestly, I never knew we will come back alive due to the suffering we went through in the hands of those people. We ate with our eyes closed throughout my stay with them. As we speak now myself and Abdulrashid are undergoing treatment,” he added. Daily Trust reports that Lawal and Ishak are teachers at a private health school called Sardauna Memorial Medical Foundation along Lakwaja Road, Rigasa in Kaduna State.
