The Chief Executive Officer of Galaxy Transportation and Construction Services Limited, Babagana Dalori, has commenced payment process of about 393 clients owed by the company. In a statement signed by the companyâ€™s media consultant, Abdulhamid Ibrahim, Dalori however stated that the payment will be done in batches. The payments are coming few months after the company, which is involved in sand-mining and quarry operations, stopped due to floods at its sites in Jere, Kaduna State and Mpape FCT. Dalori, who was granted bail by a Federal High Court in Abuja following his detention by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over alleged fraud, was re-arrested by the anti-graft agency in July. Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu had also restrained the EFCC from taking any step which would be inimical to the guaranteed fundamental rights of Dalori as provided under sections 35 and 41 of the 1999 Constitution. Justice Ojukwu ruled alternatively that the EFCC should arraign Dalori in any court of competent jurisdiction over the alleged offences. Dalori was arrested on March 29 over allegations of collecting the sum of N7 billion from 20, 700 investors in the transport company in the North East. But the spokesman of the company said the detention of Dalori contributed to the major setback suffered by the company in the payment to clients.
