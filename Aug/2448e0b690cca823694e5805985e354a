An Abuja-based school for children with disability like autism, down syndrome and cerebral palsy, Royal School of Education Therapy Foundation (RSETF), says it has concluded plans to offer free health services to residents. A press statement issued by the founder of the foundation, Dr. Badewa Adejugbe-Williams, stated that the event has been scheduled to hold on Saturday in Garki. The statement also said the project, which is funded by Royal School of Educational Therapy Foundation and Brain and Spine Surgery Consortium, will offer free check-up by doctors, adding that free food will also be served during the fair. She also called on parents and guardians not to see down syndrome as a disease, stressing that people living with it are just like everyone else, noting such children are capable of independent functions and participation in society. The educational therapist assured that Royal School of Educational Therapy Foundation is poised to raise awareness about the most common genetic condition known as down syndrome, and called for support from all stakeholders. Adejugbe-Williams also frowned at stigmatization of children with learning disabilities in the society who are often abandoned by their parents, instead of giving them the opportunities to develop their talents for the advantage of society.
