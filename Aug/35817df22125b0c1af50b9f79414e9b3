A non-governmental organisation (NGO), Bountiis Charity, has as part of its entrepreneurship empowerment programme trained 40 Muslim women on mini-food exportation business in Lagos. The training was designed to support striving entrepreneurs, particularly women to enhance alternative revenue generation. The Chairperson of Bountiis Board of Trustees, Mrs. Falilat Jimoh, in her welcome address, stated that the organisation aspires to empower Muslim women to become enlightened, successful and thrive as individuals and members of the Muslim community. Speaking at one of the training sessions, an international trade consultant, Matti AbdulFatai, discussed large exportation business and explained the processes, documents as well as how exporters can connect with foreign customers. Matti also explained the dynamic nature of international trade and how to succeed in exportation business. He called on government to address logistics problems in agro-commodity business as well as put measures in place to make it profitable for farmers by serving as off-takers to coordinate pricing of commodities.
