The Congress of Kwara Youths, an umbrella body of youth associations across the state, yesterday, called for the removal of the Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state, Bashiru Bolarinwa. Speaking to journalists shortly after an emergency meeting held in Ilorin, the spokesman of the group, Mr. Ishaq Ibrahim, who read their resolutions, gave the party seven days’ ultimatum to remove  Bolarinwa from office. Ibrahim, who is also the Coordinator of Ilorin Emirate Youths Assembly, noted that, “We have carefully watched the trend of political happenings in the state in the last few days and we hereby lend our voice to corroborate the position of other stakeholders in the state who have earlier called for the party chairman’s removal. “Hon. Bolarinwa’s greed, and disloyal attitude to Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq doesn’t portray him as a true party helmsman that is expected to foster prudence, peace, unity and prosperity among members. “We hereby urge the APC national leadership to urgently remove Hon. Bolarinwa and allow an experienced party man from Kwara North to replace him. Failure to heed to our demand will lead to total takeover and shutdown of the APC secretariat by our members,” he said. But Bolarinwa in his reaction said the group was faceless and did not have any link with the party. “Let me also add that there is nothing the state government is doing that the party and I have not been supporting. I have always been with the governor in all his programmes,” he said.
