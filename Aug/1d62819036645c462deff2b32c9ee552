The Deputy Speaker of the Katsina State House of Assembly, Shehu Dalhatu Tafoki, has berated the #RevolutionNow advocates and described their action as insincere in the quest for an enduring democracy in the country. In a statement issued in Katsina, Hon. Tafoki said calling for revolution was not right for a nation that was developing fast. He said, “Those calling for revolution are insincere; they want to gain cheap publicity in a crude and unpopular manner. I am happy that Nigerians know better and have done what is expected by ignoring the call.” He added that Nigeria had gotten the best under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, and that what was required from well-meaning citizens was understanding and support towards the establishment of an egalitarian nation.
