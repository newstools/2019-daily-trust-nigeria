The Senate says it wants a robust power sector road map that will include the generation, transmission and distribution segments in a holistic picture on how to resolve power supply challenges. The Managing Director/CEO, Mr. Usman Gur Mohammed, who disclosed this at a quarterly press conference in Abuja, said that was aimed at further expanding and stabilizing the grid. A statement by TCN said the Senate also declared its support for the proposal to recapitalise the Distribution Companies (DisCos). It advised that the 40 per cent holding of the Federal Government as stipulated in the Power Privatisation Act 2005 might be more beneficial if it was sold to foreign investors with technical know-how. Senate President Ahmad Lawan, who revealed these when he received the TCN management team in his office, recently at the National Assembly Complex in Abuja, assured that the Senate would support its Transmission Rehabilitation and Expansion Programme (TREP) with the objective of rehabilitating, stabilizing and providing necessary flexibility in the transmission grid. He however expressed displeasure with the report on Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) contracts awarded three times in the past without success and called for a more stringent process that would allow only qualified firms to execute the project.
