The PDP in Sokoto State has closed its defence at the governorship election tribunal without calling any witness to speak on the petition filed by the APC and its gubernatorial candidate, Alhaji Ahmed Aliyu Sokoto. PDP, which is the 3rd respondent, was to open its defence yesterday but when the case came up, its counsel, N. A. Idako, told the tribunal that “we do not intend to lead any evidence.” According to him, “We shall be relying on the case of the 2nd respondent (Governor Aminu Tambuwal) as well as evidences extracted from the cross examination of the petitioners’ witnesses.” Governor Tambuwal had presented eight witnesses while the petitioners called 10 at the tribunal. It would be recalled that INEC, which is the 1st respondent, also did not present any witness. Lawyers of the electoral empire had, during the July 23 sitting of the tribunal, said they had reviewed the petition and the witnesses called by the petitioners, saying they would also rely on the evidences they extracted from the cross examination of the witnesses of the petitioners. Chairman of the tribunal, Justice Abdullahi Bawale, adjourned the case to September 3 for the adoption of written addresses.
