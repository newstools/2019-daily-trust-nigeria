Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State has called for the resuscitation of Warri Port, regarded as a key factor to the economic development of the state and nation. The governor spoke when the Olu of Warri, Ogiame Ikenwoli I, visited him in Asaba on Wednesday. Okowa observed that with the congestion of the Lagos ports, the Federal Government should revive Warri Port and other sea ports to boost the nation’s economy. “There is no doubt that the Warri port is a key economic factor for our state and the nation; the earlier we get it working the better for us. “It is in the best interest of this nation to expand, create and develop port facilities because, Lagos ports are already congested and more ports mean more boost to our economy,” he said. Okowa informed the Itsekiri monarch of his administration’s commitment to the yearnings of the people through projects that impact positively on them. Earlier, the monarch had congratulated the governor on his electoral victory and thanked him for the appointments given to Itsekiri sons and daughters in his administration. He assured the governor that he would ensure that peace reigned in Itsekiri kingdom to engender development. Gov.
