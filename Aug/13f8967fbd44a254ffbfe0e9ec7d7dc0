Counsels representing Gov. Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State at the election petitions tribunal sitting in Lafia have urged the judges to dismiss the petition filed by PDP’s David Ombugadu for lack of merit. Chief Wole Olanipekun (SAN) who is the lead counsel to Gov. Sule, urged the tribunal to quash the petition while adopting his final written address on Monday. Olanipekun said this was because the petition lacked merit and substance in every aspect. While adopting his final written address, he asked the court to dismiss the petition challenging the election of Gov. Sule during the March 9 general elections. Responding, lead Counsel to the petitioner, Mr. Chibuike Nwokeukwu, while also adopting his final written address, argued that Gov. Sule was not duly elected by the majority of lawful votes cast.
