Mr Richard-Mark Mbaram, Managing Director, AgroNigeria, says that the Federal Government’s suggestion to divert forex to other profitable economic activities will provide protection for local producers of agro commodities. Mbaram made the assertion while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Lagos against the backdrop of the Federal Government’s suggestion to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to stop forex to food importers. He said the most striking implication was that it was a positive move to create hurdles on the part of food and agro commodity importers. “There are particularly wide ranging implications for agricultural productivity and development where the government decides to go tough on importation leveraging monetary policy tools at its disposal. He, however, called for more secure land borders as well as the entrenched corruption in the system through which these products find their way into the country to compromise the good intentions of government.
