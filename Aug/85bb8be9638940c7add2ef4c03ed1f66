I have critically considered their demand and dilemma. I have heard their call to selfless service that had always being my lifestyle. For the sake of the very important call to rescuing the kind, peace loving and great people of Bayelsa State. I have resigned my appointment as a REC in the INEC with effect from Thursday, 8 August 2019.” “As a Progressive, I will identify with the very best of the progressive political parties, the APC.” He called on the people of Bayelsa State not to sell their votes but vote wisely as there was a dire need to change the political course of the state.
