The corpse of a three-year-old boy has been found in a well in Auguwar Abattoir area of Abaji Area Council. Residents could not explain how the boy got inside the well but said he was last seen playing with his mates while his mother was breaking a log of wood around the house. A resident who identified himself as Ibrahim said the incident happened on Wednesday, adding that the well was newly dug by their neighbour in his house to meet their water needs. “When the mother finished breaking the firewood, she started looking for her son and could not find him. One of the boys he was playing with, pointed at the well behind her neighbours house and found a stick the boy had carried by the side, “ he said He said the mother’s suspicion was heightened after finding the stick beside the well. Ibrahim said she immediately raised an alarm which attracted neighbours to the scene. “One of the neighbours entered the well and brought out the boy. He was rushed to hospital where he was confirmed dead. When contacted, the Abaji Divisional Police Officer (DPO), Umar Musa, said he was not aware of the incident, as it was not reported to the police. “I am just hearing about the incident from you, as nobody came to report such an incident, I will find out from my men,” he said.
