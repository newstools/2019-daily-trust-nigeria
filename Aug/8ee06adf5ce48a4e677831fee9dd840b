A Federal High Court in Abuja has ordered both the Senate and the House of Representatives to halt their plan to take over the legislative duties of  Edo State House of Assembly. Justice Taiwo Taiwo, yesterday, ordered parties to maintain the status quo pending the determination of the case. This followed resumed hearing in the case instituted by the Edo State Government to challenge the directive by the chambers of the National Assembly directing Governor Godwin Obaseki to issue a fresh proclamation of the state’s House of Assembly. The National Assembly threatened to take over the legislative duties and powers of the Edo State House of Assembly should the governor fail to make the fresh proclamation within three weeks. Before adjourning the suit to August 22 for hearing, the court gave the Clerk of the National Assembly and the National Assembly seven days to respond to the issues raised in the Edo State Government’s suit. Contracted, the spokesperson of the Senate, Sen. Adeyeye Adedayo said since the Senate is on recess, no action will be taken on the matter. “Whether the Senate agrees or not, that will be known when we resume from our recess. Senate decisions/resolutions are taken collectively,” he said in a phone interview last night.
