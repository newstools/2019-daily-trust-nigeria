The FCT chapter of the National Commercial Tricycle and Motorcycle Owners and Riders Association (NACTOMORAS) has launched an e-public security solution application. The application was launched during a three-day training organised by the association on operational safety in Abuja, yesterday. The FCT chairman of NACTOMORAS, Comrade  Musa Ibrahim, said the need to educate and sensitise its members on security techniques and e-public security solutions became necessary due to the security challenges in the country. “Our challenges with the authorities of the FCT and criticism about the conduct of some of our operators have given us cause for concern. That has forced us to think outside the box. Because of this, the need to train our operators on basic road usage and security awareness has become inevitable,” Ibrahim said. He said with the new e-public security solution app which will be installed in the telephone of the tricycle operators, they will be able to track over 5000 operators in the FCT. The CEO of Vivid Security Solution, initiators of the app, Ikem Michael Uche, said the e-public safety app, which won the Tony Elumelu Foundation grant in 2018, has helped in dealing with security issues. His Royal Highness, the Chief of Garki, Alhaji (Dr.) Usman Ndakupi, who flagged off the training urged the tricycle operators to desist from taking drugs and be security conscious as they carry out their daily business.
