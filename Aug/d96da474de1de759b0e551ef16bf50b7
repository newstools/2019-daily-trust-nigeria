The Lagos State Muslim Pilgrims’ Welfare Board (LSMPWB) has confirmed the death of one of its pilgrims. The female pilgrim, identified as Lawal Mulikat Shade, 56, was a native of Ikirun, Osun State, who came to Hajj through the Oshodi-Isolo Local Council Development Area with passport number A09878948. A statement from the Public Affairs Unit of the Board disclosed that two pilgrims slumped after carrying out the first round of the symbolic stoning of the devil at Jamarat on Sunday. The pebble-throwing session is one of the important rites of Hajj. Two Lagos pilgrims reportedly slumped during the session, while the other was rescued, the statement revealed. Shade, however, gave up before getting to the hospital, it was stated. According to the statement, the medical report on the pilgrim indicated that she was an hypertensive patient. The Amir Hajj of the state, Dr Abdul-Hakeem Abdul-Lateef, said the Board was working with the Saudi Arabian authorities and the family of the deceased for burial arrangements at Masjid Al Haram, Mecca. Praying for the repose of the deceased, the Amirul Hajj cautioned other pilgrims incapacitated due to health challenges to send other pilgrims to do the stoning on their behalf. Six Nigerian pilgrims had died since the beginning of this year’s Hajj. Meanwhile, Lagos pilgrims successfully performed the throwing of the pebbles to Jamarat Al-Aqaba in Mina.
