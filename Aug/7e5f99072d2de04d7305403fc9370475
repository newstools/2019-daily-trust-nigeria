The Chief Judge of Ekiti State, Justice Ayodeji Daramola, has sentenced two persons to death by hanging for robbery and illegal possession of firearms. The two persons, Adewa Sunday and Adedayo Amos, were arraigned in court for robbing Mrs Abosede Oyeyemi Malomo at Ilogbo-Ekiti in Ido/Osi Local Government, Ekiti State, at night on June 4, 2015. The two men were said to have robbed Mrs Malomo with guns, cutlasses and other dangerous weapons, thereby inflicting bodily injuries on her. In his judgment, Justice Daramola said, “I found the accused person guilty of armed robbery as laid down before me, and they should face the supreme punishment for the offence. Therefore, the sentence of the court upon you is that you be hanged by the neck until you are dead.” Hearing into the case began on March 27, 2017. During hearing, the prosecuting counsel, Barrister Gbemiga Adaramola, from the Ministry of Justice, called two witnesses and also tendered a cut-to-size pistol, an iPad and the victim’s statement on oath as exhibits. Counsel to the defendants, Barrister Adeyinka Opaleke, didn’t call any witness. The victim was said to be reading at night when the accused persons broke into her apartment and robbed her at gunpoint. One of the convicts was said to have made a mistake of calling the actual name of his colleague during the operation, which served as a veritable lead for the police to carry out their investigations.
