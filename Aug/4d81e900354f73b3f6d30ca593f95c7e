This, the Corporation said, exceeded the maximum prudential threshold of 5%. But the disclosure which was contained in the 2018 annual report of the corporation hosted in its website yesterday also indicates that it is still  an improvement when compared with NPLs ratio of 14.84% recorded as at 31st December, 2017. The report further  highlighted that  the banking  industry NPLs decreased by 25.15% to ₦1.79 trillion in 2018 from ₦2.36trn in 2017. In the same vein, the NPLs to Shareholders’ Fund Ratio improved from 69.21% in 2017 to 57.50% in 2018.

The increase in the CAR could be explained by the 44.88% increase in the total qualifying capital from ₦2,201.58 billion in 2017 to ₦3,189.55 billion in 2018 and complemented by the 2.89% decline in the Total Risk-Weighted Assets from ₦21,520.82 billion in 2017 to ₦20,898.71 billion in 2018.

The banking industry unaudited profit before tax (PBT) significantly rose from ₦150 billion in 2017 to ₦310 billion in 2018. That could be attributed to a reduction in operating expenses by 25% from ₦440 billion in 2017 to ₦330 billion in 2018. The Yield on Earning Assets increased from 2.62% as at 31st December, 2017 to 3.23% as at 31st December, 2018.
