The Young Progressive Forum, a group championing the interest of South-East chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has condemned the attack on the former Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, by members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). The group said the treatment meted to Senator Ekweremadu at Nuremberg, Germany was barbaric, saying it was against Igbo core values and respect for elders. The group made this known in a statement signed by its leader, Comrade Otimkpu Paschal Chizoba. Chizoba described the incident as an embarrassment to the Igbo nation and Nigeria at large in the eyes of international community. “It is also shamefully pathetic that an event, which was nobly put together by the Ndi-Igbo community whose members make up the majority of Nigerians living in Germany, ended up in such a disgraceful manner,” he stated. “We may not agree with him (Ekweremadu) politically because of differences in parties, but this is height of insult on Igbo leaders. Last time it was former Governor Rochas Okorocha at Chatham House London. Today, it is Senator Dr Ike Ekweremadu. “Enough is enough. Nnamdi Kanu should be called to order. Resorting to mob mentality and venting the spleen on our leaders will rather create a vacuum that will leave our people helpless and confused in the circumstance,” he said.
