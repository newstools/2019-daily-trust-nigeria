Governor Bello Muhammad Matawalle of Zamfara State has approved the removal of the Emir of Maru, Alhaji Abubakar Cika and the district head of Kanoma Alhaji Lawal Ahmad. In a statement signed by the state Deputy governor, Barrister Mahdi Aliyu Gusau, governor Mutawalle approved, on Friday, the deposition of the Emir and the district head with immediate effect. The duo were suspended last June following protests by their subjects amid allegations of connivance with armed bandits and cattle rustlers in the state. Consequently, a high powered committee, headed by the former Inspector general of Police MD Abubakar, was constituted to investigate their involvement in armed banditry and cattle rustling. The committee, after discreet investigation, found them wanting and finally recommended the removal of the emir and the district head. The affected district head is also under Maru emirate council.
