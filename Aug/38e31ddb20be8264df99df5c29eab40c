The former governorship candidate of the Peoples Progressives Alliance (PPA) in Cross River State, Mr Goodie Akpama, has alleged that the immediate past Resident Electoral Commissioner in the state, Frankland Briyai, received bribe from some politicians in the ruling party during the last general elections in the state. But Dr Briyai in his reaction has challenged his critics to bring proof of his corrupt enrichment, adding that many of the critics were those whom he did not agree with during the last general elections. Akpama, a former state chairman of Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), in a statement, yesterday, alleged that the ex-REC had corruptly enriched himself whilst he served in Cross River State. He therefore called on the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) to look into the allegation of bribery against the REC, maintaining that Briyaiâ€™s activities since he assumed office in the state were controversial up till his exit.
