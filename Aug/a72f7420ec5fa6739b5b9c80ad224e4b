With the political will of my administration in the last four years and the courage of EFCC chairman Ibrahim Magu, it’s possible to have a society where corruption is reduced. “It’s my hope that you will join us in taking corruption and criminality out of governance so that our nation will be prosperous and safer for future generation,” he said.
