A team of Christian and Muslim clerics on Thursday took a cut down prices of food campaign to some markets in Kaduna state ahead on the forth coming holy month of Ramadan.   Speaking at the launch of the campaign in some local market across the 23 local market of the state, Pastor Yohanna Buru said the aimed of the campaign is to dialogue with various market unions and other stakeholder in other to appealed to them to either cut-down their prices or leave the price they way they are.  According to him, “The campaign is necessary to enable Muslims buy food stuff and fruits at affordable prices throughout the 30 days of Ramadan for breaking their Fast because God will surely be angry with any seller that double the price of his goods just to take advantage of the demand during the holy season  “Stop taking advantage of people in the holy month through inflating prizes of goods and service for your personal interest, but rather reduce your prices to help the widows, physically challenged, orphans and Internally Displaced Person (IDPs) feed during Ramadan.”  Buru added, “We have observed that each and every year, marketers from Northern Nigeria take advantage of the holy month to extort money from the public, this is not really good because God is angry with such marketers, and as such, there will not be any blessings from the money he/she makes from such dirty gains.   “We must team up as Christians and Muslims to kick against all forms of extortion from the marketers that will affect any Muslim during the sacred month because we are from one God and Adam and Eve were our original parents.”   He called on wealthy individual to remember to help the needy during the holy month.   Responding, Secretary, Kaduna State Association of Tomato Sellers, Mallam Dalhatu Adamu Aliyu thanked the clerics for the visit and urged marketers not to increase prices of goods for the sake of Ramadan.   Among the markets visited include Checheniya, Barnawa, Awo, Mando, Tudun Wada, Badarawa and Unguwan Dosa amongst others. Again, Ramadan is here AHLAN YA RAMADAN!
