Kano State Governor Abdullahi Ganduje yesterday said it was unfortunate that the leadership of the Hisbah Board was “gradually deviating from its main function.” The governor was speaking after contracting the marriage of 70 out of 1,500 couples at the Kano Central Mosque yesterday. He said: “Government will not take it anymore the wrong doings being committed by the leadership of Hisbah. The leadership that is expected to be guided by the teachings of Qur’an and hadith of the Holy Prophet (SAW) is being guided by the opinions of some individuals. “And unfortunately, the Hisbah leaders, because of their ignorance, believe that praising people is the right thing to do. This is unacceptable and government must address this problem.” Ganduje promised to sign the family bill to address marriage-related problems in the state. He also pledged to overhaul the Kano Hisbah Board for effective implementation of the proposed law. He said after his government received the report of the law from the Kano Emirate Council, it would transmit it to the state house of assembly. “This law is not for me, not for the emir and not for the All Progressives Congress. Rather, it is a divine law meant to guide the ummah on how to improve on their marriage lives in accordance with teachings of Islam. In view of this, every Muslim has a role to play in making this law effective,” the governor said.
