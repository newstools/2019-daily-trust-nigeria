Zamfara state Commissioner for Higher Education, Prof. Kabir Jabaka has resigned his appointment with the state government, Daily Trust learnt on Tuesday. Confirming the resignation to our reporter in Gusau, Prof Jabaka said he took the decision voluntarily in order to save his face from what he called imminent disgrace from some top government officials in the state. “There are allegations against me that I’m supporting the state’s governorship candidates in the February elections popularly known as Group 8. Based on this, they withheld my salaries and other entitlements for about five months now. “As if this is not enough, they took the matter before the state house of assembly and the members of the house passed votes of no confidence on me as an apparent move to frustrate my stay in the cabinet. Then, I decided to honourably resign. “Despite their desperation to see that I vacate office, I continued doing my work even without the being paid and I can tell you that I have no issue with the Executive governor. It is just an attempt to blackmail me,” he added. Professor Jabaka further said that he left his place of primary assignment and took up the appointment initially not because being a commissioner was more financially rewarding than where he had left, but out of zeal to contribute his own quota towards the development of the state. He then thanked Governor Abdulaziz Yari for finding him worthy of the appointment and giving him the opportunity to serve the state.
