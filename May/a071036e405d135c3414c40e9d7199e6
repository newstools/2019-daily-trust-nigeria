Edo state governor, Godwin Obaseki, has said there is no in-fighting among members of the state chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC). He described the rumour of in-fighting as fake news by few individuals who want the party to put them first above the interest of all. Obaseki said this yesterday during an enlarged meeting with APC leaders from Edo North Senatorial District, held in Jattu, Etsako West Local Government Area. “After a meeting with APC leaders in the three senatorial districts of the state, the feedback so far was that there was no issue. “The consensus is that there are a few people trying to seek for positions they hope may be available in Abuja. In doing this, they create the impression that there are several groups in the state. “We have one solid, united party and the majority of the leaders all agree that as a government, we have done well. The people are happy with the government and the party is happy with us as well,” he said. According to him, APC is a progressive party that puts the welfare of the people first above any other interest. “Some individuals want us to put them first, which is against party’s philosophy.  In our party, we don’t share money or public fund but use it for the benefit of the people,” he said.
