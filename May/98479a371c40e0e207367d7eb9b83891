The Chief Executive Officer of the bank, Mr. Nnamdi Okonkwo, recently said: “Two years ago, we set out at Fidelity Bank, to drive a five-year strategic plan, beginning from last year, that would see us migrating to a tier 1 bank in the country by 2022. What we actually did was to take the growth rate of the banks that we know are bigger than us that are in tier 1, and measured it against our growth rate, to determine how much we needed to grow for us to break into the league of Tier 1 banks. Year-on-year, balance sheet size, deposit and profitability, we have been growing.
