The United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) has said the release of 894 children, including 106 girls from the ranks of the Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) in Maiduguri, north-east Nigeria today is a step in the right direction. The CJTF is a local militia that helps the Nigerian security forces in the fight against insurgency in north-east Nigeria. It was formed in 2013, with the aim of protecting communities from attack. UNICEF representative in Nigeria and the Co-chair of United Nations Country Task Force on Monitoring and Reporting on Grave Child Rights Violations (CTFMR), Muhammed Fall while reacting to the release of the children said, any commitment for children that is matched with action is a step in the right direction for the protection of children’s rights and must be recognised and encouraged. “Children of north-east Nigeria have borne the brunt of this conflict. They have been used by armed groups in combatant and non-combatant roles and witnessed death, killing and violence. This participation in the conflict has had serious implications for their physical and emotional well-being.” He said, the children and young people released today will benefit from reintegration programmes to help them return to civilian life, seize new opportunities for their own development, and contribute to bringing lasting peace in Nigeria, as productive citizens of their country adding that with this support, many of the children released from armed groups struggle to fit into civilian life, as most are not educated and have no vocational skills. Fall also said, since September 2017, when the CJTF signed an action plan committing to put measures in place to end and prevent recruitment and use of children, 1,727 children and young people have been released. Since then, there has been no new recruitment of children by the CJTF. “In the ongoing armed conflict in north-east Nigeria, more than 3,500 children were recruited and used by non-state armed groups between 2013 and 2017. Others have been abducted, maimed, raped and killed. We cannot give up the fight for the children, as long as children are still affected by the fighting. We will continue until there is no child left in the ranks of all armed groups in Nigeria,” said Fall.
