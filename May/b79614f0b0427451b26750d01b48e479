The Kaduna State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) has urged Kaduna residents to clear their drainage to avoid flooding ahead of the rainy season. The Executive Secretary of the agency, Mr Ben Kure, made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Kaduna. Kure expressed dismay over the manner residents dump refuse in drainage across the state. According to him, the residents’ refuse disposal habits are a source of worry to the Agency, as they could lead to environmental health problems. He urged residents to compliment government’s effort at ensuring environmental hygiene. He said the agency was taking proactive measures to ensure proper sensitization of the people on the consequences of leaving drainage blocked. “We cannot stop the rains from falling but we can reduce the damage caused and lives lost.” “We have reviewed and updated the Kaduna State Contingency Plan for 2019-2020.” “With the updated contingency plan which have been launched in collaboration with Christian Aid, we are embarking on massive enlightenment campaign by deploying staffs to flood prone areas to begin sensitising residents, communities, to ensure their drains are cleared,” he said. Kure said the agency`s focus would be in Angwan Rimi, Malali, Rafin Guza and Dantoro road in Kaduna North, Barnawa and Bashama areas of Kaduna South, and Angwan Romi, Television and Nasarawa of Chikun LGAs.
