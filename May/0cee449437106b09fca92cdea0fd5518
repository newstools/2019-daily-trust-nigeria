The Nigerian Army yesterday announced its strategy for tackling banditry and kidnapping in the Northwest through reorganizing and expanding the scope and area of responsibility of Exercise Harbin Kunama III. The Chief of Army Staff (CAS), Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai who made this known during a press conference at the Army Headquarters in Abuja, said the military operation since inception on March 13 had been successful in flushing out the bandits. Buratai who was represented by the Chief of Training and Operations, Nigerian Army, Major General Lamidi Adeosun, said several bandits and criminal elements had been captured and killed while some camps, hideouts and equipment of the criminals had been destroyed. He said it was observed that there appeared to be a resurgence of the activities of bandits in other contiguous states to Zamfara. He said this was occasioned by fleeing bandits that resorted to attacking soft targets while relocating to other safe havens within contiguous states of Katsina and Sokoto. He said current threat assessments revealed the migration of the bandits from their epicentre to other areas in Kaduna, Kano and Niger states. He said, “It is against this backdrop that Exercise Harbin Kunama III is being re-organized and its mandate expanded to effectively ensure the complete defeat of the fleeing bandits.” “This is to restore public confidence and enhance safety while also ensuring socio-economic activities continue without fear or intimidation,” he added.
