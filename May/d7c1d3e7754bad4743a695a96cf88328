An associate of Alhaji Atiku Abukakar, presidential candidate of the PDP, Alhaji Mohammed Abdullahi Sugar, has threatened to sue the Minister of Information, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, for alleging that the former vice president is plotting to derail the government of President Muhammadu Buhari. Alhaji Sugar asked Lai to immediately produce the evidence or face legal action. Sugar said, “We’ll not take this again. It is either he, Lai, comes out with the evidence or the court will compel him to do so. Enough is enough.” He said the allegations were part of the plots of the APC government to portray the former vice president in bad light following their failure on two occasions. “They are spreading this falsehood because they are afraid that their games are up. First, they started with the allegation that Atiku is a thief and corrupt, but up till now, they haven’t found anything incriminating against him. “When they discovered that the corruption allegation won’t work, they brought the issue of his citizenship. They alleged that he is not a Nigerian. That one too failed the way APC government is failing. “Now they have brought the issue that he is planning to derail the government. How can that be possible? This allegation is irrational. Atiku is not a terrorist.  I will drag Lai to court for him to be compelled to substantiate the allegation against Atiku. He must tell the world. This thing must stop,” he said.
