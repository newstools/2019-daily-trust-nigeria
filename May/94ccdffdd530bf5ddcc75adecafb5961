The Chairman of the South South Governors’ Forum and Governor of Bayelsa State, Seriake Dickson, has called on all state governors to adhere to the principle of rotation in the election of a new  Chairman of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum (NGF), as the election holds today, in Abuja. In a statement on Wednesday, by his Special Adviser on Media Relations,  Mr. Fidelis Soriwei, the governor said the decision on who should be the next Chairman of the Forum should be guided by the time tested principle of rotation between the North and South. The governor said the next Chairman of the NGF should come from the South through a consensus with the end of the tenure of Governor Abdulazeez Yari of Zamfara state. Governor Dickson also said the governors elected on the platform of the PDP would not contest the position in consonance with the precedence that the NGF Chairman should be a ranking governor from the ruling political party. “Now that the Alhaji Abdulazeez Yari, Governor of Zamfara State would be ending his tenure, we expect that the next chairman should come from the South. “The precedence is that the ruling party produces the Chairman. The PDP Governors have no desire to be disruptive and expect that a ranking Governor from the APC, the party with the majority would be the next chairman,” he said. Dickson congratulated Yari on the successful completion of his tenure during which he collaborated with the federal government to address a myriad of issues including the refund of the Paris Club money and other issues affecting state finances.
