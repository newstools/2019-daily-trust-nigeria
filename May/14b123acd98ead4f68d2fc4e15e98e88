The House of Representatives yesterday fine-tuned the 2010 Electoral‎ Act (Amendment) Bill, which was denied assent by President Muhammadu Buhari in 2018. This followed the adoption of a report on a ‘Bill for an Act to amend the provisions of the Electoral Act, 2010,’ by a Committee of the Whole chaired by Speaker Yakubu Dogara. Chairman of the House Committee on Rules and Business, Edward Pwajork (PDP, Plateau), said the amendments of the Principal Act became necessary in view of the prevalent realities. Some of the amendments included Section 18(1), (2), (3) and (4) of the Principal Act‎, which dealt with the replacement of the Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs). Others included Sections 36 (1), (2), (3); 85(1) and156. The amended Section 18(3) stipulated that‎ “No person shall issue a replacement of a PVC to any voter on polling day or less than 30 days before polling day.” It further stated that anyone who contravened ‎the subsection committed an offense, and was liable on conviction to 5 years imprisonment or option of N5 million.
