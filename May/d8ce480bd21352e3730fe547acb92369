South Africa will spend 100m rand ($7m) less on President Cyril Ramaphosa’s inauguration compared to the cost of swearing in Jacob Zuma for second term five years ago. Announcing the change, Minister in the presidency Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said spending had to be reduced because “we all know there is economic difficulty in this country”. As part of the cost-cutting measures, only southern African heads of state and the leaders of continental and regional bodies have been invited to the inauguration on 25 May. The government has also opted for a sports stadium in the capital, Pretoria, rather than the area in front of the Union Buildings, the office of the presidency, because it was cheaper to prepare, Dr Dlamini-Zuma said.
