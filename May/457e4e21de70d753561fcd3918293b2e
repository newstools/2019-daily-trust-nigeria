The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) has written to the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) to quickly approve a 250 megawatts (MW) spinning reserve procurement to tackle grid system collapse. The Managing Director of TCN, Mr Usman Gur Mohammed in a briefing, weekend, revealed this, adding that the company had procured 250MW spinning reserve but was awaiting for NERC to approve the implementation. Mohammed said TCN had restored the national grid after a collapse, on Wednesday, caused nationwide outage that lasted till Thursday. He said the spinning reserve would ensure fluctuations on the national grid are managed to prevent future system collapse. He also said multiple tripping of the transmission line along the Onitsha route and a Generation Company (GenCo) that suddenly stopped operation could be the cause of the collapse. He said, “The reason for the grid collapse was that there was a multiple tripping around Onitsha substation. We are also suspecting that one of the generators went out. “We have sent our team of engineers to go and investigate.” National electricity grid records temporary collapse on Sept 28 - TCN How over N16.6bn power surveillance projects failed to improve grid – TCN Why N16.6bn power surveillance projects failed to improve grid Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
