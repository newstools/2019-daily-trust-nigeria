The immediate past Secretary to the Lagos State Government, Tunji Bello has lambasted former Governor Akinwunmi Ambode, describing his four-year administration as ‘amteurish’ and ‘less-fulfilled.’ Bello, in a farewell message yesterday accused the Ambode administration of executing projects that ‘lacked souls.’ “Since we are all part of the success stories we must also share in the weaknesses and failures. Our main drawback is our government’s inability to apply enough emotional intelligence in the administration of the state.” Odu’a Investment: I leave Sanwo-Olu to appoint Lagos representatives  –  Ambode We took decisions with best interest of Lagos in mind – Ambode Lagos residents consume N3B food daily-Ambode Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
