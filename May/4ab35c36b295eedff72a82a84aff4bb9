A Kano State House of Assembly member representing Dambatta Local Government, Alhaji Hafizu Sani Mai Daji has staged a walkout in protest of the proposed demarcation of the new emirates. Mai Daji told newsmen on Wednesday that he staged a walkout from the plenary because there was inequality in the demarcation. He said, “Dambatta local government has not been given the attention it deserved. Dambatta should be given emirate, not Bichi. The district head of Dambatta is the oldest district head in Kano and also kingmaker. “There is no justification for creating Bichi emirate and that is why I staged a walkout from the session to show my anger because my observation was not recognised by the House.” Why I chose Wambai  as Galadiman Kano  – Emir Sanusi Sarkin Bai lends support to Buhari’s anti-graft war Encounter with North’s  longest serving traditional ruler Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
