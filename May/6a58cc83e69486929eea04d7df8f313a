The Islamic Youth League of Nigeria (IYLN) has donated items to patients at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital (UATH), Gwagwalada. Among the items donated were toothpaste, beverages, soap, detergent, sugar, milk, toiletries and towels. Speaking to newsmen after the donation, the National Ameera of IYLN, Alhaja Raliat Adenike Akinbobola, said the gesture was to support the less privileged patients at the hospital and to also offer prayers for their quick healing. Alhaja Akinbobola also said the event was  in preparation for the upcoming Ramadan and to also mark the national conference of the league, which she said had been slated for next week. She said it was on that premise that the league decided to commence its visit to UATH to support the patients. According to her, the league’s branch in Abeokuta, Ogun State, was replicating the gesture by reaching out to the less privileged and orphans. She further said the league in 2018 carried out empowerment programmes for women across the FCT. The ameera, therefore, called on the Federal Government to intensify effort towards upgrading facilities at the the teaching hospital. “What we see here is a pathetic situation  whereby  some patients in the hospital do not get what they deserve, but we pray that the government will look into our health sector,” she said. A patient, Mrs. Rebecca James Bako, expressed appreciation to the league for identifying with the less privileged patients at the hospital. She prayed God to continue to protect and guard the league for its humanitarian gesture to the less privileged and called on other organisations to emulate the league.
