Afghan politicians and women’s rights activists are demanding justice after a political adviser and former prominent TV presenter was murdered in broad daylight. Mina Mangal, who worked as a television presenter before entering politics, was shot dead at close range in Kabul on Saturday. Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah vowed her killers would be caught. The motive remains unclear but one line of inquiry is a family dispute. In a statement released on Saturday, the interior ministry said that Ms Mangal, who was on her way to work as an adviser for the Afghan parliament’s cultural affairs commission, was shot dead around 07:20 local time. Afghanistan’s Supreme Court and civil society groups including the commission into violence against women have called for a serious investigation into her killing.
