The All Progressives Congress (APC) Youth Caucus in the North-Central has asked for the position of Secretary to the Government of Federation (SGF) in the next administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. The youth caucus under the leadership of the APC Zonal Youth Leader, Comrade Terver Aginde, in a statement released in Abuja,  after an emergency meeting held on Sunday in Lafia, implored the party to ensure equity while sharing National Assembly leadership positions among the six geo-political zones. The youth in the statement signed by Aginde, said the conference agreed to urge Comrade Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee (NWC) to convene National Executive Council (NEC) meeting of the party that was long overdue. “We also advise the party to heal wounds and build a stronger and United APC rather than destroy it,” the statement said. “We don’t see any reason for suspending people in the party, instead a NEC meeting should be called to review all that went wrong and find a lasting way of bringing the party back to its promises to Nigerians,” the statement also read. Aginde appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure the next minister of youths and sport got  two-third endorsement from the party’s youth wing to get the youths fully involved in APC administration. “APC is a national party and it should be given a national look by building a united Nigeria that will accommodate all the six geo-political zones, not minding religion or tribe,” the caucus said.
