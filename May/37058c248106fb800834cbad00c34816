The Executive Secretary of Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) Prof Suleiman Elias Bogoro has disclosed that the fund has commenced the payment of their sponsored scholars who are stranded in the course of their studies overseas. Bogoro stated this yesterday when the management of Daily Trust newspaper paid him a courtesy visit in his office in Abuja. Earlier, he had said the fluctuations in the foreign exchange vis-a-vis the Naira and the non-compliance with the fundâ€™s guidelines by the home institutions of the scholars are largely responsible for the plight of the scholars. Speaking on the possible innovation he will bring to the Fund, he said they are driving Research and Development (R&D) to the next level by bringing the researchers and the industries together. He said the professors need to improve on the quality of researches carried out, he said they want to see professors going for sabbatical to industries.
