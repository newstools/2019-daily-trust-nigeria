There has been a lull in hostilities in the Gaza Strip after Palestinians said a ceasefire with Israel had been agreed. It comes after a weekend during which Palestinian militants launched hundreds of rockets into Israel prompting retaliatory air and artillery strikes. At least four Israelis and 25 Palestinians were killed. Israel has not confirmed the truce, but its military has lifted emergency measures in place in southern Israel. The violence flared up on Friday during a protest against the blockade of Gaza. A TV station run by Hamas – the militant movement which controls Gaza – announced that both sides had agreed the ceasefire, beginning at 04:30 local time (01:30 GMT). Egypt is said to have brokered it – assisted by the United Nations and Qatar. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has not mentioned the truce, though the military said it had lifted protective restrictions in southern Israel.
