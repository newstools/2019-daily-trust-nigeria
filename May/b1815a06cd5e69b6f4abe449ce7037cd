The Controller General of Prisons, Ja’afaru Ahmed has approved the recommendation of Zone ‘C’ Disciplinary Committee for the dismissal of Prison Assistant 1, Umar Adamu from the Nigerian Prisons Service for the offence of trafficking (smuggling) illicit drugs into the prison yard for prisoners. The Public Relations Officer of the Service, DCP Francis Enobore disclosed this in a statement on Monday. He said the action of the Controller General was part of a concerted effort by the administration to continue to maintain discipline and ensure that inmates in Prison custody were only handled by those with the required rectitude to do so. “There is no gainsaying that exposing inmates to the use of hard drugs is an anathema to the reformation goal of the Prisons Service as it does not only precipitate health complications but also constitutes security risk to innocent lives in and around the prison,” the statement noted. Mr. Ja’afaru therefore, warn that any officer caught in such act will be shown the way out of the Service as they have no business being in a character reformation agency. He assured the public that the management of the NPS would remain irrevocably committed to sustain the peace and calm now existing in prisons across the country in order to enhance reformation and rehabilitation of offenders in prisons custody.
