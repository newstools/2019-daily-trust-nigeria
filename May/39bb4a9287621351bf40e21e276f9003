Surveillance streetlights have been launched in Karu Local Government Area of Nasarawa State to help curb crime and control traffic. Governor Umaru Almakura who launched the lights at the premises of the Nasarawa Geographic Information System, (NAGIS) in Mararaba, Karu local government near Abuja, said the smart streetlights would be mounted from the boundary with FCT to Keffi. “The smart streetlights  which will be mounted along Abuja-Keffi Road are equipped with high quality 100 watts Light Emitting Diode (LED), outdoor Wi-Fi, which covers a radius of 300 metres and 6 mega pixel surveillance camera,” the governor said. He said the technology would enhance security in Karu, as it would cover activities in a data bank, which could be retrieved to assist security agents to investigate crimes and prosecute offenders. Governor Almakura said the initiative was conceived when the Nasarawa boundary with Abuja witnessed bombings in 2014 and  the state felt obliged to protect lives and property. “That is why we are working with NAGIS and consultants to ensure adequate tracking of security breach within and around the area,” he said. He called on the consultants to alternate between the national grid, generator and to introduce solar power to the smart streetlights for optimum performance. In his remarks, the Emir of Nasarawa, Alhaji Ibrahim Usman Jibrin, who was a staff of both Abuja Geographic Information System (AGIS) and NAGIS said the installation and commissioning of the smart streetlight was timely for the wellbeing of the people.
