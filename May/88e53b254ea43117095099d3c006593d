A court in China has sentenced a Canadian citizen to death for producing and trafficking methamphetamine. Fan Wei is the second Canadian to be sentenced to death this year. Ten others, including five foreigners, were also sentenced on Tuesday. Relations between Canada and China have been tense since the December arrest of a Huawei executive in Vancouver. Canada accused Beijing of arbitrarily applying the death penalty. In January, another Canadian, Robert Lloyd Schellenberg, had a 15-year jail term turned to death sentence – prompting condemnation from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Beijing rejected his comments, saying that Canada was practising “double standards”. 2 Egyptian police get 25-year jail term for torturing citizen to death Seven to die over Kuwait mosque attack IRAQ: German woman sentenced to death over IS involvement
