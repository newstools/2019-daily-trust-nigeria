Shagari then filed a petition at the Tribunal, stating that Yabo did not score the highest number of lawful votes cast at the polls and that the election was marred by electoral irregularities not in compliance with Electoral ACT 2010 as amended. At the sitting of the Tribunal, Counsel to Shagari and PDP, the petitioners, Mr Kelechi Ogbonna who held brief for Mahmud Abubakar Magaji (SAN), told the court that they indicated 95 witnesses in the petition but had streamlined it to 49.
