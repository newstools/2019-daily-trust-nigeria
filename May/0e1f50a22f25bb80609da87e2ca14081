The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Ogun Command on Friday said a total number of 11,251 unclaimed drivers licenses are in its custody. A statement made available to newsmen on Friday in Abeokuta by the Command’s Spokesperson, Florence Okpe expressed worry that driver’s licenses produced are lying uncollected at the various Licensing Offices across the State. Okpe said the development becomes worrisome because a number of drivers apprehended for traffic offence have no valid licenses. She, however, said the Command has intensified its enforcement drive to improve highway safety in the state .”It is however worrisome that most of those apprehended for driving without driver’s license, have their driver’s licenses produced but lying uncollected at the various licensing Offices across the State.” “As at Friday 03 May, 2019, there are 11,251 driver’s licenses unclaimed in Ogun State which are  at the various  Licencing Offices.””Motorists are hereby reminded that driving without a valid driver’s license attracts a fine of N10, 000” Were you tested for driver’s licence?
