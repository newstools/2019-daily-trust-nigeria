Japan’s Emperor Akihito has declared his abdication in a historic ceremony at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo. In his last public address as emperor, Akihito handed over the symbols of power and thanked the public for their support during his 30-year reign. The 85-year-old said he felt unable to fulfil his role because of his age and declining health. He is the first Japanese monarch to stand down in more than 200 years. His eldest son, Crown Prince Naruhito, 59, will ascend the throne today as Japan’s 126th emperor. The emperor holds no political power, but serves as a national figurehead. The ceremony took place at the Imperial Palace in front of about 300 people including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Empress Michiko, Crown Prince Naruhito, and Crown Princess Masako. The 59-year-old crown prince, an  Oxford University graduate is married to Crown Princess Masako. Their only child, Princess Aiko, was born in 2001. Japan’s current law prohibits women from inheriting the throne, so Princess Aiko’s uncle Prince Fumihito is now first in line.
