The Federal Government plans to create 20 million jobs to reduce unemployment in the second tenure of President Muhammadu Buhari. The minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Dr Okechukwu Enelamah, disclosed this in Abuja yesterday at a stakeholders meeting on job creation organised by the Industrial Training Fund (ITF). The minister, who was represented by the Ministry’s Permanent Secretary, Sunday Edet Akpan, said the Federal Government would create the jobs from the four key sectors of the economy: Agriculture, Construction, Transport and the Services sectors. He said the ministry had directed the Industrial Training Fund to come up with innovative solutions to create 20 million jobs in four sectors of the economy within the next four years. “In order to sustain and build on the successes recorded in this regard in the first tenure of Mr.  President, we are articulating and strategising with a renewed impetus towards combating the twin evils of unemployment and insecurity,” the Minister said. The Director General of the ITF, Sir Joseph Ari, said the ITF has equipped over 450,000 Nigerians with life skills and empowered all the beneficiaries with start-up kits within the last two years. He said: “over 80 per cent of this number today are earning sustainable livelihoods either in the paid employment or are successful entrepreneurs who are even employing others. The stories are similar in a number of agencies with mandates to empower Nigerians with skills for employability and growth.” FG to create 20m jobs in Buhari's second tenure – Minister FG adopts strategies to create 20m jobs FG plans automobile clusters in Lagos, Nnewi, Kano Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
