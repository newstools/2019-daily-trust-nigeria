Having recovered from the recession, coupled with impactful policies and reforms introduced by the Federal Government, the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has said that the nation’s economy is now on a growth path. LCCI, in its economic review of four years of President Mohammadu Buhari’s administration, noted that though the absence of an economic blueprint in the early days of the administration created challenges of uncertainty, but with the launched of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) in April 2017, it provided clearer economic policy direction of the administration as it has enhanced the level of investors’ confidence and diminished uncertainties. “The indications were that the government was committed to the implementation of the plan.  The establishment of the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council [PEBEC] gave a boost to investors’ confidence”. The report which was signed by its Director General, Muda Yusuf, LCCI explained that the frequent injection of liquidity by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has helped moderated the volatility of the rates and improved forex liquidity in the market. “While banking sector credit to government has been increasing over the past few years, banking credits to the private sector has been on the decline. “Investments in treasury bills and Federal Government bonds have become more attractive than investments in the real economy such as manufacturing, agriculture and solid minerals,” it noted.
