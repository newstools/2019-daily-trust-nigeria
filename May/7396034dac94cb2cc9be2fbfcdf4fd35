The FCT Police Command yesterday said it barricaded the roads leading to the Court of Appeal, venue of the Presidential Election Tribunal, to forestall actions that could disrupt the tribunal sitting. A statement by the command’s spokesman, DSP Anjuguri Manzah, added that the action was a proactive measure meant to beef up security at the venue to avoid breakdown of law and order. “While regretting the inconveniences this might have caused law-abiding citizens, especially those who have to use the said route to access their offices and businesses, the Command wants to reiterate that its action was purely to avoid any clash that might arise between supporters of both parties. “The Command seizes this medium to appreciate residents for their usual cooperation and reassure them that their safety is its utmost priority,” the statement read in part.
