The outgoing governor of Nasarawa State, Alhaji Umaru Tanko Al-Makura has formally handed over keys of the Government House, Lafia  to incoming Governor Engr. Abdullahi Sule. Al-Makura handed over the keys to his successor yesterday at a brief ceremony attended by staff of the government house, and thereafter left alongside his aides as his family had vacated the premises earlier. In his remarks, Governor Al-Makura said, “We devoted many hours with my successor during the practical handing over and transition. In short, he is now good to go as he has seen the data and statistics about the projects commissioned and other issues relating to governance over the years. “Before I leave, I am happy to have left Nasarawa better than I met it; I have handed over the keys to the ‘Landlord’ of Government House, Lafia as he will be sworn in in few hours from now. I pray God to guide and protect you (new governor) and give you peace and comfort in this house,” he said. In his remarks, incoming Governor Sule said, “I have closely monitored the works of Governor Al-Makura; he is not taking anything out of government house. I am promising the people of Nasarawa that I will make it better than I met it. I pray for him and his family God’s guidance and protection.” Nasarawa: Al-Makura hands over Government House keys to Sule Impeachment: The moves that may save Al-Makura Al-Makura sets up panel to probe Sen Adamu Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
