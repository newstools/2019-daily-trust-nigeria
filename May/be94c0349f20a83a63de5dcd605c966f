The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) has beefed up security on the Abuja-Kaduna rail service corridor in response to the rising traffic on the corridor and new security threats. The Operations Manager of the Abuja-Kaduna Train Service, Sir Victor Adamu, disclosed this yesterday during the training of private guards engaged to provide auxiliary security services on the corridor. Adamu said the NRC was not losing sleep on security hence the need for Kwochason Global Guards, the private security firm that provides security services on the corridor to respond to new security threats. “We take the issue of security serious, more so that we are experiencing security challenges on the Abuja-Kaduna highway which has pushed huge passenger traffic to the train service. So we are providing maximum security to passengers and our facilities on the rail corridor,” he assured. Mr. Otor Lazarus, the Company Secretary, Kwochason Global Guards, said they had increased the guards, adding that they were being trained to be able to effectively man the exit and entry points, as well as improve surveillance services. He also said the guards were being trained to handle new security gadgets that had been procured. The lead trainer, Mr. Oyelade John Gabriel, the Chief Superintended of Corps (CSC) Private Guards Department, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSDC), Abuja Command, said they were giving the guards basic security training.  10 new coaches for Kaduna-Abuja train to arrive November Chaos, touting, overwhelm Abuja, Kaduna  train stations Keeping new railway on track Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
