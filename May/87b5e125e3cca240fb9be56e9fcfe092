Lepers in the Alheri Special Village, Yangoji, Kwali Area Council of Abuja, have expressed dismay that despite helping to bring president Muhammadu Buhari into power in 2015 and earlier this year, they were yet to benefit from his government. Head of the village, Ali Isa stated this on Saturday while receiving food items donated to the village by the Qatari Charity Organization. He lamented that for over six years, the community had no electricity as a result of their transformer being stolen, and as a result of the darkness, the villagers battle snakes and other reptiles at night. He also complained that the health clinic made available to them had no drugs, adding that they were not assisted with fertilizers for their farms as well. Ali therefore, called on government to come to their aid in providing them basic amenities. He said it was a shame that only international organizations were assisting them with donations while government turned a blind eye to their plights.
