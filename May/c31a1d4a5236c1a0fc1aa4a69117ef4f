With the law, the country’s National Minimum Wage has been upped from N18,000 to N30,000. Buhari, who was represented by Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo at the May Day celebration at Eagle Square, Abuja, assured the workers that the new minimum wage would be fully implemented. He also assured the workers that his administration would continue to provide enabling environment for high productivity. On his victory at the poll, he said: “we shall reciprocate the electoral gesture by focusing on things that will improve on the standard of living of the Nigerian masses.” He said they will rework the country’s power sector, including the privatization for greater output.
