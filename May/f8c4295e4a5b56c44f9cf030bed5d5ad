Staff of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) marked the Workers Day celebration in Abuja with the appraisal of improved electricity transmission capacity saying the company was no longer the weakest link in the power sector.   Chairman of the Senior Staff Association of Electricity and Allied Companies (SSAEAC), TCN Chapter, Comrade Dairo Abidemi while addressing staff on Wednesday before they joined their counterparts at the Eagle Square for the celebration, enjoined them to be steadfast in their jobs and should keep the pace as one of the strong links in the power sector.   Abidemi said: “TCN that used to be known as the weakest link in the electricity power ring has become one of the strongest links. Due to the effort of the present management of TCN there is no need to return back to Egypt; we should aspire to move forward.”   TCN in December 2018, said transmission wheeling capacity had risen to 8,100 megawatts (MW) from 7,00MW in 2017 and 5,500MW in 2015.   The union also dissociated itself from a planned industrial dispute on TCN by the Trade Union Congress (TUC) and the President General of SSAEAC, Mr Chris Okonkwo.   Abidemi noted that it was illegal for Mr Okonkwo who is a General Manager at TCN to be the President General of SSAEAC because TCN Conditions of Service bars staff in the management cadre from holding positions in union associations.   The TCN union chairman and his colleagues dissociated themselves from the planned action saying, “We don’t have any condition to warrant dispute. We receive our salaries as at when due. We get our salaries before 20th of every month. Recently there was a promotion exercise and most of us were promoted and those who are yet to be promoted, we are working so that they can be promoted too.” DisCos chide TCN over wrong N72bn network funding DisCos push N72bn network funding to consumers Controversy trails renewal of Manitoba’s power contract
