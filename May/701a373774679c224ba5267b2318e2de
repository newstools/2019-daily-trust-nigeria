A former policeman in the US state of Minnesota has been found guilty of murdering an unarmed Australian woman. Mohamed Noor shot Justine Ruszczyk Damond as she approached his patrol car to report a possible rape behind her Minneapolis home in 2017. Noor, 33, testified last week that he opened fire because he feared he and his partner were being ambushed. Ms Damond, 40, a yoga instructor from Sydney, was engaged and was due to marry a month after the shooting.
