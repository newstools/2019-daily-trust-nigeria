A non-governmental organisation, Queen Dijah Women and Children Awareness Initiative, has called for the quick implementation of the law that prescribed life imprisonment for rapist in the state. Chairperson of the group, Khadijat Saulawa in a statement issued to newsmen at the weekend, said the signing of the amended Penal Code Law by the state governor, Aminu Masari, is a welcome development as it will go a long way in giving the desired justice to victims of rape. According to her, what remain is for the quick implementation of the law so that incessant rape being recorded across the state can be tamed or brought to a minimal level. While calling on parents, guardians and counsels to take advantage of the law to get justice for their rape victims, Saulawa said “We applaud the bold step taken by the state government and call for the quick implementation of the law in order to address the ugly trend.” “We equally urged the parents and guardians of the rape victims to take advantage of the law to get justice for the victims. “The era of saying we are leaving everything to God is over, let the law catch up with whoever violates the law. If you rape, you will be imprisoned for life. “With this, we believe when some people are made scapegoats of the law, it will serve as deterrent to others who might have similar intention,” Saulawa said.
