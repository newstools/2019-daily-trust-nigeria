Governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo State has asked a Federal High Court to order INEC to issue him a certificate of return for Imo West Senatorial District. Okorocha, through his counsel, Kehinde Ogunwumiju (SAN), argued that INEC did not make a report that he held the Returning Officer under duress to declare him winner of the election. He said the Returning Officer alleged to have been held under duress did not give any evidence whatsoever on that, adding that the police report before the court did not mention any violence during the election. But counsel to INEC, Wendy Kuku asked the court to dismiss the suit for being incompetent. She also argued that the court lacked the jurisdiction to hear the matter. Also, counsel to PDP candidate in the election, Jones Onyeriri, Nnawuchi also asked the court to dismiss the suit for being incompetent, adding that it was not supposed to be filed by originating summons. Meanwhile, Justice Okon Abang has asked one of the counsel to All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Osita Izunaso, Orji Nwafor-Orizu to produce a medical report on his mental fitness before he would be allowed to appear before the court. The order was made after Nwafor-Orizu entered the court to demand for a halt to the proceedings, brandishing a Court of Appeal order stopping the matter. Before he entered the court, another lawyer, S.N. Anichebe had already announced appearance for Izunaso in the matter.
