A former Speaker of the Imo State House of Assembly, Mr Amaechi Nwoha, has expressed his optimism that President Muhammadu Buhari will give his backing to a Nigerian of Igbo extraction to become the next speaker of the House of Representatives. “The president is a detribalized leader, who sees every part of the country as one people,” Nwoha told a correspondent of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday in Abuja. He described Buhari as father of modern Nigeria, who could not leave any section of the country behind in his administration of the nation, noting that the country’s unity and progress were top priorities for the president. Nwoha said Buhari is a nationalist and man of integrity, whose love for Nigeria had been a compelling reason for his decision to run an inclusive government. The former lawmaker restated the need to support a south easterner as speaker of the House of Representatives, saying that this would be in tune with Buhari’s vision for a united Nigeria. He also urged leaders of the APC to support a south easterner for the position, noting that such action would make the party more popular in the South East.
