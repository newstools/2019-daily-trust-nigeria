Eight of the nine Adara elders detained over the crisis in Kajuru early in the year have been released. A source who was with the nine at the Magistrate Court on Daura road, Kaduna, saidÂ  the eight were asked to go by the court for lack of any evidence against them. Initially, on the nine, Mr. Joseph Abdallah was asked to remain behind because of a confusion in his name, but he was later released after the issue had been sorted out. But one of them, Mr. Ulu Maitumbi, was however not allowed to go home at the time of filing this report. The Kajuru elders were arrested in connection with attacks on communities in the local government early this year.
