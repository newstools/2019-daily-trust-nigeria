The Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB) yesterday presented asset declaration forms to President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. Chairman of the CCB, Professor Muhammed Isah led the bureau team to make the presentation at the State House, Abuja. He said the forms were for the end of tenure and beginning of new tenure in office. Buhari would be sworn in on Wednesday for the second term. “Mr President, as part of the constitutional requirements, there is need for every public officer – president, vice, minister, members of the National Assembly to swear in his assets declaration and liabilities in compliance with paragraph 11 sub 1 of part 1 of the fifth schedule of the constitution,” the CCB chairman said. In his remarks, Buhari appealed to the bureau to keep his forms well, saying there are a lot of people who want to fight back. “I assure you I will quickly fill this form and dispatch it back to you so that at the end of 2023, I believe there are a lot of people that will like to take it back on me. “So please, make sure you keep it safe because there are people who believe they shouldn’t be questioned which they are being questioned and some of them are already in trouble,” he said.
