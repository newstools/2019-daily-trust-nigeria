The president of Cherubim & Seraphim unification in Ondo state, Primate Ade Ademisokun Torton has urged Ondo state governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, to change his anti-people’s policies, utterances and concentrate on the development of the state. The clergy said the governor was assisting his enemies by his utterances and anti-people’s policies. According to him, when the governor took over, the first thing he did was to increase tuition fees and hospital bills which did not go down well with the people. He also said that if he knew how he emerged, he should know they want to send him away because the owners of the party (APC) don’t have collaborative spirits and they also like to hand pick candidates. He said, “When they couldn’t defeat him in court, they had to wield the big stick” by suspending him from the party. He lamented that all the appointment zoned to the South went to Lagos state. He however appeal to the governor to be busy performing, working for the people and making them happy because that is the best way of campaigning. He urged the Executive arm of the federal government to leave the lawmakers alone to choose their leaders and not people that would be taking instructions from some cabal but rather those who would be working for the interest of the masses. In a related development, Pastor Toye Ebijomore of Gods Anointed and Blessed Church, Akure has said God has great plans for Nigeria because from 2021, the country will become the pride of other nations, and urged Ondo state governor to be focused.
