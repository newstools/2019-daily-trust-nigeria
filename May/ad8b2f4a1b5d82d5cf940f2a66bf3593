French courts have handed down 447 fines in the past eight months under new laws to tackle street harassment of women. The “outrages sexistes” law was passed in August 2018, and allows for on-the-spot fines of up to €750 (£650). The first fine was handed down to a man who slapped a woman’s bottom on a bus and made lewd remarks. Equality Minister Marlène Schiappa said the number of cases since had proved such measures work.
