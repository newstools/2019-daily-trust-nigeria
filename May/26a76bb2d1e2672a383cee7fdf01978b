The immediate past Adviser State on Trade and Investment to Governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo State, Barr. Rex Chinasa Anunobi, has described the travails of his former boss in the ruling APC as “nemesis at work”. Barr. Anunobi, who was fielding questions from our correspondent in Owerri on whether the ruling party treated his boss fairly following Okorocha’s lamentation that the evil he feared in his former party, PDP, had befallen him 10 times in APC, said what the governor was currently facing was what he meted out to some of his aides with who he defected to APC in 2015. Anunobi accused Okorocha of not supporting his ambition to contest for the office of the National Organising Secretary of APC. He said, “Thank God for a day like this. I remember how he treated most of us. I, Dr. Vitalis Ajumbe, Dr. Kelechi Okpaleke, Barr. Kingsley Ononuju, late Dr. Samfo Nwankwo, and so on. I remember the way he pleaded with me in 2015 and I mobilised all of them away from PDP then to join him in his new APC to ensure his re-election and Igbo support for Buhari. “After victory, he and his family and privileged few cornered the sweat of all of us, without anything to show for our near suicide commitment in helping him back to power,” he said. “Even when I consulted him to allow and support me to contest the office of the National Organising Secretary of APC, he not only denied and disowned me, but sponsored a petition against me, and went ahead to bring out and funded another person against me,” he alleged.
