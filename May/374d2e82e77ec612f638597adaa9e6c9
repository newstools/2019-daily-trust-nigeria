Kano state government is to establish N2.4billion worth modern security surveillance centre aimed at improving security in the state. The state governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, stated this on Wednesday during his inaugural speech at the swearing-in ceremony held at Sani Abacha Stadium, Kano. Ganduje said the centre would be equipped with modern surveillance facilities that would centralise security issues in the state. “Our aim is to make the work of the police, Army and other security personnel effective in the state. The centre will make security work easy. We will do it in such a way that security agencies can monitor activities of criminals from the centre through the use of CCTV screens. “Kano state government is committed to the issue of security and is ready to render any services needed to secure Kano from all forms of crimes,” he assured. He urged security agencies to work closely with the traditional institutions, noting that with the creation of four new emirates, intelligence gathering would now become easy among security agencies through the help of the traditional institutions. The governor also implored all the five emirs to support security agencies in securing the state at all times.
