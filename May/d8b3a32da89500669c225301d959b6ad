The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to end his private visit abroad, return to Nigeria and face the worsening security situation in the country. The PDP in a statement yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan said it was wrong for Buhari to be abroad while bandits, marauders and insurgents maim, kidnap and kill innocent citizens with reckless abandon. The PDP said Buhari had not demonstrated the required capacity to control the security situation, alleging that he had now resorted to cheap escapism, particularly in the face of allegations in the public space that certain individuals around his administration were benefitting from the situation. “President Buhari’s inattention has emboldened insurgents and bandits to continue to over-run communities, unleash mayhem and bloodletting on citizens in Borno, Zamfara, Yobe, Adamawa, Gombe Taraba, Kaduna, Benue, Kogi and other states of the federation, including Mr. President’s home state, Katsina,” the statement said. “While President Buhari wanders abroad, bandits are having a field day, pillaging communities in Katsina state; killing several persons and abducting the District Head of his hometown, Daura, Musa Umar; the father in-law of Mr. President’s security aide. “Within this period, marauders invaded communities in Adamawa and killed no fewer than 26 innocent Nigerians; many more have been killed in Borno, Taraba, Benue and Zamfara states, where bandits also reportedly attacked Government Girls Secondary School Moriki, and kidnapped some school girls,” the statement added.
