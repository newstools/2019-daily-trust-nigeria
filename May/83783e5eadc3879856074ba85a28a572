A 45-year-old man, Yunusa Yakubu, is in trouble for standing as surety for a suspect, Abdullahi Jamidu, who allegedly obtained N26.5 million under false presences. According to the police, Yakubu, on April 5, 2018 at the Police Special Fraud Unit, 13 Milverton Road, Ikoyi, Lagos, stood surety for AbdullahI Hamidu, a male suspect in a case of obtaining money under false pretences and stealing N26.5m, property of Gold Edge Industries Nigeria Limited. Yakubu had allegedly entered into a recognition to produce Hamidu whenever the latter was required by the police, including producing him for arraignment before the court. However since April 5, 2018, when the suspect was released to him, the surety had failed to produce Hamidu for arraignment before the court and thereby made it impossible for the police to prosecute him. The accused person pleaded not guilty and Magistrate A. F. Botoku has adjourned the case till June 1, 2019 for hearing.
