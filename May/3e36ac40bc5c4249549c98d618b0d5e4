He said the relationship between him and the former governor is very cordial, adding  that they are both working for the state.   “I feel very good, refreshed and ready to resume work after the break from work for a month.  People should expect development”  It would be recalled that Obaseki had embarked on one-month annual leave and during the period his deputy, Comrade Philip Shaibu, acted as governor.
