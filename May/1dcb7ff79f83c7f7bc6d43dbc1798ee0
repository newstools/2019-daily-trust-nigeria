The EU and leading member states have criticised a decision in Turkey to re-run Istanbul’s mayoral election, after a shock opposition win. However, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has welcomed the decision which followed complaints of corruption, saying a new poll was the “best step” for the country. An EU spokesperson called on Turkey’s electoral body to explain the controversial decision “without delay”. Germany’s Foreign Minister Heiko Mass called the re-run “incomprehensible”. The move was also criticised by France and by leading MEP Guy Verhofstadt, who said Turkey was “drifting towards dictatorship”.
