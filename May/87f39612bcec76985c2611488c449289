There was mild drama on Wednesday night as the venue of the presidential inauguration dinner was filled to the brim, forcing many invited guests including diplomats to stand. Daily Trust reports that many of the guests fought their ways into the venue.  There was heavy vehicular traffic at the road leading to the State House Conference Centre. To address the situation, the Master of Ceremony had to appeal that, “for those of you that don’t have seats, please go to the overflow.” Our correspondent reports that the event scheduled to commence at 8:05pm started 25 minutes late as Vice President Yemi Osinbajo arrived the venue at 8:30pm. In his remarks, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, apologized to the guests. He said the new mandate given to the president was in recognition of his sterling leadership quality, saying they’ve committed themselves to the development of the country.
