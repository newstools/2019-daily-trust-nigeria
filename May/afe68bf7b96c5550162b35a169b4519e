The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the senator, who is completing his fourth tenure in the NASS, was reelected for a fifth term during the just concluded general elections. The lawmaker said it was time to quit the legislature, adding that his remaining time in the NASS would afford him time to complete ongoing projects in his constituency. He said that a new breed politician with shared visions would take over from him at the expiration of the fifth term. Ekweremadu said that his 16 years sojourn in the NASS had been immensely beneficial to his constituents as it had been a harvest of projects. He thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for his support through the various projects being executed in his constituency. Ekweremadu, who traced his political evolution from his time as president general of his town union, said that his political career had not always been smooth. He said that his life had been a product of divine grace having passed through political persecution and vicissitude of life. “I have been scorched and bruised and in all of these, God protected me.
