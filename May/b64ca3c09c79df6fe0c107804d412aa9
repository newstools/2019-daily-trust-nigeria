The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Lagos Sector Command, has revealed that it has 64,468 uncollected permanent driver’s licences across the state. The command would therefore commence a special patrol on Monday next week to arrest motorists who drive without driving licence. It was learnt that the aim was to force those who might have their licences with the FRSC to come for them and arrest motorists plying Lagos roads without the licence. The State Sector Commander, Mr. Hyginus Omeje, said defaulting motorists would be fined N10, 000 if they are unable to produce the document in 24 hours. According to a statement by the Sector’s Head of Public Education, Superintendent Route Commander (SRC) Florence Edor, the special patrol code-named, “Operation Show Your Driver’s Licence” would last two weeks. The statement quoted Omeje as explaining that the two-week special patrol was aimed at reducing the high incidents of motorists driving without valid driver’s licence in the state. The Road Safety boss added that motorists who apply for licence never cared to go back to the licensing offices to collect their permanent licence. “We are starting our patrol operation by May 20, as we have 64,468 uncollected permanent driver’s licences across the state,” he said. The sector commander bemoaned the attitude of some motorists driving with their licence which he said was the only legal document which permits anyone to drive on Nigerian roads.
