The Technical Adviser to the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Dr. Timothy Okon, has said the proposed 2019 gas regulations to stabilise the price of gas is ready for submission to the Ministry of Petroleum. Dr. Okon who was the guest speaker at an interactive session on national gas policy and regulations organised by the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) yesterday in Lagos, disclosed that the 2019 regulations might be possible before May 29. However, he urged MAN to prepare advocacy to the Economic Management Team (EMT) in order to state its views and support for the gas pricing reforms. “Proposed pricing regulations for the 2019 gas aggregators company of Nigeria is ready for submission and it may be possible before May 29 but requires concerted advocacy.” he said. Detailing what the 2019 gas regulations seek to reform, he stressed that the reforms would enforce the commercial negotiated mechanism to determine the price of gas, saying that government did not give price for gas.
