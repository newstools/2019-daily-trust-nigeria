The Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, has said he will not seek re-election into the senate in 2023. Ekweremadu, who has been in the senate since 2003 representing Enugu West, said God had been kind to him, raising him to address enormous challenges his people faced. Speaking at an event to mark his 57th birthday and to appreciate God and his constituents for his re-election and triumphs yesterday in Enugu, Ekweremadu recalled how he became the chairman of his age grade association at age 10, and served as President-General of Mpu Town Union. He also recalled how he became the pioneer elected Chairman of Aninri LGA, Chief of Staff of Enugu Government House, Secretary to Enugu State Government, fourth term senator, third time Deputy President of the Senate, and the first Nigerian Speaker of the ECOWAS Parliament. He, however, observed that it had not been all rosy as he had also faced serious political challenges and persecution, a statement by his spokesman Uche Anichukwu indicated. “My life and political odyssey are products of divine grace working through destiny helpers like you, for I know where I am coming from. I also know how far the Almighty God has brought me,” he said.
