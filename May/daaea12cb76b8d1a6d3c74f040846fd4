The APC Aspirants Forum, Kogi State chapter, has endorsed Alhaji Yahaya Audu, a younger brother to a former Governor of the state, late Prince Abubakar Audu, as its preferred candidate for the November governorship election in the state. Members of the group took the decision which was contained in a communique issued on Sunday after their meeting in Abuja to discuss the lingering governorship crisis in the state. In the communique signed by Chairman of the communique drafting committee, Ben Adaji, and Secretary, Barrister Anthony Oye, the forum noted that at the end of deliberations, Alhaji Audu was unanimously endorsed to contest for the forthcoming governorship election in Kogi State. The forum also appealed to the National Chairman of APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, and the National Working Committee (NWC) not to risk the forthcoming governorship ticket of the party to Governor Yahaya Bello as this could mean losing Kogi State to an opposition party. The forum said it unanimously rejected the candidature of Governor Bello to run for a second term.
