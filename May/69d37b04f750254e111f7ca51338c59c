The Chairman of the Board of Trustees (BOT) of the PDP, Sen. Walid Jibrin, has said he pities Nigerian judges. Sen. Jibrin told Daily Trust in Nasarawa Local Government of Nasarawa State at a public event that, “I pity Nigerian judges who do not participate in elections organised  by politicians but end up hearing both sides, taking notes, having sleepless nights in making reference and later on pass judgements, which later cause different reactions from the public. “I appeal to politicians to always play politics according to the laid down rules for the enhancement of democratic rules and ethics in the country and for judges to be free from recurring political litigations,” he said. Sen. Jibrin then praised the judiciary and especially the judges of the Supreme Court for upholding that the APC did not participate in the elections held in Zamfara State.
