The Executive Secretary of the Federal Government Staff Housing Loans Board (FGSHLB), Dr. Hannatu Adamu Fika, has said 30,258 public servants have benefited from the Federal Housing Loan programme since its inception in 1924. Mrs. Fika said this yesterday in Abuja at a media chat on the scorecard of her 10 years of service and four years of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration. The board before she assumed office in 2009, gave 12,538 public servants loans for over a period of 85 years, while within the last 10 years, under her watch, about 17,720 public servants were given loans. “The board from 1954 till date has given loans to 30,258 beneficiaries. The board has sustainable partnership with private developers for quality affordable social housing for public servants which has led to the commissioning of seven estates in Abuja,” she said. She said the board in order to make obtaining loans more flexible for public servants had removed the provision of collateral before a loan was given. Mrs. Fika said while the board was being given zero allocation in the past, the situation had changed as the board got N80m, N100m, N1bn and now N2bn in the last budgets and in the 2019 budget. She said the board introduced a “buy back” initiative to ease the burden of high interest rate placed on public servants due to the government’s monetisation policy.  30, 258 workers benefit from Federal housing loans -Fika ‘Affordable housing will tackle corruption’ FG receives N1.2bn housing loan for workers Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
