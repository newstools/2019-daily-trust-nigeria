The Chairman of Kwali Area Council of the FCT, Mr Danladi Bomboyi Chiya, has said his administration will be an inclusive one irrespective of political, ethnicity or religious affiliation. Chiya, who received some APC chieftains at his private residence in Kwali yesterday, also said he would ensure he carried those who contested with him during the party’s chairmanship primaries along for the peace, unity and development of the council. He promised that those he would be appointing into his cabinet would be qualified people who would contribute good ideas that would enhance rapid development of the council. “It is obvious that power comes from God and some of my fellow contestants played a very important role in this election and I will make sure my administration carried them along,” he said. He therefore solicited for the support and cooperation of all stakeholders in the area so that the council would witness rapid transformation across all sectors in the area.  ‘My priority will be youth empowerment’ Group declares support for Kwali APC  candidate page 45 Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
