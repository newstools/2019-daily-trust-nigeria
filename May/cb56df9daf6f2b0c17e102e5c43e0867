The Katsina State Governorship Election Tribunal has said it will deliver judgement within the constitutionally stipulated 180 days as it will not condone unnecessary delay strategies on the part of counsels. The gubernatorial candidate of the PDP in the state, Garba Yakubu Lado, had approached the tribunal challenging the victory of Gov. Aminu Bello Masari of the APC. Speaking during its inaugural sitting, the chairperson of the tribunal, Justice Hadiza Ali Jos, said the strategy of delaying proceedings would not work as the tribunal was mandated to deliver judgement on each petition within 180 days. “This means that everyday counts and we have made up our mind that no petition will lapse with the panel,” she assured. She said counsels and stakeholders must ensure justice was done rather than winning a case at all cost, adding that, “We cannot afford to sideline justice for our personal interest.” And for the press, the learned justice said, “You must strictly adhere to ethics, sensational journalism should be avoided; you have a duty to be fair and accurate in reporting the proceedings of the tribunal. “As litigants, please allow us to do our work and stay clear of any attempt to influence us by whatever means. We are determined to do this work with all sense of integrity,’’ she said. The tribunal had received one petition each on the March 9, 2019, governorship and the state assembly elections.
