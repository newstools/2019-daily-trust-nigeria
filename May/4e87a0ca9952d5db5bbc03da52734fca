The Senator representing Sokoto North, Aliyu Wamakko, yesterday, said the petition filed by the PDP candidate in the recent senatorial elections, Sen. Ahmed Mohammed Maccido, against his (Wamakko’s) re-election is “statute barred.” Sen. Wamakko, therefore, urged the election petitions tribunal in Sokoto State to strike out the case instituted by Maccido. Wamakko, who is the first respondent in the case, submitted that the petition was filed out of stipulated time. At the sitting of the tribunal yesterday, Sen. Wamakko’s Counsel, Dr. Hassan Liman (SAN), argued that the petition was filed on the March 18, which he said was outside the 21 days required by law. Jacob Ochidi and Henry Eni-Otu who are counsels to the 2nd Respondent, APC, and 3rd Respondent, INEC, supported the application made by the 1st Respondent to strike out the petition. But Sen. Maccido’s Counsel, Ibrahim Abdullahi, who was opposed to the application, maintained that the petition was filed within stipulated time. Abdullahi said Section 285(5) of the Constitution’s Second Alteration provided that a petition shall be filled within 21 days after the date of declaration of result and contended that the date of declaration of result was not included. Chairman of the tribunal, Justice Peter Akhimie Akhihiero, adjourned the pre-hearing session to Friday, May 10, for continuation.
