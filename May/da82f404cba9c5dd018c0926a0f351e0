The Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) Taraba state branch, Comrade Peter Gambo, has appealed to Gov. Darius Ishaku to ensure speedy compliance with the Federal Government’s directive to pay the approved N30,000 new minimum wage in order to improve the wellbeing of civil servants in the state. Com. Gambo made the plea last week in an interview with newsmen in his office in Jalingo. He expressed optimism that the governor would “no doubt” implement the new national minimum wage, and prayed that there would be no discrimination between state and local government workers in its implementation in the state. He further said it was the law that stipulated payment for governors, members of national and state assemblies that was applicable for payment of state and local government workers. Gambo, therefore, urged Gov. Darius to ensure that the state civil servants and local government council workers benefitted from the new minimum wage as directed by President Muhammadu Buhari. He also advised the state government to pay greater attention on skills acquisition among school children in order to make them self-reliant, and added that when such was done, the problem of unemployment among the youths would be addressed.
