Nasarawa State Governor Umaru Almakura says his administration will pay the fines of some prisoners. Almakura said this yesterday while receiving the new Controller of the Nigerian Prisons Service in the state, Okoro Emmanuel and the governor-elect, Abdullahi Sule. “As my administration gradually winds out, I will visit Lafia prison, settle fines and release prisoners that cannot pay their fines, help decongest the prisons and improve the condition of the prisoners,” he said. Almakura said his successor would equally be a friend to the service and ensure things move better. Emmanuel said the service had seen to the education and wellbeing of inmates.
