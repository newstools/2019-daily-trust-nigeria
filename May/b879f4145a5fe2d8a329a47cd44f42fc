A government source has revealed how the Kano state governor, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, attempted to remove the Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, saying “if not for the quick intervention by Dangote, Ganduje would have dethroned the emir.” The source, who craved anonymity, yesterday disclosed that Emir Sanusi, after sensing trouble at the turn of events between the state government and the palace lately, sent business tycoon, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, to beg the governor to have a change of mind. “I can confidently tell you that when the probe was renewed and the move for creation of four new emirates in the state started, the emir sent the renowned business mogul, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, to Ganduje to plead with him to stop the two moves. “However, Ganduje in his response told Dangote to go back and tell the emir that he should choose from three alternatives: To resign on his own or be removed from office or the government will create additional emirates in the state. “Ganduje assured Dangote that one of the three options must be implemented by government since the emir will not stop playing partisan politics against him. If not for the quick intervention by Dangote, Ganduje would have dethroned the emir,” the source revealed. However, the source added that even though the governor has spared the emir being removed from office, there is likelihood that after the turbaning ceremony of the four new emirs, Ganduje will transfer the emir to another emirate and replace him with one of the newly appointed emirs.
