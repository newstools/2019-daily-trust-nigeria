A United Kingdom-based group, Arise-Nigeria, has said the reappointment of Godwin Emefiele as the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria by President Muhammadu Buhari has silenced critics. The group said the reappointment is an achievement and a statement about Emefiele’s proficiency on the job and the confirmation that President Buhari values proficiency. According to a statement jointly signed by its President, Philip Idaewor and Secretary, Charles Eze, the group averred that Buhari is consolidating on milestones on economy and security to build a giant and stronger Nigeria. “The decision to retain Emefiele as CBN Governor has portrayed President Buhari as an impartial and neutral leader, who is only interested and indeed, recognizes merit and hard work in his appointments rather than sentiments. “His action has shamed and silenced his critics who mendaciously propagate and ascribe his leadership persona as influenced by sectional, tribalistic and religious biases. “The re-appointment of Mr. Godwin Emefiele as the CBN Governor shows how much Mr. President intends to see the fast growth of Nigeria’s economy in the post-recession era and the sustenance of its stability”, the statement read in part.
