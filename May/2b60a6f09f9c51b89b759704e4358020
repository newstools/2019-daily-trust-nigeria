Ahead of his formal inauguration on Wednesday, May 29, for his second term as Governor of Cross River State, Ben Ayade has been called upon to settle down and concentrate on actual governance that will impact and deliver the dividends of democracy to the people of the state. Architect Eyo Ndem Bassey, a former Commissioner for Works and Lands and former Managing Director of Tinapa Business and Leisure, made the call yesterday over a personality dialogue programme on a local radio, Sparkling FM, in Calabar. He said the first term was essentially to enable the governor stamp his feet and engineer the rudiments of his administration, and that he should now relegate party politics and focus on purposeful governance which should make the state stand out. He also called on the people to galvanise support for the governor to enable him execute his programmes and achieve his goals for the goodness of the state. Discouraging undue criticisms and propaganda against Ayadeâ€™s government, he advised Ayade to pursue and sustain people-friendly policies which would raise the peoples trust, hope and sustain their supports for him. On gangsterism which is denting the image of the state, he blamed the system and poor funding of education. He, therefore, advocated for greater educational and job opportunities to enlighten and engage the youths who he said because were idle.
