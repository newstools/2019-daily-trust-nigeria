The Imo State House of Assembly yesterday suspended all theÂ  elected chairmen of the 27 local government areas of the state. This followed the refusal of the chairmen to appear before the house to answer questions on the financial standing of their respective local governments. Member representing Nkwerre Constituency, Chika Madumere, moved the motion for the immediate suspension of the chairmen. According to him, by failing to appear before the lawmakers, the chairmen exhibited lack of respect for, and also undermined the legislature. The house unanimously endorsed the motion.
