Uber said yesterday that riders in Nigeria will now be able to tip their driver after every trip to show appreciation for excellent service delivery. This new tipping feature will be 100% optional and riders will be given optional tip values as well as an option to customise an amount for their driver. General Manager for Uber West Africa, Lola Kassim, in a statement said the tipping features emanated from engagement from driver-partners. She said, “Driving is more than just getting people from point A to B. Every day, driver-partners do their best to make riders lives easier – from getting them to that big business meeting, first date or must-see match – they do it all. This is why improving the driving experience has been a key priority for us over the last few years,” Kassim adds.
