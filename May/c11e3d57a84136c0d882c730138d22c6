The Nigeria Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) has said that Nigeria needs to renegotiate 81 per cent of the 21 bilateral treaties the commission evaluated to better reposition the country to drive and attract more investment. Speaking at a media forum held in Abuja yesterday, the Executive Secretary of NIPC, Ms. Yewande Sadiku, said most of the bilateral treaties evaluated by the commission were not favourable to the country and that this might have effect on the country’s volume of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). The NIPC boss said 17 of the 21 treaties, being 81 per cent, scored less than 10 out of the 20 criteria used for the evaluation, while three were deemed in favour of Nigeria. She said the agreements, which were binding under international law, were negotiated “a very long time ago” with some as far back as 1990. She said the need to renegotiate the bilateral treaties was not different from what the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment had been doing in relation to trade agreements generally. Ms. Yewande also said the NIPC Act was due for review to incorporate modern practices in investment promotion. On the significance of the mandates of the NIPC, she said every $1 spent on investment promotion increased FDI by $189 and every $78 put into investment promotion created one job by a foreign affiliate. She said the commission was compiling a database of investment opportunities in the country which “will improve visibility of investable opportunities in Nigeria.” Last year, the commission tracked a total of $90.90bn investment announcements for Nigeria, being 37 per cent from the value tracked in 2017.
