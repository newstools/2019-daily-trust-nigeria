The former chairman of Kuje Area Council,  Alhaji Abdullahi D. Galadima, has said he will always be available to account for his stewardship in the last three  years. The head of administration of the council, Mr Daniel Ayuba, who presented the handing over notes on behalf of the former chairman to the incoming chairman of the council, Abdullahi Suleiman Sabo, at the secretariat conference hall yesterday, said the incoming chairman has the leverage to go through the document to ascertain how the past administration piloted the affairs of the council. “Distinguished chairman sir, I stand on behalf of the former chairman to present to you the hand over notes. If you are satisfied, you will append your signature. The former chairman said he will be readily available to explain any of his actions in the last three years in office,” he said. “We want to stand with you as staff of Kuje area council and implement all the policies that will bring development to the council,” he added. Responding, the new council chairman, Sabo said he would take his time to study the handing over documents and ask questions where the need arose. He solicited for support and cooperation of the council staff, even as he said his administration would not tolerate truancy and lateness to work.
