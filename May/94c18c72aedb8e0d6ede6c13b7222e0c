The Minister of State for Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, has invited the Aviation Unions to a meeting today to address all issues raised by the workers. The unions early Wednesday morning shut down the Aviation House headquarters of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), preventing workers from gaining access into the premises. The four unions comprising the National Union of Air Transport Employees (NUATE), the Air Transport Services Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (ATSSSAN), Association of Nigeria Aviation Professionals (ANAP) and the National Association of Air Transport Pilots and Employees (NAAPE) are demanding a review of the organisation’s organogram, approval of the new Condition of Service (COS) and inauguration of Boards for the Authority. Mr. Sam Adurogboye, spokesman of the NCAA, in a statement confirmed the planned meeting. However, he said the issues being agitated for by the unions are “not within the jurisdiction of NCAA management.” Therefore, he said the regulatory authority will work with the supervising ministry to ensure that all issues are properly addressed to the satisfaction of all parties. He said the Authority has absolute confidence that the meeting between the Honourable Minister and the unions will provide amicable resolution. The NCAA appealed to all aviation stakeholders “who are not able to access services at our offices today to remain calm as normalcy will soon be restored.” Aviation ministry, unions meet over strike threat BREAKING: Aviation unions declare indefinite strike from Wednesday Strike: FG, aviation workers’ meeting deadlocked Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
