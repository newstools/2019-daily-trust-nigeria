Seplat Petroleum Development Company Plc has denied the  recent publications alleging that Seplat “failed to remit complete dues” on royalty oil, royalty gas, concessional rental and gas flared penalty from 2013 through 2017. The Special Presidential Investigation Panel for the Recovery of Public Property had said  the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company Ltd and one of its Joint Venture partners, Seplat Petroleum Development Company Plc, have short-changed the Federal Government by $1.8bn and N8.8bn from 2013 to 2017. The panel said its year-long investigation revealed that the sums of money represented the royalties on oil and gas, concessional rental and gas flaring penalty due to the Federal Government but which the NPDC and Seplat refused to remit. Responding to a media  inquiry on Sunday, the NPDC, which is the flagship subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, admitted the indebtedness but said it was working towards liquidating it. However, Dr. Chioma Nwachuku – GM, External Affairs & Communications of  Seplat in a statement yesterday said: “Seplat strongly refutes the allegation of non-payment of Gas sale royalty, Oil royalty, Concession rental and Gas flare penalty and confirms that it is up to date on all statutory payments to the Federal Government of Nigeria. Seplat will vigorously defend its position.” Reps tell NPDC to pay $1.5bn royalty debt Seplat becomes first oil firm  listed on stocks market Indigenous oil firms produce 865,000 bpd Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
