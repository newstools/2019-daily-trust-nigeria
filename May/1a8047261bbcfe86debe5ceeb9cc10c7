The Supreme Court has set May 16 for hearing and determination of the appeals over the disqualification of the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidates in Zamfara State in the last general elections. The Governor Abubakar Yari-backed faction of the APC had filed the appeal before the Supreme Court challenging the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Sokoto, which set aside the judgment of the Zamfara High Court recognizing the primary of October 3 and 7, 2018. When the matter was called, counsel to Kabiru Marafa-backed faction of the party, Mike Ozekhome (SAN), sought to move a preliminary objection to the suit in which he contended that the appeal could  not be brought without the lower court or the apex court being a matter of mixed law and facts. But counsel to Yari group, Lateef Fagbemi (SAN), objected to the objection and told the court to order that the objection and the brief of arguments of parties in the matter, including his counter affidavit should be taken together. Thus, the five-member panel of justices presided by Acting CJN, Justice Tanko Muhammad, ordered Ozekhome to regularize his motion to file supplementary record/transfer or records, cross appeal and all the motions in the matter.
