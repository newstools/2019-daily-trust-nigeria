Bauchi State Water and Sewerage Corporation (BSWSC) has engaged Women Groups to help mitigate and address the expected  negative social impact associated with the ongoing Urban Water Supply Expansion  project in communities within Bauchi metropolis and environs. Addressing the women groups in Bauchi, an Environmental and Social Safety Consultant,  Dr. Eyitope Ajayi called on them to bring out the likely negative impact of the proposed water project that may affect the communities. The project is under World Bank Assisted Third National Urban Water Sector Reform Project (NUWSRP3) of which Bauchi State is among beneficiaries. He said that, as mothers and wives, they would likely bear most of the negative social impact of the project  and are in the best position to educate people on it in order to reduce  tension. “This  will enable us capture the fears, apprehensions  and  observations in our report, with a view to addressing them before the commencement of the project in earnest. It is also part of the Environmental Social Management Plan (ESMP), which is also a prerequisite before executing such high profile projects within community circles,” he said.
