The FCT police command has arrested eight suspects in connection with the stabbing to death of  one  Esther Nasikah Okah, at CBN Junction, Anguwar Cement, Karmo Abuja. A statement by the FCT police command spokesman, ASP Danjuma Tanimu Gajere, said the incident happened at about 3:00 am on Sunday. The statement indicated that the unknown assailants attacked the deceased while on her way home after a dinner with friends at Gwarimpa. One of the deceased friends from the dinner, identified as Mr. Gokhan Boyaci, a Turkish national, who resides at  Dutsen Alhaji,  gave the deceased a ride after the dinner and decided to drop her off at Life Camp. The statement further said on reaching Life Camp, the deceased asked to be driven farther to Karimo and while at CBN Junction,  she asked the Turk  to stop so that she could ask for direction to her house. “Three men standing by the road side sighted her bag in the vehicle and as she alighted to ask them questions, one of the men tried to remove the bag, which led to a struggle and she was suddenly stabbed on the neck twice,” Boyaci was quoted as saying. According to the statement, he told the police that he was also stabbed as he attempted to help his friend out of trouble, though he managed to drive to Gwarimpa where they both sought emergency treatment. “It was on arrival at the National Hospital efforts were made to save her but she was confirmed dead,” he said Gajere said the eight suspects arrested in connection with the crime are helping police to unravel the killers.
