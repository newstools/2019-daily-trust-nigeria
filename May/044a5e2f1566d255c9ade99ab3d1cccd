Justice MashudAbass of the Oyo State High Court has granted bail to the Chief Whip of the Oyo State House of Assembly, OlafisoyeAkinmoyede, who was linked with the murder of a member of the House of Representatives,TemitopeOlatoye. Olatoye, who represented theLagelu/Akinyele federal constituency in Ibadan, was shot deadinthe Lalupon area of Lagelu, Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, during the March 9, 2019 governorship election. In his ruling, Justice Abass held that the applicant should be granted bail, with conditions of producing two sureties, one of who must be a blood relation with landed property worth N50 million, and the other a civil servant on, at least, Grade level 14, or a member of the state House of Assembly or National Assembly. The judge, who condemned as “improper” any police arrest of a suspectwithout investigation, said all actions of the police mustbeseen to have justification in law. He directedthat Akinmoyede’s fundamental rightsmust not be restrained by any technicality. “The power of the police to arrest and detain is not in doubt, but the Constitution stipulates that any person detained must be arraigned within 24 hours. “The remand order obtained by the police from an Iyaganku magistrate court had expired since April 4, 2019 and detaining the applicant beyond this period is flagrant disobedience to the Constitution. Obedience of court order should be the responsibility of all who believe in the stability of Nigeria,” he said.
