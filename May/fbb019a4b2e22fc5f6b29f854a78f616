The PDP said yesterday the signing of the N30,000 minimum wage by President Muhammadu Buhari should not be a justification for any form of bullying or victimization of the Nigerian workers. The party in a message by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan on the ocassion of Workers Day celebration, said the APC – led administration must elevate its discourse in understanding that workers’ welfare was not tied to a minimum wage but in creating conducive working environment, established capacity building and reward system among others. “It is, however, unfortunate that at the time Nigerian workers should have been getting ready to enjoy the benefits of a new order under Atiku Abubakar, the nation is being set back by the ills of electoral manipulations. “The PDP nevertheless, urges the Nigerian workers not to be despondent, as the mandate, which was freely given to Atiku Abubakar, will be retrieved at the tribunal,” the statement said.
