The Edo State Election Petitions Tribunal, yesterday, struck out an application filed by Blessing Agbomhere, House of Representatives candidate of the PDP for lack of merit. Agbomhere had filed an application for the recounting of ballot papers used in the February 23, National Assembly election in all the polling units in Etsako Federal Constituency. Abgomhere was challenging the victory of Johnson Oghuma of the APC who emerged winner of the election. Agbomhere, through his Counsel, Chika Adindu, had filed an application urging the court to direct INEC to recount ballot papers used in all polling units, as well as access to ballot papers for the purpose of fingerprint investigation. In his ruling, the tribunal’s Chairman, Justice O. Ogundana, dismissed the application for lack of merit. Justice Ogundara said there was no provision in the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) that provided for recount after declaration of result and as such recounting and fingerprint assessment had no correlation with errors or miscalculation in collation. He, however, fixed June 11, for commencement of substantive hearing.
