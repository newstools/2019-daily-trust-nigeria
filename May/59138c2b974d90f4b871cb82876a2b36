Some residents of Keffi Local Government, Nasarawa State, on Wednesday decried the hike in the prices of some food items in the month of Ramadan. A resident, Alhaji Umar Mohammad, expressed concern on the development which he descried as an “ugly situation” in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). He said that the increase had been drastic in the past three days thereby causing the people untold hardship. Another resident, Mr Safiyanu Idris, also said that the prices of pepper, tomato, okro and other related items had increased drastically. Idris, who decried the economic hardship now confronting people, called on the government at all levels to help cushion the effects of the hike in the prices of food items. Some food sellers, who spoke with NAN, argued that the price increase was not their fault, saying that they operated according to the market forces. Laurat Bako said that traders could only sell according to how they bought the items instead of selling at a loss. Barau Arzika, an Irish potatoes seller, said it was totally against his wish to raise the price of potatoes, adding that it was inevitable due to the increase from where he buys. Arzika appealed to the government to address the hike in the prices of these essential commodities in order to reduce the suffering of the people during the Ramadan fast.
