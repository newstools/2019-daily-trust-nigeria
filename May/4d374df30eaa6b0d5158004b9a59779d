Veteran journalist, Mr. Dan Agbese, has commended the Lagos State governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode, for his commitment towards transforming the infrastructural landscape in the state in the last four years. Agbese, who spoke at the 2019 biennial convention of the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), held at the Airport Hotel in Ikeja, Lagos, at the weekend, said he was particularly pleased with the infrastructural regeneration of the Muritala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) road. The dilapidated MMIA road obeying reconstructed into a 10-lane super highway by the Ambode administration and was commissioned last month by President Muhammadu Buhari, alongside other major projects. According to Agbese, the quality of work on the MMIA road was “top notch”, saying that the governor deserved a special title for the feat. “I must commend the Lagos State governor for the quality of work on the International Airport Road. If he was in Imo State, he would have been tagged a chief of high tech roads. In fact, he would be titled the High Tech Road Builder One of Lagos,” Agbese said.
