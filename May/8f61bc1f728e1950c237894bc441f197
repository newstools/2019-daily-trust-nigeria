Motion for the creation of four additional emirates in Kano State has scaled first reading at the Kano State House of Assembly. It would be recalled that the state assembly had, yesterday, commenced a move for the creation of Gaya, Rano, Bichi and Karaye emirates. At todayâ€™s plenary, the house received a joint committee report of the House Standing Committees on Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs and that of Judiciary in respect of a petition to upgrade some traditional rulers to the status of 1st class emirs. The implication of creating additional emirates is that the powers of the present Emir of Kano, Malam Muhammad Sanusi ll, will be reduced. The four proposed emirates are presently being headed by district heads and if upgraded, will have emirs as heads.
