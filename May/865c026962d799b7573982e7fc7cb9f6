The new policy of the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) that seeks to grant Local Government Areas financial autonomy will end diversion of local government funds by state governors. The Chief Executive and Founder of Connected Development (CODE), an anti-corruption Civil Society Organisation (CSO), Hamzat Lawal, said the policy would cater for the welfare of the people at the grassroots level who were marginalised and discounted because funds meant for the development of their communities were diverted. NFIU recently released guidelines barring financial institutions from allowing transactions from State Joint Local Government Accounts (SJLGA) without funds first reaching the local governments’ accounts, strengthening the financial autonomy of the LGAs. Lawal said for years, federal and state governments had maintained great influence and control over local governments, leaving room for embezzlement, mismanagement and financial leakages, denying LGAs the chance to make significant development impact and bring governance closer to the people at the grassroots. He further said the NFIU policy as a development in governance was an opportunity for the 9th National Assembly to make a historic mark in Nigeria’s democracy by passing the law that enhanced local government autonomy.
