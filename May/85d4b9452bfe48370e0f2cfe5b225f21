Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State has appealed to the Catholic Church to call to order all his opponents that wrote petitions challenging his election. Ayade said he wanted the church to call a meeting so that those challenging his victory would attend considering that all of them were members of the Catholic Church. He said this yesterday  at the preinaugural thanksgiving service of his second  term which was held at St. Charles’s Lwanga Catholic Church in Calabar. “The main contending parties at the (election) tribunal are Catholics and I believe that the leadership of the Catholic Church in the state has a duty to call us to a round table to settle the case,” he said. “For me as a Catholic, I have extended my hand of fellowship and will never bear any grudge against anyone for whatever reason arising from the election or any other matter,” he said. Ayade also called on his opponents to toe the path of   politicians in Enugu State who he said withdrew their cases  against the governor because they all belonged to the same Christian faith. He  pledged to work harder in his second term in office in his bid to ensure “total transformation of the socio-economic landscape of the state.” Ayade sad over demise of APC chairman Catholic priest apologises to  Nsukka diocese, Ibenda community Catholic church wants back schools in good shape Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
