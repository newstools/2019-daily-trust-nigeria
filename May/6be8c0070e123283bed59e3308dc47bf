The Nigerian Army has said troops of 1 Division Kaduna raided a banditâ€™s hideout at Gonan Bature East of Rijana and Kasarami farmhouse in Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna state. Army spokesman, Colonel Sagir Musa, who made this known in a statement late Wednesday night said the raid followed credible intelligence from a Good Samaritan. He explained that the abandoned Kasarami farmhouse was reportedly forcefully occupied by criminals and had been used as a shelter and a place where victims of kidnapping were kept. He said during the raid, contact was made with the hoodlums with fierce exchange of fire that led to the extermination of two bandits. He said items recovered are; two AK 47 Rifles, two AK 47 Magazines, 51 rounds of 7.62 mm Special ammunition and two techno cell phones. He said the Nigerian Army is committed to protecting life and property of all Nigerians, adding that it is using this medium to thank the Good Samaritan for providing the information that resulted in the successful raid operation. He said the Army will continue to sensitize and also request members of the public to support it and other security agencies in their efforts to checkmate terrorism, banditry and other assorted crimes in Nigeria.
