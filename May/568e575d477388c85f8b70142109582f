The Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, has unveiled the second phase of TraderMoni and MarketMoni in Awka and Onitsha in Anambra State. The schemes were launched in both Eke Awka in Awka South Local Government Area and Ochanja Market in Onitsha as beneficiaries acknowledged the receipt of funds ranging from N10,000 for TraderMoni and N50,000 for MarketMoni. The Executive Director of Micro Enterprises of the Bank of Industry (BoI), Mrs. Toyin Adeniji, said the unveiling of the second phase was to sustain continued effort to meet the primary objective of “broadening financial inclusion and increasing access to affordable credit for traders and small business owners.” Mrs. Adeniji said, “This phase will target at least 2,000 new TraderMoni and MarketMoni beneficiaries. This is in addition to the over 30,000 TraderMoni and 4,000 plus MarketMoni beneficiaries that received the GEEP loans in the first phase between 2017 and 2018. Prior to this official market activation, 200 new MarketMoni beneficiaries had been recorded in the state. The second phase will also target traders for the N15,000 Next Level TraderMoni loans for traders who have repaid the first N10,000 loan.” Some of the beneficiaries said the money would help them to buy more wares and also enhance their profit margin thereby improving the standard of living of their families. One of the beneficiaries of TraderMoni, Mrs. Ujunwa Okonkwo, who hawks detergents in a wheel barrow in Eke Awka, said, “I have been doing this business for three years now. My wares would have grown bigger than this; it is from here that I feed my two children. Now that the Federal Government has helped me with money, I am sure that I can do better. I am happy that people like us can still be remembered by the Federal Government. Osinbajo who was in the company of Gov. Willie Obiano and Mrs. Toyin Adeniji, moved round the market to interact with the beneficiaries. He said if the government adjusted electricity tariff and yielded to the call to remove subsidy, inflation would go up by 2.5 per cent.
