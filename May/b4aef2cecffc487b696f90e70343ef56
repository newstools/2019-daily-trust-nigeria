Hundreds of Kano residents yesterday welcomed the Emir of Kano, Malam Muhammad Sanusi II,  who returned to the state from Saudi Arabia where he had performed lesser hajj. Sanusi arrived at Malam Aminu Kano International Airport, Kano, at 4.25pm and was received by his senior council members and residents. Accompanied by the crowd, Sanusi spent an hour before he could reach his palace. Among the senior council members that received at the airport were Makama Kano district head of Wudil, Alhaji Abdullahi Sarki Ibrahim; the district head of Doguwa, Alhaji Aliyu Harazimi; Dan Isan Kano and district head of Warawa, Alhaji Kabiru Tijjani Hashim; among others. While he was away from the country, the state government created four additional emirates for Gaya, Rano, Bichi and Karaye, all of which used to be under the Kano Emirate.
