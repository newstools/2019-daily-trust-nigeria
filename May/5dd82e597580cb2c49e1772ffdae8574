The Caretaker Committee of the APC in Ogun State has said that the Governor-elect, Prince Dapo Abiodun, will review last-minute employments and contracts awarded by the outgoing Governor, Sen. Ibikunle Amosun, when he takes over power on May 29. In a statement made available to Daily Trust in Abeokuta by the committee’s Publicity Secretary, Tunde Oladunjoye, the party vowed that the review would also be extended to the installation of new traditional rulers. Our correspondent recalls that the governor had last week announced recruitment of 1,000 people into the civil service. Amosun, however, explained that the employment followed due process as the beneficiaries were picked from over 5,000 applicants who sat for a recruitment test over a year ago. But, Oladunjoye said it was “morally unacceptable” for Amosun to embark on mass appointments and promotions, “without due consideration to the governor-elect” barely a month to the expiration of his tenure.
