Two armed robbery suspects, Obinna Alozie and Obinna Machu, who the police command in Lagos State described as “notorious criminals”, have been arrested allegedly while attacking residents of the Festac Town in the state. The police said that Alozie and Machu and their gang had been terrorising FESTAC and Agboju residents for a long time. The suspects were said to have embarked on a robbery operation at Festac Town and Agboju on May 10, 2019, robbing one apartment after another. It was learnt that luck, however, ran out against them when witnesses of an attack on some victims along 21 Road, Festac Town raised an alarm. The Lagos State police spokesman, Bala Elkana, who confirmed the arrest, said that the two suspects had been on the police wanted list for some time. “One locally made pistol with ammunition and other dangerous weapons were recovered from Alozie, 21, of  No. 19, Ogogoro Junction, Iyana Iba, and Machu, 27, of No. 10, Canal Road, Ajegunle, when they were arrested. Investigation is ongoing and the suspects will soon be charged to court,” Elkana said.   2 killed in Lagos bank robbery Soldiers shoot 2 policemen, kill civilian in Lagos 2 kidnap kingpins arrested in Lagos Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
