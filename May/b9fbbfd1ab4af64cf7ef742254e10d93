Security has been beefed up within and out the premises of the Kano State House of Assembly today. Daily Trust observed the presence of heavily armed security personnel within and outside the premises of the Assembly complex. Armed security personnel comprising Police and Civil Defence corps are stationed at various junctions leading to the Assembly complex. Vehicular movement is restricted around the assembly complex as the security agents conduct thorough checks on vehicles before allowing them access to the assembly. Also, at the main entrance of the assembly, only screened persons are being allowed to enter into the building. The development, our reporter observed, might not be unconnected with todayâ€™s plenary where the House Committee on Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs is expected to submit its report on the amendment of Emirate Council Law 1984.
