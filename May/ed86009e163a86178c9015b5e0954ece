The Nigeria’s transport sector will move from its current state to a level where it can compete globally through holistic implementation of the National Integrated Infrastructure Master Plan (NIIMP). President/Chairman of Council, Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN), Dr. Uche Olowu stated this in a lecture titled, “Financing the transport/allied industry: Stock taking and paving the way forward.” It was delivered at the Nigeria Transport Lecture/Awards held recently by the Transport Day Newspaper. Olowu said public private partnership was the way to go in growing the nation’s transport infrastructure. He said there was nothing wrong with securing loans from China but the terms of the loan must be spelt out. Daily Trust reports that the China Exim Bank is currently funding some transport projects mostly railway in Nigeria.
