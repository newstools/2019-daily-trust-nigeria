The chief Imam of Yobe State University Damaturu, Dr Yahuza Abubakar Hamza, has cautioned business owners against inflating price of goods during Ramadhan fast period. The Chief Imam made the call at a pre-Ramadhan lecture organised by Nigeria Television Authority (NTA) in Damaturu, on Thursday. Hamza described that attitude of the traders of increasing the price to make more profit as ‘wicked’, saying it was high time that traders feared God and refrained from the unholy act. He said as Muslims, people should remain obedient to Allah, move away completely from sins and give food and alms to the needy and reap the complete reward in Ramadhan. “Ramadhan is a rare month given to Muslims by God to reap greater reward from Allah and not His wrath. Therefore, we should take this advantage to feed and cater for the orphans, widows, poor and all the needy,” he said. The Chief Imam also called for improved system of alms distribution to ensure that those in dire need of assistance are the actual beneficiaries. The cleric admonished Muslims Ummah to reduce the time they spend watching TV, social media chats and to dedicate more to reading the Holy Qur’an and repentance. Also speaking, Sheikh Mohammad Sani Nguru, advised fasting Muslims against wasting their time on arguments that could lead to conflict. “If someone wants to argue with you, tell him that you are fasting, and a fasting Muslim is supposed to be morally upright,” he said. He also stressed the importance of breaking fast with dates, saying it clears blocked arteries and provides needed energy to the body system.
