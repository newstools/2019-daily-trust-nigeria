Ahead of the November 16, governorship election in Bayelsa State, artisans and technicians at the Mechanic Village in Yenagoa under the aegis of Paulker Motive Force (PMF) have called on the Senator representing Bayelsa Central, Emmanuel Paulker, to join the governorship race on the platform of the PDP. The group, during a procession in Yenagoa, also promised to contribute for the purchase of forms for the senator. The group’s Coordinator, Mr. Frank Madumere, said if Paulker was given opportunity to rule, he would develop the state to be one of the strongest economies in the country. He said, ‘’We are inspired by Paulker’s development-oriented projects across Bayelsa State, that is why PMF deems it necessary to call on him to contest the 2019 governorship poll for people to experience a glorious rebirth,” he said.
