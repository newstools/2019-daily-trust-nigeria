The North Central Advocacy Group on Wednesday endorsed the candidature of Sen Mohammed Danjuma Goje for the office of the Senate President in the incoming 9th Senate. The group said Goje is the right man for the job considering his experience in both Executive and the Legislature as a former two-term governor of Gombe State and a third term senator. The North Central group said it took the decision after a meeting held at the J S Tarka Foundation Makurdi, Benue State, noting that of all the candidates for the position, Goje stood out. This is coming after many other groups had called on Goje to vie for the position. “As a former governor of Gombe State, a three term senator, former minister and presently chairman senate committee on appropriations is eminently qualified to man the office of Senate President,” convener of the group, Inalegwu Ejembi, said in a statement. The group said Goje should not waste time in declaring for the position, saying they did not support any imposition of candidate for the office. “Nigeria has passed the stage where someone will sit somewhere and handpick people to be leaders of the National Assembly. “The legislature is an independent body and as such, the lawmakers should be allowed to elect their leaders based on their convictions,” the convener said. 9th Senate Presidency Race: Why Danjuma Goje is the man to beat Senate presidency: N’East groups storm NASS, drum support for Goje Senate Presidency: Goje’s imminent entry brings new twist Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
