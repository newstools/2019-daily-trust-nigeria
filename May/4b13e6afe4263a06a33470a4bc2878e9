North Korea has fired two short-range missiles in its second weapons test in less than a week, the South Korean military says. The missiles fired from the city of Kusong travelled 420km and 270km towards the east. The tests come as a top US envoy is in South Korea for talks on how to break the deadlock over nuclear negotiations. Analysts say the North is trying to increase pressure on the US over its failure to make concessions. A meeting in Vietnam between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump ended without agreement in February with the US insisting North Korea give up its nuclear programme and Pyongyang demanding sanctions relief. The two missiles were fired at about 16:30 local time (07:30 GMT) and reached an altitude of about 50km before falling into the sea, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.
