Ahead of the expiration of his first tenure, outgoing Governor of Lagos State, Akinwunmi Ambode, said yesterday that he is wiser now. Ambode, who could not secure the governorship ticket of the APC, stated this shortly after meeting President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja. He is set to handover to Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu who secured the backing of Sen. Bola Tinubu to pick the APC ticket and won the gubernatorial election. “Every politician learns every day. The mere fact remains that I came in as a technocrat, so I used to call myself a techno-politician and I think I am wiser now, I’m more of a politician than a technocrat,” he said. He said he was grateful to God for the opportunity to govern Lagos State in the past four years. “I have a few days in office, may be 16 days or so to leave office, but what is most important is that I was able to have that opportunity from God to be elected as Governor of Lagos, and also to touch humanity in a way that I deem it fit. “We did our best and most of all our projects and the things we did in Lagos are more or less people-friendly and people-centric, and I just think that a lot more people have enjoyed the benefits and the dividends of democracy than we actually met it and that gives me joy,” he said. He said he was in the State House to thank President Buhari for undertaking a state visit to Lagos a few weeks ago where he inaugurated projects executed by him.
