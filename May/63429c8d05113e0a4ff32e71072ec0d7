The National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency, NESREA, has sealed one of the facilities of a Chinese company, Kwo Chief Investment Limited, located at Obimo in Nsukka Local Government Area of Enugu State for illegal production and exportation of charcoal in Nigeria. A statement from the agency said the matter will be charged to court shortly. “Investigations showed that the company was operating illegal charcoal production facilities at Ikem and Obimo in Isi-Uzo and Nsukka local government areas of Enugu State without permit. This runs contrary to the provisions of the National Environmental (Control of Charcoal Production Export) Regulations 2014,” the statement said. According to the statement, there was a ban on production of charcoal for export in Nigeria, but local commercial production is allowed within the ambit of the law. The Regulation states that “a person shall not undertake or engage in any undertaking or activity relating to commercial charcoal production or handling without a valid permit issued by the Federal or State Department of Forestry”.
