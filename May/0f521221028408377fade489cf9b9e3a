Governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo State, yesterday, lamented the closure of the state accounts in some banks by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for the past three months. Okorocha cried out during the commissioning of some projects in the state by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo who represented President Muhammadu Buhari. The Imo governor said the action of the anti- graft agency had crippled the activities of his administration. He said despite his laudable achievements in the state, his detractors were still bent on rubbishing his accomplishments. Acting Chairman of EFCC, Ibrahim Magu, had earlier in the week confirmed that Okorocha and other were under investigation. The Imo governor said he had more than 1,000 projects to his credit, adding that if he were to commission all the projects, he won’t be able to so do in one year. According to him, he had been unjustly treated by the ruling APC he devoted his life and energy to, stressing that the height of it was the denial of his certificate of return by INEC. Speaking after commissioning some projects, Osinbajo said Okorocha’s achievements in Imo showed that states could accomplish much without recourse to the Federal Government. Among the projects commissioned were the Imo Cargo International Airport, the ultra -modern new police headquarters and the Mother and Child Hospital. The vice was in Owerri earlier in the week where he also commissioned some projects.
