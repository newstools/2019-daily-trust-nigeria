The National Financial Secretary of APGA, Ibrahim Garba Carefor, has said the party’s National Chairman, Chief Victor Oye, deserves another term in office given his leadership qualities that helped in extending electoral victory for the party to other parts of the country. Carefor, in a chat with Daily Trust in Katsina, said APGA under Oye’s leadership was gaining national ground and that this feat was never achieved since the inception of the party. He said the recent calls by some misguided individuals for Oye to resign was uncalled for and out of place, saying APGA under the current chairman never had it so good.
