The Presidential Committee on the North-East Initiative (PCNI) has flagged off the distribution of educational and instructional materials to primary and secondary schools in North-East geo-political zone. Speaking shortly after flagging off the distribution over the week in Gombe, the Vice Chairman of the committee, Alhaji Tijjani Tumsa, said 67, 500 students across Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Taraba and Yobe states would benefit from the gesture. Tumsa said over N800 million was spent to purchase the items, which he said was aimed at impacting on the children of the geo-political zone who are at the bottom of educational indices. “The materials would impact positively on the education of children in the Northeast sub-region, which has the highest number of out-of-school children in Nigeria, courtesy of about 10 years of insurgency by Boko Haram,” Tumsa said. He explained that the civil society organisations, the states government, parent-teacher-associations and other relevant stakeholders would monitor and evaluate the impact of the intervention. The vice chairman added that such stakeholders in education sector in the affected states are expected to identify schools that would benefit from the instructional materials. Receiving the items on behalf of Gombe State, the Commissioner for Education, Alhaji Isiaku Abdullahi , said the measure was a welcome development that would impact positively on the education sector in the state. He commended PCNI for the intervention and assured that the items would be utilised for the purpose intended. The Chairman of the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), Professor Mohammed Gurama while commending the PCNI for the gesture, said the SUBEB had benefited from PCNI in the area of teachers’ training.
