Renaissance coalition in collaboration with civil society organisations and other stakeholders in Kano state, have called on his Eminence the Sultan of Sokoto being the leader of the Danfodio caliphate to denounce in strong terms the creation of additional emirates in Kano saying that the process was done without consultation with major stakeholders and following due process. This was contained in a position statement read on behalf of the coalition at a press conference on the unfortunate emerging issues in Kano by comrade Abdullahi Baffa Yola. According to the statement, the coalition was alarmed by the current administration’s increasing disregard for due process, exhibiting a culture of impunity; ignoring court orders among other issues. “We are alarmed by the current administration’s increasing disregard for due process, exhibiting a culture of impunity; ignoring court orders while people who have tried to broker peace suffered all sorts of indignities, threats and intimidation in an environment that is increasingly treading the path to a full-blown political dictatorship enabling thugs and bandits to operate freely with audacity thus creating an atmosphere of tyranny and violence,” it stated. The coalition also demands for government to recognize the preeminent position and crucial role that the Kano emirate has played for centuries and continues to play in the welfare of the people as arbiter, platform for social mobilization thereby scraping the newly created emirates. It also revealed that, the newly created emirates will only serve as a source of division and capable of destroying the monolithic identity which gives Kano people a strong sense of stability and inspires others as well.
