Sri Lanka has imposed a nationwide curfew for the second night in a row after a wave of anti-Muslim violence in the wake of the Easter bombings. A Muslim man was stabbed to death while rioters torched Muslim-owned shops and vandalised mosques during Monday’s attacks. Police have arrested 60 people, including the leader of a far-right Buddhist group. The United Nations has called for calm and a “rejection of hate”. A nationwide curfew, declared for the second night running, took effect at 15:30 GMT on Tuesday. The North-Western province, where the worst violence flared, will be shut down for longer, police said. Rioting there, north of the capital Colombo, saw police fire bullets into the air to disperse mobs in several towns. Tensions have been high since Islamist militants attacked churches and hotels three weeks ago on Easter Sunday, killing more than 250 people.
