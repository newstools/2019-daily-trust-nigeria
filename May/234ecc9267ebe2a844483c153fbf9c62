The Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Dr Usani Usani, has inaugurated the completed 6.55 kilometers Atimbo – Akpabuyo road constructed by his ministry. Speaking during the inauguration in Calabar, Usani said the Atimbo – Akpabuyo road links Calabar to Bakassi Local Government Area through Akpabuyo Local Government Area and was constructed by two contractors simultaneously for quick completion. The minister said the rehabilitation of the road was imperative in order to ease the suffering of the people who constantly use it. According him, the plan of the present administration was that every local government in the nine Niger Delta states have, at least, one project. “As the Federal Government goes on to intervene in different areas, I wish we all understand that there is a limit to which it can intervene in all sectors of our public lives. “Constitutionally, there are provisions for exclusive list items and concurrent list items which means every tier of government-federal, state and local, has its own responsibility. “As you urge us to do more, l also urge you to urge the state, LGAs and private sector to carry out their own commitments because we are all supposed to be partners in progress,” he said. Similarly, the Paramount Ruler of Calabar Municipal, Dr Patrick Inok, lauded the efforts of the minister for the rehabilitation of the road, saying this was what was expected from a seasoned bureaucrat.
