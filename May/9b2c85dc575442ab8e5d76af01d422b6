Following the verdict given by the Appeal Court in Abuja on Thursday, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, candidate Ademola Adeleke has said he’ll be heading to the Supreme court to seek redress.  In a statement in Osogbo, the PDP candidate said he received the news of the Appeal Court judgement with dissatisfaction. He said “I’m heading to Supreme Court”  Speaking further, he added “I have subsequently instructed my counsel to prepare for an appeal against the judgement.”  Adeleke said the judgement of the Appeal Court relied on weak technical foundation. He said the substantive issue which formed the basis of the lower tribunal judgement was relegated to the background.  “We are reviewing the full ruling and action has already commenced to appeal the judgement and ensure the eventual retrieval of the stolen mandate”, Adeleke said.
