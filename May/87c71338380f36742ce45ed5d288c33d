The Chairman of the Solid Minerals Development Fund (SMDF), Alhaji Uba Saidu Malami, has called for renewed hope in the solid minerals sector because of the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari. In a chat with newsmen recently, Malami said President Buhariâ€™s re-election could only bring about the much-desired sector policy stability needed to grow Nigeria into a global mining destination. He urged investors and other stakeholders to take advantage of the policy and continuity in programmes to invest in the sector. He further urged the mining investment community to take advantage of several of the existing sector specific incentives and join forces with the government to grow the country. He assured the investors and stakeholders of a fully reinvigorated SMDF which would actively support the sector with proactive programmes, collaborations and engagement of local and international stakeholders. The SMDF which he said at this time would be marking its mid-term milestone, would be issuing a mid-term report in which the challenges of the first half, as well as the mapping out of new strategies to improve the funding mechanisms would be addressed. He commended the effort of the SMDF management team led by Hajia Fatima Shinkafi which has continued to place the fund as a priority organisation in the current administration.
