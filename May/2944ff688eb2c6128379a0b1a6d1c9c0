The Governor of Borno State, Alhaji Kashim Shettima, says he cannot side with either Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje or the Emir, Muhammad Sanusi II, over the creation of new emirates. The governor, responding to questions from newsmen after the Northern States Governors Forum  meeting in Kaduna yesterday, said he could never have spoken in support of the split of the Kano emirate or against the governor because he had special relationships with both Ganduje and Sanusi. He said the context of a remark he earlier made on the issue was completely changed. “Fact is, Governor Ganduje has adopted and granted lifetime scholarships from primary to university levels to 200 orphans from Borno State whose parents were killed by Boko Haram. On the other hand, the Emir of Kano was our main link to Alhaji Aliko Dangote. In 20016, the emir was in Borno and on seeing the humanitarian situation, he spoke to Alhaji Aliko Dangote and Dangote has been to Borno State more than three times,” he said.
