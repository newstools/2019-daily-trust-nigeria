The policies and programmes embarked upon by the Muhammad Buhari administration since 2015 have revived the solid mineral sector and taken it to the next level, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development Abubakar Bawa Bwari has said. Alhaji Bawa Bwari said the present government met a sector that was moribund due to neglect and poor funding, ‘’and through deliberate efforts, we have now revived it to make our mining environment competitive again.’’ The minister stated this in his speech at the commissioning of completed Research Development Projects at the National Metallurgical Development Centre (NMDC) in Jos. The speech was emailed to Daily Trust yesterday. He said as regulators, the federal government would provide the enabling environment for operators to thrive while also attracting new investors into the sector.  He said in order to accomplish this, the ministry and its agencies must be equipped with the tools that will make them perform their roles adequately hence the commissioning of the projects. Amongst completed projects commissioned by the minister is the Installation of Microwave Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometer (MP-AES) which is a state-of-the-art analytical equipment for the conduct of research work necessary for the development of the minerals sector in Nigeria.  With the acquisition of this equipment, he said the ministry has further enhanced the centre’s capacity to contribute significantly to the diversification of the economy through the minerals sector, using environmental best practices.  ‘Mining sector can become the largest employer  of labour’ – Minister NGSA commissions rigs to boost mining activities Nigeria is still a greenfield with 44 mineral types - Minister Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
