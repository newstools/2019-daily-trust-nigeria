The Plateau State government yesterday said the bidding process for the reconstruction of Jos Main Market is open to any competent firm interested in the job. The governor, Simon Bako Lalong, stated this after supervising the demolition of weak areas of the dilapidated market structure which was engulfed in a fire incident 17 years ago. Lalong said his administration was determined to complete the reconstruction work and that funds for the work had been made available in the 2019 budget. The demolition was carried out by Mamco Wreckers Consortium, explosive experts from South Africa. The company had last week stated that tonnes of explosives had been deployed according to work plans to ensure a safety and efficient exercise. The 34-year-old multi-billion naira Jos Main Market structure, once referred to as the largest indoor market in West Africa, was forced to close down after a fire incident in 2002. Since then, no government made attempts to rebuild the market until the incumbent governor, Simon Bako Lalong.
