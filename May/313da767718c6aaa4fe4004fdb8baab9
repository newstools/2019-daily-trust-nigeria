A former Abia State Governor and Senator-elect (Abia North), Dr. Orji Kalu, yesterday, urged Nigerians to sustain their support for the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government. Dr. Kalu said the second term of the incumbent administration would be used to consolidate on the achievements of the first term. In a statement, Kalu appreciated Nigerians for voting en masse for President Buhari. He also said the APC was becoming increasingly popular in the South East and urged the party’s leadership to consider Ndigbo for key appointments in all arms of government. Daily Trust reports that apart from Kalu, the APC also produced one Senator in Imo, Benjamin Uwajumogu (Imo North), while the seat contested by outgoing Gov. Rochas Okorocha is yet to be decided.
