The acting Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, is set to host West African Police and Security Chiefs (WAPCCO) in Abuja. A statement on Monday from Police spokesman, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Frank Mba, said the meeting is part of galvanizing multinational efforts toward finding a lasting solution to transnational crimes, especially terrorism, violent extremism, kidnapping, illicit circulation of small arms and light weapons. He said the meeting is also to deliberate on the menace of human trafficking, maritime security, herders and farmersâ€™ conflict, amongst others. He said the event is expected to have in attendance the INTERPOL Secretary General, representatives of African Union Mechanism for Police Cooperation (AFRIPOL), members of the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) in South Africa and representatives from Committee of Chiefs of Police from Central Africa. He said the meeting will present an opportunity for all Security Chiefs across West Africa to re-commit themselves to collaborate more effectively towards tackling trans-border crimes and other regional security threats in an increasingly globalized world. He said the West African Police Chiefs Committee (WAPCCO) is a structure under ECOWAS designed to bring together Heads of Police of ECOWAS Member States to exchange and share intelligence and collaborate with one another in the fight against criminality and security threats in West Africa.
