The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has said that the outgoing 8th House under his leadership gave President Muhammadu Buhari’s government maximum support and cooperation. Dogara who disclosed this in Abuja yesterday when he received the Euro Knowledge Award for exemplary leadership, explained that such support consisted of‎ speedy consideration and passage of various requests from the president by the lawmakers. Chairman of the House Committee on Ethics and Privileges, Ossai Nicholas (PDP, Delta), who received the award on behalf of the speaker, said Dogara was found worthy of the award because of the great impact of laws passed by the 8th House under him. The award was also in recognition of the speaker’s contribution to the passage of the Ease of Doing Business in Nigeria Bill. Such pieces of legislation, he added, helped to fast-track the implementation of government’s various policies and ‎programmes. He described the 8th House of Representatives as the best-performing in Nigeria’s legislative history since 1960 and that there were times the House had to pass executive bills within two legislative days or a week.
