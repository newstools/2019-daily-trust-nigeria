Mozambique requires urgent life-saving relief to deal with the destructive aftermath of Cyclone Kenneth, an aid organisation has said. Save the Children says the humanitarian situation is significant and life-threatening and more funds are needed. The UN gave Mozambique and Comoros Island $13m (Â£10m) for food, water and repair of infrastructure. The death toll in cyclone-hit northern Mozambique is 38, but is expected to rise, officials say. Meanwhile aid workers are scrambling to reach the areas that were worse hit by the cyclone. The storm struck the southern African nation last week with winds of 220km/h, flattening villages and damaging thousands more homes.
