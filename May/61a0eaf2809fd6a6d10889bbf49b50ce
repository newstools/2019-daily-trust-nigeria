The Nasarawa State Governor-elect, Engr. Abdullahi Sule, has said that only competent politicians will be appointed in his cabinet. He told Daily Trust in Lafia that he was ready for the task ahead and would work with competent people. “I want to hit the ground running and the best way to do it is to appoint competent people; whether politicians or not, to move Nasarawa State to the next level of development given its vast natural and human resources,” he said. According to him, governance was all about giving priority to those who could deliver the assignment given to them and not just those within the corridors of power. Engr. Sule said he was willing to continue with the good legacies of the outgoing administration of Gov. Umaru Al- Makura in developing farmers in the state to move from subsistence to commercial through the introduction of modern farming techniques. The incoming governor said he wanted to prioritise human development given the number of able youths in the state who should be self-employed and employers of labour. He, therefore, called on the people to abide by the law in all their activities for even development of the state and to woo investors from within and outside Nigeria.
