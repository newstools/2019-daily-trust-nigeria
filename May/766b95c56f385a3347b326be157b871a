The House of Representatives yesterday passed the South East Development Commission Bill for second reading, in concurrence with the Senate. Deputy Speaker, Yusuf Lasun (APC, Osun), who presided the plenary, announced the passage on the floor of the House after a unanimous majority yes votes by the lawmakers. In a heated debate prior to the passage, lawmakers from South Eastern states had lamented how the zone was being marginalized in the country, especially with regard to development. Nicholas Ossai (PDP, Delta), noted that every part of South East has been ravaged by gully erosion, aside the destruction caused by the civil war, adding that the commission would help carry every section of the country along. Nkiruika Onyejeocha (APC, Abia) and Linda Ukeje (PDP, Abia) argued that the bill was long overdue considering the long neglect of the South East region of Nigeria. Recall that the Senate had earlier passed the bill, after which it was referred to the House for concurrence.
