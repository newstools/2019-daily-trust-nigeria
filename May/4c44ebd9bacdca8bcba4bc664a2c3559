The Kano State Election Petitions Tribunal has granted the PDP’s prayer to be allowed to make photocopies of the election materials used in the conduct of the gubernatorial election in the state. The prayer, filed by Maliki Kuliyah Umar who is counsel to PDP and its gubernatorial candidate, Abba Kabiru Yusuf, sought the tribunal to allow an extension of period for access and photocopying of election materials as contained in a motion on notice before the tribunal. In a ruling, the Justice Halima Shamaki-led tribunal ordered INEC to grant PDP permission to inspect the electoral materials and make photocopies as requested. The tribunal ordered INEC to allow the inspection of the election materials in the presence of all the parties in the suit. However, Counsel to Gov. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and the APC, Aliyu Umar (SAN), challenged the tribunal’s jurisdiction in granting PDP’s prayers to photocopy and scan the electoral materials by referring to Section 151 Subsection 5 of the Electoral Act 2010, stating that the court was only empowered to grant access. Umar, therefore, called for outright dismissal of PDP’s application. However, the tribunal directed the parties to commence execution of the inspection and photocopying of the electioneering materials, and further directed both parties to agree on a date for continuation of the hearing and communicate to it.
