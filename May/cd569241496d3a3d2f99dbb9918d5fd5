The Director of APC Women and Youth Presidential Campaign Team, Dr Wole Aboderin has commended women and youth who contributed to the party’s victory and assured them that the political structures they built to ensure such feat will be maintained. He said it is in the interest of the APC that the Women and Youth Presidential Campaign structures across the nation are remodelled as a key structure of the party against future elections. “This structure if maintained, would vigorously champion the manifesto of our party as Change agents, build ideas necessary in promoting the nation’s socio- economic fortunes as well as contribute to the social reforms of Mr President,” Aboderin said. Aboderin, who is also a member of the Youth Activities Committee of the 2019 Presidential Inauguration Committee, called on youths to participate in the ongoing National Youth Entrepreneurship Empowerment Submit (NYEES). He said the NYEES initiative was designed to empower the youths to effectively contribute to national development agenda. More details about the summit according to him is available on the official website of NYEES – www.nyees.org.ng.
