US President Donald Trump has granted a full pardon to a former soldier who was convicted in the 2009 killing of an Iraqi man in American custody. First Lt Michael Behenna was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of Ali Mansur, a suspected Al Qaeda terrorist shot during questioning. Mr Behenna, who said he acted in self-defence, has served five years for unpremeditated murder in a combat zone. He was released on parole in 2014. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders announced the pardon Monday.
