A civil society organisation, the Citizens Advocacy for Social and Economic Rights (CASER) on Wednesday threatened mass action against the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for holding the certificate of Rochas Okorocha as senator-elect for Imo West. The group said INEC should quickly retraced its steps and issue Okorocha the certificate of return in the interest of Nigeria’s democracy. It said INEC did not have any ground under the law for its action, urging the commission to be law-abiding. Speaking at a press conference in Abuja, Mr Frank Tietie, who is the Executive Director of the group, said INEC’s action amounted to the subversion of democracy and the rule of law. He said an election could not be questioned based on the casual opinion of a returning officer or a national commissioner but by the relevant provisions of the law. “It is our expectation that INEC will reverse itself and save the unnecessary and endless rounds of litigations and allow the law to prevail by respecting the will and mandate of the people of Imo West senatorial district. “We therefore reiterate our resolve as a group that will do everything legal and permissible under the law, including the adoption of mass action to ensure that inec remains independent, impartial and law-abiding. “We will not allow it to be hijacked, misled and misguided by corrupt and unscrupulous persons who are determined to subvert it as an important institution of the Nigerian state, simply for personal and selfish vindictiveness.” Certificate of Return: Group threatens protest over Okorocha Imo West:  Returning Officer not under duress – Observers Certificate of return: INEC erred in law – Okorocha Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
