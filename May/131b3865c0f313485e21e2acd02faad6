The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole,  said yesterday that there was no justice in the Supreme Court ruling that awarded all the ruling party’s three senatorial seats, seven House of Representatives’ seats, 24 House of Assembly seats, and the exalted governorship position to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Oshiomhole, who fielded questions from journalists, said there was no justice when winners of elections were imposed on people based on “technicality.” He said, “ How can you ask me how I feel when the people of Zamfara voted for us in the manner they did and the courts said those votes were wasted? “Meanwhile, at the time those votes were cast, the High Court has ruled that our candidate was validly nominated. “There is something I have learned from Lord Denning, a famous British Supreme Court Justice, that the law has to be interpreted taking into account the intention of the lawmakers and try to deliver justice in its purest form. There is no justice when on technicality you imposed on people candidates they didn’t elect. “If the court thought that we were wrong, the justice would have demanded a repeat. There is nothing democratic when you impose a stranger to govern the people. But we understand that after the Supreme Court you can only go to the court of God. To that extent, we must obey the Supreme Court. But what we got in Zamfara is a judgment that didn’t translate to justice,” he said.
