The Norwegian businessman behind a “millionaire dating” site has been handed a six-month suspended sentence for promoting prostitution. A court in Belgium handed the sentence to Sigurd Vedal, the investor behind RichMeetBeautiful, which connects wealthy older men to young women. Mr Vedal was personally fined €24,000 and his company €240,000 (£207,000). The site caused a scandal in 2017 after advertising “sugar daddies” to Belgian university students.
