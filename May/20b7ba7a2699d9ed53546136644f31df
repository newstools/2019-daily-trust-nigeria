The Director General, National Metallurgical Development Centre (NMDC), Prof. Linus Asuquo, has said the centre needs about N126million to fix about 60 per cent of broken-down equipment while a quotation for reactivation of two electric arc furnaces was being awaited. The NMDC was established as a testing laboratory and research centre to conduct tests and analysis of raw materials for the country’s steel industries but now carries out other functions including upgrading the quality of Nigeria’s low grade ores and minerals through beneficiation techniques and processes among others. Prof. Asuquo stated this during a visit by the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Abubakar Bawa Bwari to inspect and commission projects at the centre in Jos yesterday. He said on assuming duty last year, a detailed assessment of faulty equipment and facilities at the centre showed that 40 per cent of the equipments were either faulty or obsolete and required replacement. While commissioning a remodeled and expanded conference hall and media centre, a microwave plasma-atomic emission spectrometer and other projects, the minister said the projects were funded through the federal government’s regular budgetary provisions and the solid minerals intervention fund for the development of the mineral and metal sectors of the Nigerian economy.
