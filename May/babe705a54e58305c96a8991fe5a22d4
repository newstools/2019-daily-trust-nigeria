An international crime gang which used malware to steal $100m from more than 40,000 victims has been dismantled. A complex police operation conducted investigations in the US, Bulgaria, Germany, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. The gang infected computers with GozNym malware, which captured online banking details to access bank accounts. The gang was put together from criminals who advertised their skills on online forums. Details of the operation were revealed at the headquarters of the European police agency Europol in The Hague. It said the investigation was unprecedented, especially in terms of cross-border co-operation. Ten members of the network have been charged in Pittsburgh, US on a range of offences, including laundering those funds using US and foreign bank accounts.
