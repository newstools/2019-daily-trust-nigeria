The US government has warned that Chinese-made drones could pose a cyber-espionage risk to American businesses and others that use them. It said those using the flying aircraft for tasks related to national security or critical infrastructure were most at risk. The warning does not refer to a specific company. But market-leader DJI said it had taken steps to keep its clients’ data secure. “We give customers full and complete control over how their data is collected, stored, and transmitted,” the firm said in a statement. “For government and critical infrastructure customers that require additional assurances, we provide drones that do not transfer data to DJI or via the internet, and our customers can enable all the precautions DHS recommends.”  ‘Why Nigeria must implement Data Domiciliation policy’ NSCDC plans to deploy more drones, CCTV against vandals Nokia still in legal battle in India Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
