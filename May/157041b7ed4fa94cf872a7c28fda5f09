With effect from close of business on Tuesday, May 14, 2019, the United States (US) Embassy in Nigeria has indefinitely suspended interview waivers for renewals, otherwise known as ‘Dropbox’ process. As a result, Visa applications will no longer be accepted by DHL in Nigeria. A statement from the public affairs section of the US Embassy in Nigeria on Tuesday said that those who have already submitted their passports via “Dropbox” to DHL for processing either at the U.S. Embassy in Abuja, or the Consulate General in Lagos, will not be affected by this change. It added that all applicants in Nigeria seeking a non-immigrant visa to the United States must apply online and will be required to appear in-person at the U.S. Embassy in Abuja or U.S. Consulate General in Lagos to submit their application for review. “Applicants must appear at the location they specified when applying for the visa renewal. “Processing of diplomatic and official (A, G, and NATO class) visa applications will continue unchanged. The US Mission in Nigeria’s processing procedures are regularly reviewed in order to assess our ability to quickly, efficiently, and securely process visa applications,” the statement reads in part. This step, according to U.S. Mission, is to provide more efficient customer service and promote legitimate travel as well as continue to facilitate applications of established travellers to the best of its ability.
