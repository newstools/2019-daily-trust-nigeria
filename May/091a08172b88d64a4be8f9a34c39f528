The Rotary Club of Abuja Metro has organised a graduation ceremony for an adult literacy programme it facilitated for 23 rural women in Sauka community of the FCT. President of the club, Princess Nneka Atuanya, at the occasion, said it was the second batch of the programme which is aimed at empowering some illiterate members of the community with basic literacy skills. She said the club had recently completed the construction of a community health centre for the community who could hitherto only access a clinic that is 7 kilometers away, and said the health centre would soon be commissioned. The Chief of Sauka, Bala Zaki, thanked the club for the project and acknowledged the impact the programme has had on the lives of adult learners and on the community as a whole. One of the women trainees, Rose Simon, expressed appreciation of the community and her entire class to Rotary and said the programme, which would remain memorable, had touched their lives positively. Certificates were then awarded the graduands and additional gift items were also given to the women, in addition to mosquito treated nets and Mama kits to assist them.
