Somalia has postponed national high school exams after discovering that papers were being sold and shared on social media. Any exams that have already been taken have been invalidated, Education Minister Abdullahi Godah Barre said during a broadcast on national TV. The cancellation has sparked student protests in the capital, Mogadishu. The exams will now take place over five days at the end of May and social media will be shut down to avoid leaks. It is unclear how the blockade would be implemented and if will be for the whole country. Mr Barre also did not say which social media platforms had been used to post the papers in the first place. The exam papers were being sold and shared on social media by a criminal network, local Radio Dalsan reported.
