The Energy Commission of Nigeria (ECN) said it is promoting energy efficiency in public buildings across the six geopolitical zones as it shared 1,000 energy-saving bulbs in Port Harcourt recently. A report of the exercise conducted at the Federal Government College, Port  Harcourt, indicated that the project involved the replacement of incandescent bulbs with 500 energy-saving bulbs in the college. The project handled by a renewable energy firm, Clean & Green Energy Ltd, is aimed at addressing the challenges of high energy prices, energy security and independence, air pollution, and global climate change. “A total of 500 LED bulbs were retrofitted in within the college premises and their staff quarters,” the commission’s report noted. It said residents of the host community were invited to a rally in the college and another 450 led bulbs were shared to the 361 parents, guardians and other residents in the host community who came to the school. 50 of the led bulbs were distributed to staff of ECN at the rally. The firm and ECN distributed other promotional materials that included fliers, posters, handbills, T-shirts and fez caps. The management of the college was grateful to ECN for enlightening the staff and students on energy efficiency and for the replacement of incandescent bulbs with LED bulbs which it said, would reduce energy consumption and their energy bills.
