President Muhammadu Buhari’s inauguration for a second term on May 29, will be a low-key affair, as a number of the events slated for the inauguration will now be held during the first observance of June 12 as the National Democracy Day, the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has announced. Lai told State House reporters that the decision to have a low-key inauguration for the President was taken at the meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) on Wednesday, 8 May 2019. He said, however, that invitations have been sent to all world leaders to attend the ceremonies marking the observance of the Democracy Day on June 12. ”Since the first observance of June 12 as Democracy Day falls into an election year, and as a measure to sustain June 12 as Democracy Day, the celebration of the inauguration and the advancement of democracy in the country will now take place on June 12,” he said. He said that the country cannot afford to have two major celebrations within a two-week interval. He said the details of the events slated for the two ceremonies will be unveiled at a world press conference slated for May 20th in Abuja Bill to make June 12 Democracy Day passes 2nd reading Buhari deserves sympathy and support – Jamiu MKO Abiola Elections and Democracy in Africa: Restoring Nigeria’s Leadership Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
