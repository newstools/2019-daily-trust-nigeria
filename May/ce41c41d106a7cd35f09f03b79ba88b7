Zamfara State needs the N10 billion approved for it in the 2019 budget because of the level of devastation that the people there have suffered from for several years due to banditry, Sen Kabiru Garba Marafa has said. Marafa, who chairs the Senate Committee on Petroleum (downstream), thanked his colleagues in both chambers of the National Assembly for the provision of the amount, tagged special intervention fund to re-building Zamfara State. The lawmaker had on April 10 sponsored a motion on the matter in which he decried the continuous banditry in Zamfara State, which he said led to difficulty in the lives of the people and displaced thousands. In a statement he signed yesterday, Marafa, who represents Zamfara Central, said the overwhelming support by his colleagues at both chambers showed that with the unity of purpose and direction, the country could overcome its challenges. He urged the Federal Government to set up an adhoc committee to be known as Presidential Initiatives on Zamfara State (PIZAMS), with a 10-year life span and pleaded with President Muhammadu Buhari to urgently set up PIZAMS as contained in the Senate resolution. He said the unfortunate and dark eight years of banditry, from 2011 to date, in Zamfara has conservatively led to the killing of over 11,000 male adults, leaving behind an estimated average of 22,000 widows and an estimated 44,000 orphans.
