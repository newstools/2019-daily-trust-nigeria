The Concerned Leaders of APC in Edo State has cautioned aggrieved members of the party not to create crisis ahead of the 2020 governorship election in the state. They said the members in question intended to cause disaffection between the National Chairman of the party, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, and Gov. Godwin Obaseki, where none exists, by spreading false rumours of a rift between them. This was contained in a communique issued at the end of a meeting held yesterday in Benin and signed by Charles Idahosa, Mackor Shaka Momodu and Usman Shagadi. Reading the communique, Idahosa also urged aggrieved members of the party, especially the APC Revival Group led by Henry Idahagbon, to learn from the bitter experiences of the party in Zamfara, Rivers and other states during the general elections. He noted that it was mischievous for anyone to hold Gov. Obaseki responsible for the poor outing of the party in the last presidential and National Assembly elections in the state. Idahosa explained that the result of the House of Assembly elections where the party won all the 24 seats showed the popularity of the governor.
