The Bamaga Tukur Foundation (BTF) has carried out a free malaria testing and drug administration outreach at the Durumi Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camp as part of activities to mark the 2019 World Malaria Day. Over 500 of the 3015 IDPs in the camp were tested, while 210 of them were diagnosed with malaria and administered drugs, Oyebisi Bamidele, the Programme Manager of BTF said. Bamidele said children and women were being targeted for now and that the men would be given priority next time. He said the aim of the outreach was to help Nigeria eliminate malaria totally, adding that the foundation was more concerned with malaria campaign, advocacy and data collection. With the theme: “Zero Malaria Starts With Me”, he said the foundation would return to supply anti-mosquito nets to the IDPs as part of the outreach. The Secretary of the camp, Bala Yusuf, commended the foundation for reaching out to them. Yusuf said malaria was one of the most common diseases among children and women in the camp, adding that, “We are happy that after testing and giving us drugs, they also taught us how to protect ourselves from malaria.” He, therefore, called on other philanthropists to not only provide them food, but also supply drugs to help address their health challenges. The foundation, in collaboration with Inamsaj Advocacy Foundation (IAF) and Roll Back Malaria (RBM), is targeting the most vulnerable groups.
