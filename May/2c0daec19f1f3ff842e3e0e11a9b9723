The Plateau State Peace Building Agency yesterday met with leaders of Fulani groups in the state to douse tension over the killings of over 300 cows in Kuru, Maiyanga and Rekwechungu communities of Jos South and Bassa Local Government Areas. The Director-General of the agency, Joseph Lengmang said at the instance of Governor Simon Bako Lalong, the agency met with leaders of the Fulani communities to de-escalate the growing tension and mitigate the risk of a reprisal. Lengmang said the meeting was rewarding given the level of assurances received from the leadership of the Fulani community not to resort to any form of reprisal attacks. “We observed with dismay a very disturbing development in Barkin Ladi, Riyom, Bassa and Jos South LGA’s where innocent people have been killed and livestock particularly, cattle were hacked to death by peace spoilers. “We condemn in the strongest possible terms these heinous acts and at the same time, commiserate with the victims and families of all those affected by the renewed madness.” At the time of filing this report, the leadership of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association in Nigeria (MACBAN) and other Fulani leaders in the state were at a security meeting with Operation Safe Haven, the Nigerian Police and religious leaders.
