The Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Hon. Mudashiru Obasa, has enjoined Nigerians, particularly Muslims, to use the Ramadan period to pray for peace and love to continue to reign in Nigeria. “The Ramadan period calls for sober reflection for all of us. It is a period that calls for us to move closer to God and we should not relent in our prayers for peace and love to reign in Nigeria,” said. Obasa gave the advice yesterday in his message to Muslims on the commencement of the Ramadan (fasting). The message was contained in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Musbau Rasak. “It is a period for us to be tolerant of each other. Ramadan goes beyond abstinence from food, drinks and sexual intercourse alone. It is also the period for us to reinvigorate and reinvest ourselves spiritually. We should continue to pray for continued peace and love in the country,” he said. The Lagos House Speaker urged Nigerians to remain security conscious by being vigilant at all times. “We have to assist security agencies in combating crimes. We should refrain from utterances and actions that can cause breach of the peace in the society. We should also endeavour to be watchful of our environment by promptly reporting any suspicious action, person or group of people to the police,” he said.
