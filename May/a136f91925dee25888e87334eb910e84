The Kaduna State Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, Comrade Ayuba Magaji has called on Governor Nasiru El-rufai to re-visit the disengagement of civil servants with a view to re-instating those who could still be productive. Speaking on the occasion of the Workers Day celebration at the Ranchers Bees stadium in Kaduna, he further appealed for the payment of benefits to workers that cannot be re-absorbed without further delay. “This appeal became very necessary as those affected are passing through severe untold hardship that have led to serious economic and social consequences with serious complications, including death,” Magaji said. He harped on the need to intervene in the lingering crisis of the New Nigeria Newspapers Limited by the Northern Governors so as to make the Company resume normal production; considering its importance to the Northern region and the Country at large.
