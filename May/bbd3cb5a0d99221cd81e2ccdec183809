The presidential aide Abike Dabiri-Erewa yesterday told Nigerians in the Diaspora to prevail on the National Assembly to approve voting for Nigerians in the Diaspora. Dabiri-Erewa, Senior Special Assistant (SSA) to the President on Foreign Affairs and the Diaspora, made the call at a Diaspora Leadership Conference, organised by the Nigerian Consulate in New York, U.S. The SSA, whose confirmation as chair of the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission is pending in the senate, said that Diaspora voting was one of the things the commission would pursue relentlessly when operational. She said that while the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had indicated its readiness for Diaspora voting, the lawmakers were uncomfortable with the idea for reasons unknown to her. Pointing out that the system was critical to the development of the nation’s politics and electoral process, the SSA pleaded with Nigerians overseas, to join forces to make it happen. “We all have to make it happen. It is going to be tough and I tell you in politics, lawmakers are not too comfortable with the idea. I don’t know why. “But we have to make it happen. If Ghana and Sierra Leone, smaller countries are doing Diaspora voting, why can’t we? “It just has to happen and I believe Diaspora voting will help our politics and voting system. “INEC has said they are ready. President Muhammadu Buhari told you when he met you that he is ready. “The only people we have to beg to make that happen is the National Assembly.”  Why Nigerians in Diaspora can't vote in general elections - Dabiri-Erewa 2019: FG pledges support for diaspora voting Dabiri tasks Buhari on Diaspora Commission Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
