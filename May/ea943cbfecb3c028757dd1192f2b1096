The Director of APC Women and Youth Presidential Campaign Team, Dr. Wole Aboderin, has commended women and youth who contributed to the party’s victory and assured them that the political structures they built to ensure such feat will be maintained. He said it was in the interest of the APC that the women and youth structures across the nation were remodelled as a key structure of the party ahead of future elections. “This structure if maintained would vigorously champion the manifesto of our party as change agents, build ideas necessary in promoting the nation’s socio- economic fortunes as well as contribute to the social reforms of Mr President,” Aboderin said. Aboderin, who is also a member of the Youth Activities Committee of the 2019 Presidential Inauguration Committee, called on youths to participate in the ongoing National Youth Entrepreneurship Empowerment Submit (NYEES). He said the NYEES initiative was designed to empower  youths to effectively contribute to national development agenda. ‘Buhari’ll get 10m votes from youths’ Buhari's campaign list: APC youth leaders protest exclusion #Elections: Aisha Buhari, women campaign team meets to re-strategise Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
