The Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) has denied the claim by the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) that one of its feeders with a history of incessant tripping caused the fire outbreak at the Apo Transmission Station on Sunday.    The Distribution Company (DisCo) described the claim as incorrect as it runs against known engineering practice. TCN lost a 45MVA transformer and several other fittings to the fire.    The spokesman of AEDC, Oyebode Fadipe in a statement said TCN only resorted to a blame game noting that it was the protection system of TCN that failed.    “It is the reason for the total failure of their protection architecture that should be investigated. The transformer that caught fire belongs to TCN. The protection apparatus for it are in the custody of and under the maintenance and ownership of TCN,” the DisCo clarified.    AEDC further said such a facility ought to have four levels of protection, from the feeder, the 33kV incomer section belonging to TCN, and the 3rd level of protection is in-built in the transformer. The fourth one is the protection on the 132kV side of the 45MVA, 132/33kV side of the transformer which TCN controls.    AEDC commended the Fire Service of the NNPC and FCT for saving AEDC customers from what would have been a calamity of immense proportion. It further recommended a complete overhaul of the protection architecture of the TCN Apo substation and elsewhere within AEDC’s franchise area.
