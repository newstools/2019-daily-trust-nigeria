Minister of the FCT, Muhammad Musa Bello, has said that Caramelo, a popular nightclub in Utako District of Abuja, was demolished in a renewed effort to ensure compliance with the city’s master plan. Bello, who was speaking to State House correspondents in Abuja yesterday, said the decision to pull down the structure was painful but necessary to restore the master plan. He said the government was not in place to destroy but that the violation of rules and regulations won’t be tolerated, adding that the business of running a city is a very serious one. The minister said the building was meant for a clinic but was converted to a nightclub. He said it was neighbours of Caramelo that drew the attention of government to what he tagged  “flagrant abuse.” Bello however assured that government under the present leadership would not stop Abuja residents from enjoying nightlife.
