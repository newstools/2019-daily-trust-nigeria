Labour’s governing body has agreed to support a further referendum on Brexit under certain circumstances. The party will demand a public vote if it cannot get changes to the government’s deal or an election. The National Executive Committee rejected campaigning for a referendum under all circumstances – as supported by deputy leader Tom Watson. The party said Labour was “the only party which represents both people who supported Leave and Remain”. The National Executive Committee (NEC) is made up of representatives including shadow cabinet members, MPs, councillors and trade unions.
