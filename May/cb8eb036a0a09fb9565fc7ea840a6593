Workers have demanded the immediate return of the N14.38 billion withdrawn from the account of the Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA) to the Nigerian Special Economic Zones Company (NSEZCO). Addressing journalists in Abuja yesterday, the Head of the FCT chapter of the Association of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria (ASCSN), Comr. Isaac Ojemhenke, said the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, who served out his first term yesterday, Dr. Okechukwu Enelamah, “illegally and fraudulently” transferred the money from NEPZA, which was the agency the money was budgeted for to carry out the capital projects in special economic zones. Comr. Ojemhenke said the action of the minister amounted to transferring the functions of NEPZA to NSEZCO and to appropriate public funds to NSEZCO, a private company. He said Dr. Enelemah was scheming to privatise Kano and Calabar Free Trade Zones to himself and also appropriate public funds to the said company in the 2019 budget. In a statement yesterday, Dr. Okechukwu denied the allegations, saying that the company was a special purpose vehicle for development of special economic zones.
