Missouri lawmakers have passed a controversial bill which would outlaw nearly all abortions at eight weeks of pregnancy in the US state. The bill was approved by Missouri’s Republican-led Senate by 24 votes to 10 on Thursday morning. Missouri’s House and Republican Governor Mike Parson must back the bill before it can become law. If approved, abortions past eight weeks would be banned in most cases, including rape or incest. Missouri’s Democratic Senator Jill Schupp condemned the bill.
