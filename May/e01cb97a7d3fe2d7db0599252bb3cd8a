The Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Abubakar Bawa Bwari, has said the roadmap for the growth and development of the Nigerian mining sector will help create more jobs and increase the ministry’s contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Bwari said this when he received a mining team from Standard Bank and Stanbic IBTC led by Mark Buncombe in the ministry yesterday. “We have the minerals in quality and quantity. We have 44 minerals across the country and the government is giving priority to the sector now,” Bwari said. He said like in cement production were Nigeria was self-sufficient, the same would be achieved in carbonate, phosphate and others. The minister said although mining in Nigeria was still at the small scale and artisanal levels, Nigeria would soon be seen as the mining destination of the world. The leader of the Standard Bank and Stanbic IBTC delegation, Mark Buncombe, said they were in the ministry to seek ways of partnering with government and finding areas of investment in the sector. He said their team would work out areas where they could invest in the sector. Similarly, the minister received a delegation from the Moroccan mining team, OCP Group Africa, Nigeria, led by the MD, Muhammed Hettit. page 24 extra FG to regulate illegal mining FG generates over 1Billion naira from mining lease Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
