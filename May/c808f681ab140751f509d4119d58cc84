Mona Mustapha Audu, son of a late former governor of Kogi State, Prince Abubakar Audu, is set to dump the Young Progressives Party (YPP) for the All Progressives Congress (APC) barely two months after declaring his intention to contest for Kogi state governorship on the platform of YPP. There were strong indications on Saturday that Mustapha would soon return to the ruling APC at an event being planned to hold in Lokoja soon. Observers of Kogi politics said that Mustapha’s recent visit to the presidency might not be unconnected with his move to return to the ruling party. Late Audu’s son ended his charity outreach programme within the week, only to be spotted in Abuja with the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha and Hon. Gidado Samani, Special Adviser to the President on Political Matters. Unconfirmed reports have it that powers at the national level are making moves to compensate the loss of his father, Prince Abubakar Audu, who died shortly while he was on his way to winning the November 21, 2015 governorship election in Kogi state. The late Audu’s son is said to have been under intense pressure from members of his family and APC elders to return to the ruling party since he declared for YPP more than a month ago.
