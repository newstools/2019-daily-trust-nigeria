Gunmen Tuesday night killed 20 persons at three villages in Kankara Local Government Area of Katsina State. The affected villages–Dan Marke Z, Dan Sabau and Karya – share borders with Zamfara State. The transition management committee chairman of the council, Anas Isa, confirmed the incident yesterday. He  said the bandits came and opened fire on the locals before rustling some of their animals. He described the attacks as regrettable “especially during this holy month.” “We held a security meeting even today (yesterday) where we resolved to meet with the state government to further intimate them on the situation. “The thing is for just to go and enter this forest and confront them face to face, is the way out. “The bandits are more in number than the security operatives on ground and moreover, the terrain of being a rocky zone with no good roads before the security reaches them, they have concluded the operation, so it’s just to confront them squarely” he said. When contacted, the spokesman of the state police command, SP Gambo Isah, said the command would investigate the incident.
