The Senate President, Bukola Saraki, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, have challenged the right of a Civil Society Organisation (CSO) to declare their seats vacant over their defection. The CSO, Legal Defence and Assistance Project (LEDAP), had filed the action in September, 2018, seeking an order to declare the seats of the lawmakers vacant in accordance with Section 68(1)(g) of the 1999 Constitution for defecting from the party that brought them to office. Those sued by LEDAP included 18 senators, 36 House of Representatives members, the Attorney General of the Federation, INEC, Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, and Deputy Speaker, Yusuf Lasun. Arguing their objections yesterday, counsel to the senators, Magaji Mahmud (SAN), submitted that the CSO lacked the locus standi to bring the action to the court because those behind it were neither legislators, members or executives of political parties. Also, counsel to the members of the lower chamber, Prof. Joash Amopitan (SAN), submitted that the CSO failed to prove that there was defection or that there was division in the political parties. Counsel to LEDAP, Jibrin Okutepa (SAN), argued that the court had jurisdiction to declare the seats of the defectors vacant based on Section 251(1) of the 1999 Constitution. Meanwhile, Justice Okon Abang has fixed May 17, 2019, for judgment. He further ordered the parties to submit copies of authorities cited in court before the close of business on May 2.
