The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has issued Certificate of Return to Mohammed Shamsuddeen Dambazau as the House of Representatives Member-elect for Sumaila/Takai Federal Constituency in Kano State on the platform of the APC. INEC had earlier issued the certificate to AbdulRahman Sulaiman Kawu Sumaila, a former aide to President Muhammadu Buhari. But Dambazau, son of the Minister of Interior, Abdulrahman Bello Dambazau, sued INEC, APC and Sumaila, challenging the recognition of Sumaila as the candidate of the party. He contended that Sumaila never participated in the House of Representatives primary election of the APC. On April 18, 2019, a Federal High Court in Kano disqualified Sumaila as the duly elected Member of the House of Representatives on the platform of the APC in the February 23, 2019, general elections. The court also ordered INEC to recognise Dambazau as the duly elected member representing Sumaila/Takai Federal Constituency. Issuing the certificate of return to Dambazau on Monday, INEC National Commissioner, Amina Zakari, said the issuance of the certificate was on the order of the court.
