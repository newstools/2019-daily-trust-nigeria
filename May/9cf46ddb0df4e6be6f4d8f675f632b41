The Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, has said there is no in-fighting among members in the state chapter of the APC. Gov. Obaseki described the rumour of in-fighting as “fake news by few individuals” who wanted the party to put them first above the interest of all. Obaseki said this yesterday during an enlarged meeting with APC leaders from Edo North held in Jattu, Etsako West Local Government Area. He said, “After a meeting with APC leaders in the three senatorial districts of the state, the feedback so far is that there is no issue. The consensus is that there are a few people trying to seek for positions they hope may be available in Abuja. In doing this, they create the impression that there are several groups in the state. “We have one solid, united party and the majority of the leaders all agree that as a government, we have done well. The people are happy with the government and the party is happy with us as well.” According to him, APC was a progressive party that put the welfare of the people first above any other interest. “Some individuals want us to put them first, which is against the party’s philosophy. In our party, we don’t share money or public funds, but use it for the benefit of the people,” he said.
