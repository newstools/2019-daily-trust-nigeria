A Grade I Area Court, Karmo, Abuja, on Thursday, ordered  that four friends who allegedly stole $600,325 Euros and N140,000 be remanded in prison. The Judge, Mr. Inuwa Maiwada, remanded Esther and Victor Yohanna, Izu Obi and Ibrahim Abubakar,  who reside in Abuja. They were charged with  joint acts of theft and mischief. Maiwada, then adjourned the case to June 3, for hearing in written bail applications. Earlier, the Prosecution Counsel, Ijeoma Ukagha, told the court that Mr. Mohammed Ahmed of NAF Base, Airport Road, Abuja, reported the matter at the Utako Police Station, Abuja, on March 28. The prosecutor alleged that the defendants and others at large, broke into Ahmed’s Toyota Corolla which was  parked in front of his house in Jabi, Abuja. She told the court that the defendants also stole three mobile phones valued at over N1m, ATM cards and other valuables. Ukagha said during police investigation it was discovered that one of the defendants, Abubakar, and others at-large transferred N2m to Esther’s GTB account. The prosecutor said the offence contravened the Sections 79, 288 and 327 of the Penal Code. Earlier, Mrs. Charity Nwosu, counsel to the defendants,  made an oral application for their bail on the most liberal terms. Ukagha opposed to the bail due to the prevalence and sensitivity of the offence.
