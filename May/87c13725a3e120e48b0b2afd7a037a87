Nigerian Union of Teachers (NUT), has condemned the recent attack on Government Girls Secondary School, Moriki in Zamfara, saying, such attacks are affecting education in the region. Secretary-General of the union, Dr Mike Ike Ene, in a statement said it is regrettable that bandits’ activities are becoming so rampant in the northeast and northwest such that people can never sleep with their two eyes closed. “What do students have to give to kidnappers, so I think is beyond human imagination that when arm robbers or gunmen struck, they found their way to schools instead of other places. It is something this country will rise up and fix squarely,” he said. Ene lamented that the activities of Boko Haram and bandits in the region is creating a wide gap in education between the north and south and has claimed so many lives of teachers thus putting everything at a threat. “In Borno State alone, we have lost over 600 teachers through this action of Boko Haram. Beyond losing them, now that Boko Haram and bandits are heading to North West you will see that it is affecting education adversely and the blow it has done to education in that area is something to cry about,” he said.
