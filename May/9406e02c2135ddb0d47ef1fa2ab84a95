The Minister of State, Industry, Trade and Investment, Hajiya Aisha Abubakar, has commissioned a Sugarcane Bio-factory in Ilorin, Kwara State, to boost sugar production in the country. Speaking during the event, the Minister said technology is critical to Nigeria’s drive to grow the nation’s sugar industry, adding that production could be fast-tracked through the use of cutting edge technologies by sugar factory owners. The factory was established by the National Sugar Development Council (NSDC) in collaboration with the University of Ilorin Sugar Research Institute. The Minister, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Mr. Sunday Edet Akpan, said the factory is expected to make good use of tissue culture to produce and multiply a few sugarcane varieties, thereby ensuring the provision of pure, clean and good quality sugarcane seeds for the growth of the entire sugar industry. The Executive Secretary of the National Sugar Development Council, (NSDC), Dr. Latif Busari said the bio-factory facility which is the outcome of a collaborative effort between the NSDC and the University of Ilorin Sugar Institute is a bold step towards addressing problems linked to the production of clean, pure and disease-free sugarcane seeds in the country.
