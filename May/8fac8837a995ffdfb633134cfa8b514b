House Democrats will vote on whether to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt for failing to submit an un-redacted copy of the Mueller report. Mr Barr had until Monday morning to release the full report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller to the House Judiciary Committee. The Department of Justice had previously called the request “premature and unnecessary”. Democrats on the committee said the vote will be held Wednesday. The attorney general also missed a deadline last week to release an uncensored version of the report. Democrats also want Mr Mueller to testify before Congress on his findings. On Sunday, US President Donald Trump said on Twitter that the special counsel should not testify before lawmakers. The US president had previously said he would not block Mr Mueller from giving evidence to Congress, and leave the final decision to Mr Barr.
