Troops loyal to Libyan militia leader General Khalifa Haftar say they have shot down a warplane and captured its pilot, whom they allege is a foreign “mercenary”. Images and videos posted on social media purportedly show the pilot in blood-splattered clothes, and with an apparent wound to the head. Gen Haftar’s Libya National Army (LNA) said the Mirage F1 was downed in Al-Hira region, some 70km south of the capital, Tripoli. In a video, the pilot said he was a 29-year-old “from Portugal”.
