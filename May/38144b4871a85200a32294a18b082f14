An Upper Area Court in Mpape, Abuja, on Thursday,  ordered that two businessmen be remanded in prison for allegedly belonging to an unlawful society. The police charged Mathew Bamiro (26) and Jacob Panshak (34) who live in Lugbe, Abuja, with extortion and belonging to an unlawful society called “Arobaga”. The Judge, Hassan Mohammed, gave the order after Bamiro and Panshak pleaded guilty to the charge and begged for leniency. Mohammed adjourned the case to May 8, 2019 for more facts and sentencing. The Prosecutor, Edwin Ochayi, had told the court that on March 17, Sgts. Collins Igwu and Oyama Paul reported the matter at the Trade More Police Division, Lugbe. Ochayi said on March 16, the defendants with other members of Arobaga (now at large) attacked their rival gang members with dangerous weapons and also stole one Infinix Phone and three Techno phones from the victims at Corban Beer Palour, Lugbe. The prosecutor said the case was transferred from the Trade More Division to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID), Abuja. He said the case was later referred to SARS for investigation and in the cause of the investigation they confessed to the crime. Ochayi said the offence contravened Sections 97, 292 and 973 of the Penal Code.
