The lawmaker representing Ojo State Constituency 2 in the Lagos State House of Assembly, Honourable Lanre Ogunyemi has called on government at all levels to increase their spending on the education sector of the nation’s economy. Hon Ogunyemi stated this while speaking on his conferment of the distinguished Alumnus award by the Adeniran Ogunsanya College of Education, Otto-Ijanikin. The conferment of the award took place during the convocation ceremony of the institution. “Education is the bedrock of any societal growth and development hence there is need for government at all time to spend money to ensure its development,” he said. Hon Ogunyemi who is also the Chairman of the House Committee on Education acknowledged the fact that government is trying its best but as it is, “we still need to do more because it is obvious that we’re still lagging far behind among the comity of nations”. The lawmaker stated further that apart from adequate funding, there is need for all stakeholders in the education to collectively work towards improving the education sector and the standard of education in the country. “There is no doubt about it: it’s a collective effort that involves government, teachers, parents and even the students are not left out. We should all come together and fashion out a workable system and strategies for the development, improvement and growth of education in the country,” he said. Hon Ogunyemi expressed appreciation to the management and the Governing Council of Adeniran Ogunsanya College of Education for making him worthy of the award.  80 new varsities, polys is crazy ASUU strike: Stop paying lip service to education, lawmaker tells FG N/Assembly to create 80 varsities, polys, COEs Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
