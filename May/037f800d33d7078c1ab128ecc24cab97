FBN Holdings has assured its shareholders of marked improvement in operating indices in 2019. The Group made this known to its shareholders during its 7th Annual General Meeting in Lagos at the weekend. Shareholders at the meeting had expressed worry over the group’s challenging Non-Performing Loan (NPL) book in the commercial Bank group from its exposure to the oil and gas sector and a number of obligors in other sectors and charges from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) as well as Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON). But the Group Managing Director, FBN Holding, Urum Eke said, “The year 2019 promises to be a much better year and we are assuring our shareholders that all the operating indices will be in safe hands and by the end of this year, the NPL should be a single digit as we will continue to pursue recovery,” Eke said. The Group demonstrated strong resilience during the period with profit before tax (PBT) of N65.3 billion from N54.5bn in 2017, representing 19.7 per cent increase despite the N15,9 per cent decline in customer loans and advances from N2 trillion in 2017 to N1.7trn recorded in 2018. Its profit after tax (PAT) grew by 31.4 per cent from N45.5bn in 2017 to N59.7bn in 2018.
