Two brothers – Emmanuel John, 21, and Paul John, 22 – were said to have died in their sleep in a shop located at Olatunji Street, Ojota, Lagos. The police said that the deceased may have died as a result of fumes from a generating set kept by the side of the shop throughout the night. Our correspondent learnt that though the Commissioner of Police, Zubairu Muazu, had ordered homicide detectives to investigate the cause of the death of the two brothers, the police believed it was an open-and-close case since there was no visible mark or wounds on the bodies of the deceased. The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, who confirmed the report, said that on May 21, 2019, at about 7.30am, one Stanley Omah of Number 46, Olatunji Street, Ojota, reported at the Ojota police station that on the same date at about 6.30am, his brothers-in-law, Emmanuel and John, were found dead in the shop. The PPRO said Omah narrated that the brothers had locked up themselves in the shop where they usually passed the night, turned on the generator and slept off. “The scene was visited by homicide detectives and the corpses were evacuated to the General Hospital, Ikeja, for autopsy. Investigation is ongoing,” he said.  ‘Lovers’ found dead in car: My brother was murdered – sister Our lives, by slain cops’  families - 935 policemen killed by Boko Haram since 1999 – HRW Ojoma Akor & Pebang Danladi Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
