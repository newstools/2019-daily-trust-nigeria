Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara has charged Nigerians to unite in the fight to bring an end to incessant violence situations across the country. He said that failure to end violence would mean that the nation would forfeit civilisation. The Speaker, who sounded the warning at the Nzem Berom, an annual cultural festival of the Berom in Plateau State on Friday, said every nation that had lost the war against violence had paid the price by losing its civilisation. “Even here in Nigeria, the North East is an example of how a nation can lose years of progress in development within a short period of unrest,” he said. “Take the situation with the Northeast where I come from, there are communities where you cannot find any representation of government. Police stations are gone, roads, buildings, hospitals and schools have all been destroyed. How long is it going to take us before we even get back to the position where we were prior to the breakout of violence?” Dogara said, to win the fight against violence, Nigerians must make a decision to be deliberate in building peace among themselves and promoting only those things that will sustain it. He urged them to resist the urge to make the same errors that have contributed in long time strife and crisis while exhibiting courage to confront opponents and enemies in order to resolve issues. Nigeria can’t attain civilisation in the midst of violence, says Dogara Speaker Dogara tasks military to protect democracy Dogara: Using legislative diplomacy for nation building Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
