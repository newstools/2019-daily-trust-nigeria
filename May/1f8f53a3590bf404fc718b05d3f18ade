The Supreme Court has affirmed the election of Suleiman Aliyu Lere as the validly elected Member for Lere Federal Constituency of Kaduna State in the February 23, 2019, National Assembly elections. The five-member panel of justices of the Supreme Court on Friday unanimously held that “there is absolutely no merit in the appeal” and dismissed it. In the lead judgment of Justice Bode Rhodes-Vivour, which was read by Justice Uwani Abba-Aji, the apex court upheld the verdict of the Court of Appeal, Kaduna, on the dispute. The apex court had on April 11, dismissed the appeal by Ahmed Munir who contested in the primary election that produced Lere as APC candidate, without reasons, which it now gave on Friday, May 11.  Aliyu Lere had won the primary of October, 2018, to represent the constituency in the House of Representatives but the party sent the name of Munir to INEC as its candidate. Not satisfied with APC’s action, Suleiman Aliyu, a former Commissioner for Water Resources in Kaduna State, challenged his party’s decision in a high court in the state. The court, however, struck out the suit for lack of jurisdiction. The ex-commissioner appealed the decision of lower court.  The appeal court upheld Suleiman Aliyu as the candidate but Munir appealed the verdict to the Supreme Court.
