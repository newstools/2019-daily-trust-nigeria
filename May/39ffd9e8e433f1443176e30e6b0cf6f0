Jos North local government Council had on Friday officially presented 15 hectares of land located at Babale Village to the Muslim Ummah of Jos city to be used as burial ground Daily Trust reports that the local government council handed over the documents of the land to Plateau state chapter of Jama’atu Nasril Islam (JNI). The council presented the documents of land through its Secretary, Hassan Maimadara. Maimadara submitted the documents of the land to the Deputy Chief Imam of Jos, Sheikh Ghazali Isma’ila Adam, at the board room of Jos Central Mosque. Daily Trust observed that the Jos Muslim Ummah lacked a burial ground in the city, having one of their self acquired land at Rusau village blocked access to it since 2008 while the old one at Zaria Road was filled up. In his remarks, Hassan Maimadara said, “As promised by the Council that it would allocate land for burial ground, Allah in His will has made it possible for us to officially present the 15 hectares of land to Jos Muslim ummah.” “The Council would employ workers that would be keeping the burial ground as planned,” he said. In his response, the Deputy Chief Imam of Jos, Shiekh Ghazali Isma’ila Adam, assured the council that the Muslim ummah would put the land into proper use. “We have gone round the land, we have seen it, Muslim ummah are generally grateful to the Council and we would put the land into proper use.” He said.
