The Lagos State Governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, yesterday commissioned the Agric Access Road, Egan, and the new Lagos State Theatre, Igando, as he prepares to vacate office on May 29, 2019. Ambode also used the occasion to flag off the construction of a link bridge connecting Egan and Ayobo communities. According to the governor, the commissioning of various infrastructural projects by his administration was in fulfilment of his promise to run a government of inclusion that would leave no resident and area of the state behind. “I am very pleased and fulfilled to see that our commitment to make our state globally competitive and radically change our infrastructural profile to one that befits a contemporary smart city has been successful with the massive construction of roads and bridges we have undertaken in the last four years,” the governor said. At the unveiling of the 500-seater capacity Igando Theatre, the governor said the development was in accordance with his administration’s promise to create a new economy around tourism, hospitality, entertainment and sports. “There is no state in the country that attracts visitors and new comers on a daily basis as Lagos does. With our population, we have a large market for every sector. After the hustle and bustle of the day, people crave for entertainment and leisure. These theatres are built to provide for this need, as well as create jobs,” the governor said.
