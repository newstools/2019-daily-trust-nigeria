A House of Representatives Member-elect, Jude Ise-Idehen, has said he won the Ikpoba-Okha Federal Constituency election in Edo State because his opponent underrated his political sagacity and ability during the election. Ise-Idehen defeated the incumbent Member, E J Agbonayima, during the February 23, 2019, elections. He said this yesterday while speaking with journalists on how he emerged victorious. “There is no miracle in politics, but it requires hard work and dedication,” he said. “It is either you are working or not working. Billboard doesn’t win election. I don’t need to publicise everything I was doing during the election. A real politician knows what he needs to do to win election. It is the people that matter and not how many posters or billboards you erect across your constituency. It doesn’t really count,” he said. He further said, “You can put a million billboards or advertisements on television, but how many people really read the billboards or watch television sets to listen to politicians? While my opponent was busy showing off, I dedicated myself to the streets,” he said. ‘We’ll reach out to Boko Haram’ PDP technically rigged Ekiti guber elections – Ewang Sai kayi, don’t bank on Ekiti Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
