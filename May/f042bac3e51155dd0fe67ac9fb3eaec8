The Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello, has declared support for the endorsement of Sen. Ahmad Lawan and Femi Gbajabiamila as the heads of the 9th Senate and House of Representatives respectively. Gov. Bello who made this known while on a courtesy visit to the National Leader of the party, Sen. Bola Ahmed Tinubu, in Lagos, said the decision of the party remained his position on the next National Assembly leadership. In a statement issued by the Director General, Media and Publicity to the governor, Kingsley Fanwo, yesterday, Bello said both men were experienced and qualified to lead the upper and lower chambers of the National Assembly. “You are our national leader and we are your children. You have set the agenda and we shall ensure we make it a reality,” Bello said. “I supported Rep. Gbajabiamila in 2015, but it was unfortunate that we lost out. This time around, we shall make sure the decision of the party prevails by electing the two of them to work with Mr. President to move the nation forward. “We have two senators-elect from my state and seven House of Representatives members-elect. They will listen to us. Even the two others who are in ADC and PDP will be lobbied to support us,” Bello assured. Gov. Bello said his loyalty to the party and the national leader of the party was not in doubt and that he would continue to build the party to remain unbeatable in Kogi State.
