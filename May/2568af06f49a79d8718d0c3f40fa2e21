President Muhammadu Buhari has arrived Abeokuta, Ogun State capital. Buhari is in the state to commission some of the projects of the outgoing Governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, christened “Legacy Projects”. His presidential chopper, NAF 540, touched down at Arcade Ground, State Secretariat, Oke-Mosan at exactly 10:18am. He was received by Governor Ibikunle Amosun, Governors Akinwunmi Ambode (Lagos); Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti) and Rotimi Akeredolu (Ondo). Others who received him are; Minister of Health, Prof Isaac Adewole; Alake of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Gbadebo and former Legal Adviser of APC, Muiz Banire. Daily Trust reports that Buhari, who skipped inspection of the guard of honour, went to exchange pleasantries with some top politicians and heads of security agencies on ground.

Some of the projects expected to be commissioned are OGTV Ultra – Modern Studio, Adire Mall at Itoku market, the Judicial Complex, along Kobape road, Amphi-Theatre in the City Centre and the renovated old Governor’s office at Oke-Ilewo.
