The Secretary of Volunteer/Support Group (VSG) of the PDP, Engr. Kingsley Onwubiko, has described the alleged plot to derail the inauguration of Imo State Governor-elect, Emeka Ihedioha, as not only unheard of, but an affront on the sensibility of Imo people. Onwubiko told newsmen that the plot was a grand design to scuttle the wish and joy of Imo people. It would be recalled that some persons allegedly being sponsored by Governor Rochas Okorocha had gone to court to stop the inauguration of Ihedioha. He chided Rochas and his cohorts for their flagrant disregard of the people’s will, saying that their plan was already dead on arrival. The trained engineer noted that no amount of disingenuous decoy of enemies of Imo would derail a constitutional process of power transition and that Imo people would not allow themselves to be subjected to another round of exploitation and oppression by Okorocha. Describing Ihedioha as the people’s choice, Onwubiko said the governor-elect was the only hope for Imo people after eight years of economic and political oppression of Okorocha. The PDP chieftain queried the rationale behind Okorocha’s prayer to court, saying he had been notorious for disobeying court orders.
