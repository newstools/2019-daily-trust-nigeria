A group in Edo State, Edo Continuity Network (ECN), has said the joint ticket of Gov. Godwin Obaseki and his Deputy, Philip Shaibu, for the 2020 governorship election on the platform of the APC is non-negotiable. In a statement signed by its Director of Publicity, Zibiri Muhammed, and made available to journalists in Benin, yesterday, ECN said the report in the media that Gov. Obaseki was under pressure to drop Shaibu as deputy was false and misleading. “It is important to state that since the inception of the Obaseki administration, there has been a very robust relationship between the governor and his deputy to the admiration of political watchers which now appears to be a great disappointment to political mischief makers and evil planners who had expected from the onset a rivalry between the duo,” ECN said. It adde that Obaseki was comfortable with his deputy and had never failed to exhibit and demonstrate that comfort, trust and dependability, hence he entrusted power to him recently as the acting governor while proceeding on annual leave. “No one is mounting or intending to mount any form of pressure on Gov. Obaseki to drop his deputy. They have a joint ticket/office that is inseparable, non-negotiable and that position remains till 2024. Obaseki/Shaibu ticket is a perfect combination with which APC can win election in Edo State,” the statement read in part. The group also debunked the rumour of a strained relationship between Shaibu and his political godfather, the National Chairman of APC, Adams Oshiomhole. It said there was no amount of campaign of calumny, calculated attempts of discord and sponsored publication targeted at breaking that bond between the duo would succeed.
