An NGO, Buhari Friends Organisation Network (BFON), has given out working tools to 40 women trained on skills acquisition at a programme in Abaji Area Council. The National Coordinator of BFON, Hajiya Farida Odangi Suleiman, presented cartons of liquid chemicals for soap making, room fresheners, tie/dye, hair dressing,  among other household items. She said the NGO collaborated with the National Directorate of Employment (NDE) to organise the three-day hands/skills training for housewives. She further said the gesture was to appreciate the women’s support for the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari. Hajiya Farida who also supported the trainees with N5,000 cash each, urged them to utilise the knowledge they had acquired to ensure they started businesses of their choices. Some of the beneficiaries who spoke with our reporter appreciated the coordinator for recognising their effort and support for President Muhammadu, and they promised to utilise the tools to start up businesses.
