A Federal High Court siting in Ibadan on Wednesday sentenced an Ibadan based Yahoo boy, Kadir Babajide-Adebimpe, to four months in prison over impersonation, deception and fraud. Justice P.I. Ajoku said that she convicted Babajide-Adebimpe based on the evidence before her and the plea bargain agreement he entered with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). “In line with the plea bargain agreement between the convict and the EFCC, Babajide-Adebimpe is sentenced to four months in prison“ “It is my belief that the sentence will serve as deterrence to others with similar intention. All the exhibits found in his possession are forfeited to the Federal Government of Nigeria,” Ajoku said. Earlier, Mr O.A. Owoduni, counsel to the EFCC, Ibadan zonal office said that the convict was facing a one-count charge bordering on impersonation. Owoduni added that Babajide-Adebimpe committed the crime on Feb. 26, in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. According to the prosecutor, the convict presented himself, using a fake name; Angel and operating a fake e-mail address to defraud unsuspecting foreigners. Owoduni further stated that items such as US $400, two smart mobile phones and many documents of the foreigners he had defrauded were confiscated from him. The prosecution said that the offence contravened Section 1 (1) (A) of Advanced Free Fraud and other related Offences Act 2006.
