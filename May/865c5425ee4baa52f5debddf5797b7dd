Waltersmith Petroman Oil Limited, operator of Ibigwe Field located in Oil Mining Lease (OML) 16, has reiterated its commitment to the safety of its staff, host communities and their environment as it hopes to achieve its target of “goal zero” incident in years. With a stringent safety regime in place to bring the risk of any accident associated with oil and gas operations down, Waltersmith in its 2019 HSE Week, with the theme: “Safety-My Responsibility,” said the week-long activity was to further emphasise the need to remind all staff/support staff and contractors to take safety as personal responsibility. The Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of Waltersmith Petroman, Abdulrazaq Isa, in a statement, said, “As a company, we are committed to full implementation of our safety policies. We will support all staff/support staff and contractors in taking time to work safely. We will address every safety concern promptly.” Isa added that, “If you stop a job for safety reasons, we will back you up. If there is an incidence, we will fully investigate and share the lessons learnt to prevent recurrence. We will recognise any staff that reports the highest number of near misses.” WEF picks Waltersmith as global growth company Page 50 Nigeria gets first modular refinery in April 2020
