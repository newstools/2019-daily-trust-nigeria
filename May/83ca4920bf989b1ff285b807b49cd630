The police in Ethiopia have arrested more than six hundred people after raiding bars in the capital Addis Ababa. The police commander Getu Aragaw said the weekend operation was an attempt to tackle rising crime. They targeted 12 bars which are popular with people who smoke shisha pipes or chew the narcotic plant, khat. Although those activities are not illegal in Ethiopia, correspondents say the bars are seen as a popular hangout for criminals.
