A United Kingdom-based group, Arise-Nigeria, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari over his reappointment of Godwin Emefiele as Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN. Governor. Arise Nigeria said President Buhari has cemented the broken conscience of our society to remain united with Emefiele’s re-appointment. According to a statement jointly signed by its President Philip Idaewor and Secretary, Charles Eze, the group averred that Buhari is no doubt consolidating on milestones on economy and security to build a giant and stronger Nigeria. The statement said Emefiele’s reappointment has no doubt silenced critics of the Buhari-led administration. The statement reads, “President Muhammadu Buhari has pleasantly surprised Nigerians and his critics, particularly the anti-Buhari campaigners with the reappointment of Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele for another term of five years. I dare say, in the history of the Nigeria’s apex bank, Emefiele has set the record as the first head of CBN to have his appointment renewed after the expiration of his statutory first tenure, since the country returned to democracy in 1999. It is an exciting achievement and a loud statement about his proficiency on the job”.
