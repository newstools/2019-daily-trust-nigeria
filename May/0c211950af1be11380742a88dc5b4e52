An NGO Faith Based Aids Awareness Initiative (FBAAI) has rendered medical assistance to 2,500 internally displaced persons at three camps in Maiduguri metropolis. The Executive Director of FBAAI, Mr. Folorunsho Oloruntunde, said the four-day medical outreach focused on HIV/Cancer test and general health  awareness. Mr. Oloruntunde lamented that lack of adequate toilets in the IDP camps and poor hygiene poses danger to the lives of displaced persons living in the camp. “The last time we visited these camps, we discovered that many inmates were not medically stable, this necessitated our interventions especially in Shuwari camp, now our medical teams have reached out not less than 2,500  across three camp that is Shuwari, Shagari low cost and CAN Centre. “We have seen issue of sanitation and welfare and there is urgent need for intervention.  We have started free HIV/AID, Cancer tests and counselling on how to prevent other diseases. “When we interacted with camp leadership, they told to us that their toilets were full and sanitation was their biggest problem,”  he said. The Chairman of Shuwari IDP camp, Philip Ayuba  said the major problem facing the camp was inadequate toilets. “One of our pressing challenge is the issues of toilets, all our toilets are full, we used to collect N100 naira from each household but now they are complaining that they are tired of paying,’’ he said.
