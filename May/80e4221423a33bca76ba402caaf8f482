In view of the precarious and pathetic condition of Orphans and Vulnerable Children,OVC, the Federal Government has been tasked to declare a day dedicated to supporting and ameliorating their suffering in the country. Chairman of ASATTAHIR International Foundation, Malam Aliyu Sidi Attahiru Sokoto made the call while entertaining questions from newsmen on the importance of helping orphans and vulnerable children in Kaduna on Friday. “These children are orphans and vulnerable not by their own wish or desires, but by some natural and preventable circumstances. Their deplorable condition therefore require sustained support, care and awareness, particularly from Government and other stakeholders in the society,” he said. Malam Aliyu further lamented that “it is quite disheartening to see OVC at the mercy of no one for care and protection. They are not only just in the agony of losing parents, but also struggling to survive in the aftermath” Attahiru Sokoto stressed that it behoves on the government especially to make concerted efforts at alleviating their plights by rallying support from public spirited individuals and other non state actors for their plights. “We all need to see them as little ones deserving love and care in order to appreciate the kindness of humanity so as to become patriotic and successful adults,” he submitted.
