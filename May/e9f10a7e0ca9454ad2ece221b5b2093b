Staff of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) marked the Workers Day celebration in Abuja with the appraisal of improved 8,100 megawatt (MW) electricity transmission capacity saying the company was no longer the weakest link in the power sector. Chairman of the Senior Staff Association of Electricity and Allied Companies (SSAEAC), TCN Chapter, Comrade Dairo Abidemi while addressing staff on Wednesday before they joined their counterparts at the Eagle Square for the celebration, enjoined them to be steadfast in their jobs and should keep the pace as one of the strong links in the power sector. Abidemi said: “TCN that used to be known as the weakest link in the electricity power ring has become one of the strongest links. Due to the effort of the present management of TCN there is no need to return back to Egypt; we should aspire to move forward.” TCN in December 2018 raised transmission wheeling capacity to 8,100MW, from 7,00MW in 2017 and 5,500MW in 2015. The union also dissociated itself from a planned industrial dispute on TCN by the Trade Union Congress (TUC) and the President General of SSAEAC, Mr Chris Okonkwo. Abidemi noted that it was illegal for Mr Okonkwo who is a General Manager at TCN to be the President General of SSAEAC because TCN Conditions of Service bars staff in the management cadre from holding positions in union associations.
