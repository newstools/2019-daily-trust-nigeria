The Sokoto State Election Petitions Tribunal will tomorrow deliver ruling on an application to dismiss a petition against the election of PDP’s Alhaji Sa’idu Bargaja who was declared winner of the February 23, 2019, election for Isa/Sabon-Birni Federal Constituency. Candidate of the APC in the election, Alhaji Sani Aminu Isa, had filed a petition challenging Bargaja’s return as winner. However, Bargaja and his party, PDP, filed an application for the dismissal of the petition. Bargaja’s counsel, Ibrahim Abdullahi, argued that the petition contravened the condition of seven days pre-hearing notice, and that it was not properly brought before the tribunal. But the petitioners/respondents’ counsel, Steve Nwoke, opposed the application. He explained they had brought the application for issuance of prehearing notice on April 6, which he said was within the stipulated time, but that it was payment that was made on April 11, because the tribunal directed that they should pay.
