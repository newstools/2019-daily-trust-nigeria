The deputy of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó has been detained by the country’s intelligence services. Edgar Zambrano, vice-president of the National Assembly, refused to leave his car when approached, and as a result he and his car were towed to prison. It is the first arrest of a senior opposition figure since attempts to spark a military rebellion against President Nicolás Maduro last week. Mr Guaidó is recognised as “interim president” by more than 50 nations. Democratic Action party leader Carlos Prosperi told reporters that he had been at a party meeting with Mr Zambrano in the capital Caracas moments before the latter was arrested by agents from Venezuela’s Bolivarian Intelligence Service (Sebin). “The vehicle was surrounded,” he said. “They wouldn’t allow us to get to him. They brought a tow truck and his vehicle was towed away.” Venezuelan online television channel VPI posted footage of the moment Mr Zambrano was towed on Twitter.
