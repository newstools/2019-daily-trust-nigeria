Pakistanâ€™s army says gunmen who attacked a luxury hotel in Balochistan province on Saturday killed four hotel employees and a soldier. The three attackers were also killed during a siege that lasted several hours. Six people were injured. A spokesman for the Zaver Pearl-Continental Hotel in the port of Gwadar said there were few guests because of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The separatist Balochistan Liberation Army said it carried out the attack. The group said that the hotel, the centrepiece of a multi-billion-dollar Chinese project, was selected in order to target Chinese and other investors. Militants in Balochistan oppose foreign investments, saying they do not benefit locals.
