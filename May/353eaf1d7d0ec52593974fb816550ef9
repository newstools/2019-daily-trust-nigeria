A former Chairman of the PDP in Lagos State, Moshood Salvador, yesterday, took a swipe on Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State over his comments on defeating godfatherism in Lagos politics. Salvador who is now a chieftain of the APC, said the comment attributed to El-Rufai was targeted at the National Leader of the party, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. Salvador who spoke during his annual Ramadan lecture advised El-Rufai to mind his business. According to him, the leadership of Tinubu in Lagos had brought positive development to the state. He said El-Rufai should face issues of governance in his state. “We don’t have problems with leaders in Lagos and El-Rufai should mind his business rather than coming here to tell us what is not. “There are serious issues in Kaduna; the issue of unpaid salaries, the issue of killings and attacks on innocent people. El-Rufai has not addressed all these and he is talking about a state that is working,” he said. He said the state would not entertain any attack on Asiwaju who he noted had done extremely well for the state. “He laid the foundation for the growth of the state’s IGR from N400m in 1999 to the billions that it is today. “There is no way we can talk about a modern Lagos without mentioning Tinubu. He is a gift to the Yoruba race, second only to Awolowo. We respect him a lot and would not condone attacks on him,” he added.
