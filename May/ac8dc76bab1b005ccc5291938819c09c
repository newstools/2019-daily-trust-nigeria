Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Yobe state council, has called on the state government to digitize all state-own media outfits for effective coverage. The state chairman of the NUJ,  Yusuf Alhaji Isa, said in a statement to mark World Press Day, yesterday in Damaturu. He noted that full digitization of the two broadcast media houses in the state: Yobe Television (YTV) and Yobe Broadcasting Corporation (YBC) would boost output of the two stations. “I urged the state government to strengthen the capacity of journalists covering the two outfits through training and re-training and provide them with digital equipment that would help them compete with their professional colleagues everywhere in the world,”  he said. The chairman also called on journalists in the state to adhere strictly to canon of fairness, objectivity, balance, accuracy and other ideals that guide their professions. “On this occasion of World Press Freedom Day, I urged you to rededicate yourselves to the role of being watchdogs of society, while being mindful of the ethics to protect yourself from the hands of law” he said. He also advised that journalists should rethink over self censorship and prepare their minds on the challenges poised by the social media as it has come to stay, “therefore you should make a move to integrate into main stream media for effective coverage”.
