A socio-political group, Dr. Hajo Sani Youth Network for Buhari Continuity, (DHSYNBC) has faulted lepers in the Alheri Special Village, Yangoji, Kwali Area Council of Abuja for saying that President Muhammadu Buhari has abandoned them after helping him to win the presidential elections in 2015 and 2019. It would be recalled that the lepers through their village head, Ali Isa, while receiving food items from Qatari Charity Organization expressed their dismay that despite helping to bring President Buhari into power in 2015 and 2019, they were yet to benefit from his government. The group in a statement jointly signed by its National Coordinator, Salisu Bala Hassan and Secretary, Nwafor Odochukwu said that even the Qatari Charity Organization which donated food items to the lepers did such in partnership with First Lady, Aisha Muhammadu Buhari. It stated: “We read their (lepers) story on Daily Trust of May 18, 2019 with shock, because the First Lady had recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between her foundation – Aisha Buhari Foundation and Qatari Charity for the purpose promoting education in the country. “And that partnership involves doing everything to ameliorate the sufferings of lepers. So for them (lepers) to say Buhari abandoned them is nothing but being ignorant of why even Qatari Charity donated food items to them.” The group added that President Buhari would do everything within his power in making the lives of Nigerians better by fighting corruption, insecurity and executing best economic policies.
