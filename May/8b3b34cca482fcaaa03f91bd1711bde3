Residents of Yashure and Dan Giza villages of Batsari local government area of Katsina state have fled to the headquarters of the council after last weekend attacks on their communities by armed bandits. Daily Trust reports that the bandits stormed no fewer than five villages on Saturday night killing one and injuring many during the attacks. The villages include: Sabon Garin Wagini,  Yar Larba, Sabon Garin Dunburawa, Yashure and Dan Giza. Sources said the bandits in large number on motorcycles were seen riding around the villages before their eventual attack. A large number of animals were equally reported rustled. “As I’m talking to you, many of the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are loitering the Batsari town with large number of them hanging around the residence of the district head,” he said. The state’s police spokesman, SP Gambo Isah, confirmed the killing of one person saying that it was the intervention of men of Operation Puff Adder that repel the attacks resulting in less casualty.
