Sector Commander, Federal Road Safety Corps, FRSC, Muhammad Kaigama Kabo has advocated for law that would regulate the activities of commercial motorcyclists, otherwise known as Okada riders, in Sokoto State. He made the call in an interview with journalists as part of activities to commemorate United Nation Global Road Safety Week and West Africa Road Safety Organization Day. He said that commercial motorcyclists were the major cause of road crashes in Sokoto metropolis. “Our investigations revealed that majority of them are from the neighbouring states and are not dully registered with the mother Association in the state,” he stated. Kabo added:”They are operating independently without any checks and some of them are involved in criminal activities like banditry and kidnappings.” According to Kabo, regulating their activities would go a long way in addressing insecurity and could boost the revenue generation of the state. He hailed Nigerian Army’s ban of okada riders in places prone to bandits ‘attacks, assuring that his men would help in enforcing the ban.
