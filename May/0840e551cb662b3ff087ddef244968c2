Mr Ibraheem AIhassan, the newly appointed Board Chairman, Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC) says the new Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge rail, when inaugurated, will be affordable. Alhassan said in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday that masses and travellers had nothing to fear concerning the charges as all classes of people would be able to afford it. “In many cases, travelling by rail is cheaper than travelling by road. So, masses have nothing to fear about the charges. “All what the masses will have to pay is fare, and the fare will be fair to everyone, both high and low class,” he said. The chairman also spoke on the Abuja-Kaduna rail operation, which he described as efficient. According to him, tickets on the route are sold out ahead of scheduled times for the service as many people have embraced it. He said that many others were often unable to get tickets due to the large number of people interested in the service. The board chairman said that the corporation hoped to increase its coaches to ensure more passengers are moved daily, without anybody being stranded or disappointed at the railway stations across the country.
