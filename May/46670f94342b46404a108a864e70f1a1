The transportation sector contributes about 60 per cent to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Nigeria, the Chief Executive Officer of Motor Vehicle Administration Academy (MVAA), Prince Segun Obayendo, has said. At a briefing to announce the maiden Transport and Logistics Excellence Awards (TLEA) holding on May 20, 2019, in Abuja, Prince Obayendo said the award would accord stakeholders in the transportation and logistics sector their pride of place as huge contributors to economic growth. “It is no secret that the transportation sector contributes about 60 per cent to the overall GDP of the country. However, either through deliberate attempt to subjugate these facts or that they are improperly articulated, many who deserve the credit hardly get it. “So, the TLEA is an opportunity to set the score right, to give honour to who it is due and also to showcase how the entire economy has been made better off with these noble contributions,” he said. He noted that TLEA created an opportunity to give back to society. “MVAA is the pioneer of Computerised Vehicle Inspection (CVI) in the country. Currently operational in over 10, we have witnessed firsthand how much people value safety and would go to great lengths to ensure that their safety is guaranteed,” Obayendo said. “As a major player in the industry, it is our corporate responsibility to ensure that as they embrace the CVI for vehicle safety on the roads, they are also exposed to other areas of safety that can be utilised to ensure a holistic balanced lifestyle,” he added.
