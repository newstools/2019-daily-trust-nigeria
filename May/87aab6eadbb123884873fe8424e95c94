The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) have streamlined the processes of listing on the NSE to achieve more efficiency and cost effectiveness. The streamlined process which will come into effect on June 1, 2019, is aimed at reducing the regulatory burden on issuers by eliminating duplication of processes between SEC and NSE, reducing the time to market for the issuance and listing of securities and ultimately driving more listing on the Exchange. With the streamlined processes, SEC and NSE will carry out joint site visits of companies intending to get listed, following the registration of their securities with SEC Mr. Isiyaku Bala Tilde, the Ag. Executive Commissioner, Operations at SEC, disclosed that, “Streamlining the issuance process with the listing process of the NSE is a major milestone for the commission in its quest to create an enabling environment capable of attracting New Listings.” The Executive Director, Regulation at NSE, Ms. Tinuade Awe, said, “As an agile exchange, we are determined to make it easier for issuers to list their securities in our market in an efficient, timely and cost effective manner.” She said NSE began its collaboration with SEC by identifying areas of duplication and overlap between the two organisations, paving way for a better experience for issuers.
