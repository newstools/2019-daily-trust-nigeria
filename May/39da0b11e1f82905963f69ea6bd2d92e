The CEO of company, Oji Chukwuemeka said the training has “a rich and well-structured curriculum which offers 30 per cent theoretical knowledge for a good understanding of the basic principles, and 70 per cent practical knowledge and work experience in carpentry training.” Oji explained that the mentoring progamme which started in 2016 seeks to change stereotype about carpentry business so that it would stop being viewed as a “menial job”. He said the programme seeks “to change the narrative, rewrite the headline, change the status quo and also to change the stereotypical approach on how carpentry business is done”. The mentorship programme is aimed at producing competent hands in the furniture industry with good job knowledge and practical skills for a successful carpentry career either in a self or paid employment.
