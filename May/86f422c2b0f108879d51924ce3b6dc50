Pensions Alliance Limited (PAL Pension) has tasked young Nigerians to improve their financial literacy and entrepreneurship skills. The Pension Fund Administrator (PFA) said the gap in financial literacy and employability skills in Nigeria must be bridged to improve standard of living in the country. The Head, Brand Management and Corporate Communications, Sunmisola Mark-Okoma said at the launch of ‘NEXTU’ in University of Abuja. She said the organization has also trained over 20, 000 young Nigerians on key skills in finance, entrepreneurship, entertainment and other skills. She said: “A lot of people work, make money but at the end of the day they don’t have anything to show for it. You need set of skills to make money and another to make the money work for you.’’ With the event, University of Abuja would join University of Lagos, University of Benin, University of Port Harcourt, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ahmadu Bello University and University of Nigeria who are already on the network.
