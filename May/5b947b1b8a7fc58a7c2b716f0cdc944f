The APC in Sokoto State and its governorship candidate, Alhaji Ahmed Aliyu, have filed an application praying the election petitions tribunal to quash the order it granted Gov. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal and the PDP to use forensic experts. It would be recalled that the tribunal had on April 25, granted Gov. Tambuwal and his party leave to invite forensic experts to conduct physical inspection of materials used in the election and obtain true certified copies of documents. But at yesterday’s sitting, Lead Counsel to Aliyu and APC, Chief Jacob Ochidi, said they had filed an application to quash some parts of the order, especially the use of forensic experts. He, however, said they were only served with the 3rd Respondent’s (INEC) counter affidavit and written address late the previous day, and that they would not be able to proceed with the hearing of the application. Ochidi explained that as petitioners/applicants, they intended to file a counter affidavit and written address on the 3rd Respondent’s counter affidavit and written address. “Constitutionally, we have three days to do so, from the date of the service of the counter affidavit of the 3rd Respondent,” he added. The counsels to the respondents had no objection, and the tribunal’s Chairman, Justice Abbas Abdullah, adjourned the case to Monday, May 13.
