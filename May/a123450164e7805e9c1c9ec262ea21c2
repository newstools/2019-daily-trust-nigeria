An APC governorship aspirant in Kogi State, Alhaji Sani Lulu Abdullahi, has promised to harness the abundant human and natural resources of the state to make it one of the most prosperous in the country. Lulu Abdullahi told APC stakeholders in the state and at the national level in the course of his consultations with them recently that he would run an “open, transparent and accountable administration” where the resources of the state will be effectively utilised for the overall benefit of the people and the development of the state. In a statement by his Media Aide, Sylvester Ojogbane, Lulu expressed regret that despite the abundant human and natural resources of the state, Kogi remained one of the most backward states in the country. Lulu, who was at a time President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), promised to apply the APC manifesto, as well as his experience in public administration for the overall development of the state if given the opportunity to govern the Confluence State. He also promised to overhaul the civil service and to give workers’ welfare the required attention and priority. Apart from promising to pay the N30,000 minimum wage recently approved for workers in the country, the APC governorship aspirant pledged to also address the lingering issues of backlog of pensions and gratuity.
