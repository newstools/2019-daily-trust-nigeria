Police operatives on Tuesday arrested Alhaji Musa Imam, the man who raised an alarm at the Kawo flyover in Kaduna that resulted in the death of three persons yesterday. Imam was trailed by three of his friends who stood as surety for him in Lagos after he jumped bail and on getting to the Kawo Bridge in Kaduna raised alarm that the men were about to kidnap him. His scream attracted a mob who lynched the driver of the vehicle conveying the three men while the two others ran to a nearby fuel station until they were rescued by policemen. In the process of trying to get the men out from the scene, security agents shot three other persons. After attracting the mob which went after the men and killed the driver, Alhaji Imam was said to have escaped. Police Public Relations Officer in Kaduna state, DSP Yakubu Sabo, in a statement said Alhaji Imam was arrested at about 5:00pm on Tuesday. The statement indicated that one of the three persons shot yesterday in the bid by the mob to lynch the three men had died, bringing to three the number of casualties as a result of the false alarm. The PPRO said the police in Lagos had called the three men who stood surety for him who trailed him to Kaduna to invite him to the station “but on seeing them, he raised the alarm that they are kidnapers and the mob attacked the men that stood surety for him.” Man lynched by Kaduna mob not a kidnapper - Police Kaduna residents lynch man, protest killing of trader Outrage over rising spate of kidnappings Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
