The national secretariat staff of the PDP, yesterday, staged a peaceful protest in Abuja where they passed a vote of no confidence on the Presidential Election Tribunal handling the petition of the party’s candidate for the February 23 election. The protesters who demanded the President of the Court of Appeal, Justice Zainab Bulkachuwa, to quit the panel handling the petition, said there was no possibility of Atiku “reclaiming his stolen mandate” with Justice Bulkachuwa as member of the panel. They carried placards and banners with different inscriptions such as “Justice Zainab Bulkachuwa, you can’t preside over your own case. Your husband is a senator-elect under APC”, “Justice is not for the most powerful, it must be seen to be right and done”, and “On moral grounds, Justice Zainab Bulkachuwa, excuse yourself from the presidential petition tribunal”, among others. Addressing newsmen at the premises of the Wadata Plaza, where they protested, the Chairman of PDP Staff Welfare Association, Mr. Clement Nwankwo, claimed that Atiku won the February 23 presidential election but was allegedly rigged out by the APC which he claimed worked closely with the INEC. The protesters also expressed worry over the worsening security situation in the country, adding that the nation’s economy under the current government was nothing to write home about.
