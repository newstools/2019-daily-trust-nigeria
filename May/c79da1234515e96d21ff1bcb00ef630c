Four persons arraigned at an Upper Area Court, Mpape, Abuja, for allegedly extorting cancer patients and engaging in human trafficking-related activities in the FCT have been remanded in prison. The suspects were remanded on the order of the court after the defence counsel failed to secure their bail. The suspects: Princess, Victor, Francis and Makinde, were arraigned on a three-count charge of criminal conspiracy, cheating and extortion of cancer patients and vulnerable people. The Police First Information Report (FIR) showed that three of the accused were apprehended on May 18, in Kubwa for allegedly assembling cancer patients and taking them round the FCT,  soliciting for funds. It added that the suspects converted the funds raised on behalf of the sick persons to their personal use. After the case was mentioned before Justice Hassan Muhammad, the accused persons pleaded not guilty. The Prosecution Counsel, Barr. Donatus Abah, made an application to the court, for them to be remanded in prison pending hearing. The Defense Councel, Pius Onigah, orally applied for bail to be granted to them, but  the judge ordered that they should be remanded in Keffi Prison and adjourned the case to May 29, for hearing.
