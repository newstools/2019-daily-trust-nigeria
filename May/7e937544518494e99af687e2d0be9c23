Kwara state government has denied removing state’s property from the Government House in Ilorin. Our reporter reports that some residents of the state had on Sunday claimed they sighted some trucks allegedly moving out some items from the state’s Government House. According to information being spread on social media by a group of concerned Kwarans, they claimed some properties belonging to the state are allegedly being moved out by the outgoing administration. They also claimed that the items in the trucks are furniture bought with the state money and other valuable items. However, in a swift reaction from Dr Muideen Akorede, the Senior Special Assistant on media to Governor Abdulfattah Ahmed, he said it is completely untrue that the Kwara state governor, Alhaji Abdulfatah  Ahmed, or any other person in the Government House, Ilorin  was moving furniture or any other government property out of the Government House. “What is being erroneously circulated are images of a truck load of charity (Zakat) items provided by Alhaji Aliko Dangote through his foundation which were being taken out for distribution to people in keeping with the annual practice. “Clearly, those were not government property. For the record, all government property inside the Government House are bar-coded and contained in an inventory which will be handed over to the incoming government,” the statement by the governor’s media aide noted.
