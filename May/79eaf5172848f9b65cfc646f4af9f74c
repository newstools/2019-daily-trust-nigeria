The Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, John Cardinal Onaiyekan has urged the Federal Government to urgently address the insecurity along Abuja-Kaduna road and others in the country, which has lead to the kidnapping and killing of several Nigerians. Onaiyekan made the call on Saturday in Abuja while briefing newsmen on the coming international conference on irregular migration scheduled for Tuesday in Abuja, with theme “Action against Irregular Migration of Nigerians.” He expressed sadness that Nigerians are at the mercy of kidnappers who now carry out their criminal activities and demand ransom without fear. “If you have no idea of how to make Nigeria develop through education, security amongst others then, do not go into politics. Unfortunately I cannot say that they should not ask for my vote because they no longer asked for votes they take it by force. Politics is for people who will organize things for us in Nigeria,” he said. On the conference, the Cardinal said migration was a fundamental right of every human being but must be done in ways that would not violate the laws of any host nations.
