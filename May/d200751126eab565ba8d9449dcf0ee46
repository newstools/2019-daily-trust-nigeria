An Igbosere chief magistrate court, Lagos, on Wednesday sentenced a 29-year-old man to one year imprisonment for allegedly assaulting a lady indecently by touching her breasts. The convict, IliasMudashiru, an illiterate, was sentenced after he pleaded guilty to a three-count criminal charge of conspiracy, unlawful assault and sexual assault. The charge, read to Mudashiru in English language, had to be translated to Yoruba language to enable him understand it. The convict committed the offence on April 21, 2019 at about 8am at Bombata Market, Oroyinyin Street, off Adeniji Adele road, Lagos Island. He admitted sexually assaulting one Judith Nwachima by touching her on her breast and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 263 (1) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015. He also unlawfully assaulted one Stanley Chinedu and ChinaAsoiba by stabbing them on the head, neck and arm with a broken bottle. In his plea for mercy, Mudashiru begged the trial magistrate, Magistrate(Ms) F. O. Sasanya, to temper justice with mercy. He attributed his acts to the “work of Satan”.
