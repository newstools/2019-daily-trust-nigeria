The Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) has called on the Federal Government to ignore the petition of the governors over the National Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) guidelines on local government funds. The President of NULGE, Comrade Khalil Ibrahim disclosed this yesterday while addressing the pressmen.  He said association in all the 774 local government councils across the country have expressed delight over the current government for taking the bold step to end the impunity in this critical segment of our governance structure. “Local government funds sent to the joint state-local government account have been subjected to the most unimaginable abuse by state governors across the federation. The governors almost without exception have since 2003 turned this account into a source of the slush fund, from which they routinely withdraw funds without any form of accountability or restraint,” he said. The Nigerian Governors Forum had written a petition to the president expressing its anger and dismay over the NFIU guidelines, accusing it of attempting to dabble into a matter beyond its mandate.
