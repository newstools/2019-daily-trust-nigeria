A former principal private secretary of the Kano Emirate Council, Alhaji Isa Sanusi Bayero, was yesterday interrogated by the state Public Complaints and Anti-Corruotion Commission as part of the ongoing investigation of the Emir of Kano, Malam Muhammad Sanusi ll. Bayero, who honoured an invitation extended to him by the commission, arrived at anti-graft headquarters of the commission at 12noon yesterday. Although the chairman of the commission, Barrister Muhuyi Magaji Rimingado, was not around, Bayero was received by a team of investigators. Bayero assured that he was ready to provide the commission with necessary information in the ongoing investigation. Confirming his visit to the commission, Bayero said: “I was questioned for 30 minutes and I left the commission at exactly 12:55pm. I was given some vouchers and asked to verify them. I identified some and requested more time to check the others at home and my request was granted. “So, I am going to verify the remaining and report back to the commission. I am hoping to go back to the commission by Monday next week to give my account on the vouchers. “I will say nothing but the truth about the vouchers in question. There is no point of telling lies to the commission and I am ready to say all I knew about the payments.” Kano anti-corruption agency renews probe of Emir Sanusi Ganduje approves 4 new emirates in Kano Late Emir Bayero’s secretary alleges assassination attempt Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
