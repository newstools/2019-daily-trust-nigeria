The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Osun has described the judgment delivered on Thursday by the Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja which upheld the election of Gov. Gboyega Oyetola as “ a shock”. The chairman of the PDP in the state, Mr Soji Adagunodo, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Osogbo that the party would be heading to the Supreme Court to challenge the judgment. “It is a shock that the judgment is like that but that is democracy at play. “ Considering the evidence we presented, we expected the judgment to be in our favour. “We are heading to the Supreme Court. The judgment is based on technicalities and we will work on that at the Supreme Court”, Adagunodo said. Meanwhile, the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun described the judgment as “a welcome development’. Mr Kunle Oyatomi, the APC’s Publicity Secretary in the state,  told  NAN  that it was a good thing that the appellate court had rewritten the wrong  done by the election  tribunal’s initial judgment. “You will remember that the Court of Appeal’s judges said while delivering the judgment that the composition of the election tribunal’s panel was faulty and that is fundamental. “It is as fundamental as jurisdiction in the common law. “We thank God that the people’s mandate has actually paid off.  We are not concerned about other things. Governance goes on. “The people of the state will enjoy the good governance of Gov.  Oyetola-led administration”, Oyatomi said.
