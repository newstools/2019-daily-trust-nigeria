The Election Petitions Tribunal in Sokoto has set aside an earlier order it granted the PDP on the use of forensic experts. The tribunal had during its April 25 sitting granted the PDP leave to conduct manual or physical inspection of electoral materials used during the March 9 governorship and March 23 supplementary polls. It also granted an order permitting PDP to rely on the outcome of such manual/physical inspection as prepared by their statisticians and or forensic experts at the hearing. But Chief Jacob Ochidi, who is lead counsel to the APC governorship candidate, Alhaji Ahmed Aliyu Sokoto, subsequently filed an application to quash some parts of the order, especially the use of forensic experts. He sought an order setting aside ex parte order relating to forensic experts, noting that it was made outside the scope of Section 151 of the Electoral Act 2010 and without jurisdiction. Delivering ruling yesterday, tribunal Chairman, Justice Abbas Bawale, set aside the order permitting PDP to rely on the outcome of such manual/physical inspection as prepared by their statisticians and or forensic experts at the hearing.
