The Chairman, PDP Governors’ Forum, Gov. Seriake Dickson, says governors elected on the platform of the party will deliver the dividends of democracy and good governance in their states. Dickson, who is also the governor of Bayelsa, gave the assurance in a statement issued by the forum secretariat on Friday in Abuja. Dickson congratulated members of the forum for their successful inauguration. He expressed confidence that PDP-controlled states in particular, and Nigeria in general, would benefit immensely from the governors’ wealth of experience as they assume office. Dickson urged the PDP governors to ensure that they fulfill their campaign promises. “We count on your good office to enhance a strong working relationship between your State and the PDP Governors’ Forum,” he said. He prayed God to continue to guide, protect and bless the governors and their families. “May God grant them reigns of wisdom, good health and the focus to excel in the selfless service to their States, the great party – PDP, and our dear country, Nigeria,” he said.
