Aggrieved residents of the Lagoon View Estate, Ibeshe, in the Ikorodu area of Lagos State, have appealed to the governor-elect, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to rescue them on an issue regarding demolished buildings in the estate through the activities of those they described as “a land-grabbing syndicate.” In a statement jointly signed by their representatives -Victor Armstrong, Adejoke Adesanya and Wilson Ukereghe – a copy of which was made available to journalists in Lagos, the residents recalled that on August 16, 2017, residents of Operiele Street in the estate became victims of a land-grabbing syndicate. “On the fateful day, about 10am, while most of us were away at work, 36 fully armed policemen, together with several thugs and some ministry officials moved in on Lagoon View Estate, Ibeshe, Ikorodu without any prior notice, with three excavators and began demolition of our buildings. “A total of 17 buildings were demolished, including one occupied by an 87-year-old woman, a 15-day-old baby and a nursing mother.” Saying affected residents lost “all their life savings” to the demolition, they said their appeals to Governor Akinwunmi Ambode to rescue them from the alleged land-grabbers proved abortive and appealed to Sanwo-Olu to address the issue when he assumes office.
