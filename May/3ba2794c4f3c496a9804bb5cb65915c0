Suspected armed bandits have killed at least 17 people in attacks on three Zamfara villages in Birnin Magaji local government area of Zamfara state, Daily Trust gathered. Residents said the armed men, riding motorbikes on Saturday, invaded Gidan Kaso and killed at least seven people there. The gunmen also refused to allow funeral prayers for the victims. “They refused to allow other residents to scoop the remains of the victims for burials until when security operatives and other local vigilantes mobilized and stormed the community,” a resident Tukur Yusuf said. Similarly, the armed bandits on Sunday raided Dan Dambo community again, killing four people and carting away domestic animals. “Seven people from neighbouring Kokeya village who arrived at Dan Dambo community to offer help were also shot dead by the armed men. “They were killed trying to offer help to those under attack at Dan Dambo community. Residents of Gidan Kaso had earlier fled the community but recently returned,” the resident said. The spokesman of the state’s police command could not be reached for comments as at the time of filing this report.
