A northern group, Allied Vanguard for Defence of Democracy, has thrown its weight behind the Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai, over his comment on godfatherism. Declaring support for El-Rufai, the group through its leader, Mohammed Sabiu Turaki, said Sen. Bola Tinubu and his boys jumped aboard a flight without actually knowing its destination. The group said the response from the Tinubu camp only got to confirm the level the South West political environment had been manipulated. “The desperate response, though grossly inadequate, is a further testimony to Tinubu’s entrenched fear of an imminent loss of control of almost a decade-old grip of the South Western political space,” he said. “Tinubu is afraid that El-Rufai’s comments could awaken the spirit of self-preservation in the younger generation of South Westerners, signalling an early demise of an era of domination by Tinubu and his ilk. “Governor El-Rufai was right to have suggested that a political space devoid of the undue dominance of godfathers is achievable in Nigeria, including the Lagos axis where Tinubu holds sway. “It is also true that Governor El-Rufai has uprooted the pillars of fascist godfatherism and flushed it out of the political system of Kaduna State,” the group stated.
