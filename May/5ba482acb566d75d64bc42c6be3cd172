The National Working Committee (NWC) of the ruling APC has congratulated the Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, on his election as the new Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF). The APC National Publicity Secretary, Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, said in a statement yesterday that the NGF’s unanimous election of Fayemi to lead the forum till 2021 was a right choice judging by his proven record of progressive leadership and experience as a development expert, minister, governor, among other endeavours. Issa-Onilu said the non-partisan NGF had been a strategic partner in deepening democracy and entrenching good governance in the country since its establishment. He expressed the party’s confidence that the NGF under Fayemi’s leadership would continue in this best practice by cooperating and supporting the President Muhammadu Buhari-led APC administration in delivering on the “Change Agenda” for Nigerians, particularly as the country geared up for the next four years of the administration’s renewed mandate.
