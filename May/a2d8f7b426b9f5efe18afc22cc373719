A former PDP Deputy National Chairman, Chief Olabode George, has reflected on the 20 years of Nigeria’s democracy, concluding that the nation is not at ease. Chief George also described as deceitful the celebration of June 12 as Democracy Day, saying while it was important to celebrate the heroes of June 12, the country had not learned from mistakes. Addressing a press conference in Lagos yesterday, George said his intervention was not driven by political or ethnic affinity, but as a concerned Nigerian elder and patriot. He said restructuring which would engender true federalism where power would devolve to the federating units, was the only solution to Nigeria’s problems. While Nigeria should be in the mood of celebration, the PDP leader regretted that the nation was “embattled.” He said the June 12 celebration declared by the Federal Government would not put food on the table of Nigerians, saying, “What is in a date? What impact will this have?” George also condemned the attacks on former President Olusegun Obasanjo over his comment on the herdsmen and banditry crises, saying it was wrong to tag the ex-president as a religious bigot.
