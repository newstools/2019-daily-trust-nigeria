Three players shared the Golden Boot award after Arsenal’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang equalled Liverpool duo Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane as the top scorers in the 2018/19 Premier League, on 22 goals each. It is the first time three players have shared the award since Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Michael Owen and Dwight Yorke in 1998/99. Salah led the race going into the final day, but he could not add to his 22 goals. Mane struck twice in the second-placed Reds’ 2-0 home win over Wolverhampton Wanderers to tie with his Liverpool team-mate.  Arsenal’s Aubameyang also netted twice, in a 3-1 win at Burnley, and he was the man who threatened to take the award on his own as he missed a late chance to claim a hat-trick. Mane and Aubameyang have won the award for the first time, while Salah has claimed the Golden Boot in back-to-back seasons, after scoring 32 times in 2017/18.
