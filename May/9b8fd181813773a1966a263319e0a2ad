The governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Osun State, Senator Adelola Adeleke has filed four appeals at the Supreme Court against the decision of the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal in Abuja had, on May 9, voided the decision of the Osun State Election Petitions Tribunal which declared Adeleke winner of the state governorship election held on September 22 and 27, 2018. The appeals were filed by his lead counsel, Dr Onyeachi Ikpeazu (SAN) against the majority judgement in favour of Governor Gboyega Oyetola, All Progressives Congress (APC), the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the striking out of the cross appeals of Senator Adeleke. The appeals are seeking an order of the apex court to set aside the decision of the Court of Appeal and dismiss the appeal brought by Gov. Oyetola. Adeleke also contended that the Court of Appeal erred in law when it upheld the appeals by APC and INEC challenging the decision of the tribunal. He also contended that the appellate court erred when it dismissed its cross appeal, where it challenged the improper ballot counting which cost it 3, 402 and 379 votes in 23 polling units. Adeleke and PDP are therefore, seeking a declaration that they won the election by a wider margin than what was found by the lower tribunal. He is seeking for “a declaration that the rerun of 27th was null and void and of no effect as the appelants had already won the election in issue upon conclusion of the 22nd September election.” Osun guber: Scores of judgement as Adeleke, Oyetola lock horns in courts Osun Guber Poll: Oyetola floors Adeleke at Appeal Court Osun gov’ship: We were denied 3,781 votes — PDP Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
