The Director General/CEO, Energy Commission of Nigeria (ECN), Prof. Eli Jidere Bala, has charged Lagos residents to ensure energy efficiency in the public buildings. He made the appeal Tuesday in Lagos at a seminar on “Promotion of Energy Efficiency in Public Building in six Geo-Political zones: Case Study of the Federal Government Colleges in Nigeria and their Host Communities”. According to him, energy is more than electric power as it is the driving force of the modern living with everyone using it in one way or the other, including in transportation, manufacturing and entertainment among others. “Sustaining this quality of life requires that we use available energy resources wisely. Careful management of resources means reducing total energy use for achieving the same or even better results. “The choice we make about how we use energy, turning off machines when not in use or choosing to buy energy efficient appliances would not only save energy cost and improve our living standard but significantly contribute to the quality of the environment,” Bala said. He said, “Many years back the commission started enhancing the capacities of secondary school students thought various awareness creation activities in the field of energy in the FCT, now there is the need to expand the programme to other regions of the country to ensure wider adoption of energy efficiency measures by our teeming youths especially in the secondary schools.” Also, the programme facilitator, Comrade Ikechukwu Norbert urged Nigerians to concerned about energy management in the interest of the country.
