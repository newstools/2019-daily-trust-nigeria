The Department of Petroleum Resources (DRP) has said Anambra, Enugu and Kogi states cannot be recognised as oil-producing states because an oil company was still test-running the discovery in the areas. DPR said in a letter to the Senate Committee on Petroleum (Upstream), chaired by Taiwo Alasoadura (APC, Ondo), that Orient Petroleum, which was given the licence to explore crude oil in the Oil Prospecting Licences (OPLs) 915 and 916, was yet to meet certain requirements. First, it said, the company could not convert the OPL to Oil Mining Licence (OML), which is a key requirement in recognising a place as an oil-producing area. After the conversation, the company is expected to relinquish 50 per cent of its activities, but that all of those had not been done. “Therefore, Anambra, Kogi and Enugu cannot be categorised as oil-producing states for no‎w” the letter, read by Alasoadura during a meeting with officials of the National Boundary Commission (NBC), indicated. But members of the committee expressed concern that after DPR granted licence to Orient Petroleum since 2012, it was yet to begin exploration properly. A Senator from Enugu State, Chukwuka Utazi, whose senatorial district is affected, said he believed the DPR failed in its responsibility by not compelling the oil company to do the proper thing seven years down the line. Consequently, the committee resolved to write to DPR to demand explanation from it on why it failed to take action against the company.
