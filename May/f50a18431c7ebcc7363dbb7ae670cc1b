As Ondo State is set to inaugurate its 9th House of Assembly on Monday, July 3, the 8th House organised a two-day capacity workshop for the 26 newly elected members. The workshop, aimed at broadening the minds of the elected lawmakers, took place in Lagos. They were prepared on legislative agenda, the procedures, how to cater for the primary needs of their people, among others. Declaring the event open at Epe Tourists Resort, Lagos, Ondo State Governor, Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, congratulated the lawmakers-elect. He said the decision of their people to elect them was a testimony that they had confidence in them, urging them to be ready to serve. One of the lawmakers-elect, Chief Success Taiwo Torhukerhijo (Ese-Odo Constituency), said the training was good and useful. Torhukerhijo, a lawyer and journalist, said he would pursue a Categorical Minority Policy (CMP) which was intended to champion the cause of the minority Ijaw: Arogbo and Apoi, at the House. He also said the workshop would position his people for better entrenchment, consideration in the polity and commonwealth of Ondo State and Nigeria.
