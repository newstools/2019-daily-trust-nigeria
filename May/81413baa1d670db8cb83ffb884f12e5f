Governor Umaru Al-Makura of Nasarawa State has disengaged all his political appointees ahead of his exit from office on May 29. Al-Makura announced the disengagement of the appointees during an expanded state executive council meeting on Wednesday in Lafia. He said the decision was to ensure a seamless transition from his administration to the incoming administration of Mr Abdullahi Sule. Al-Makura, however, said that some appointees handling critical positions that have to do with the day-to-day running of government would maintain their positions until May 29. He also directed all Commissioners to tidy up their hand over notes and submit same to him on or before May 20. The governor said the handing over notes would be a guiding document to their successor. He explained that even after submitting the hand over notes, all the commissioners would remain on their desks until May 29. “We came together and we shall leave together. “We would all work relentlessly towards a seamless and exciting transition to the new administration,” Al-Makura added.
