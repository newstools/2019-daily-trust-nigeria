The South West chapter of the PDP, yesterday, faulted the Court of Appeal decision affirming the election of Gov. Adegboyega Oyetola and nullifying the verdict of the Osun Governorship Election Petition Tribunal which earlier declared Sen. Ademola Adeleke as winner of the governorship election. Chairman of the party in the state, Dr. Eddy Olafeso, said the party was shocked at the premise upon which the said verdict was “anchored”. Dr. Olafeso hinted that the decision would be appealed at the Supreme Court, expressing optimism that justice would be served in favour of the PDP candidate. He said, “It is crucial for us to underscore our fervent belief that justice is the bedrock upon which our democracy rests squarely, and without it, despotism shall reign unhindered. That will not be the portion of our dear nation, thus we are determined to ensure that we pursue all actions that will give muscle to the electoral desires of the people of Osun State as validly expressed in that election.”  South-West PDP ‘shocked’ by Appeal Court verdict on Osun Osun guber: Scores of judgement as Adeleke, Oyetola lock horns in courts Election results: Why Atiku must go to court — South West PDP Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
