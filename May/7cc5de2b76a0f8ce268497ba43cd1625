The Ugondo Community in Donga local government area of Taraba state have commended the federal government for the deployment of Army personnel to intervene in the crisis between Tiv and Jukun in the state. Chief Ugondo Uma-Gbuo, leader of Tor-Damisa community gave the commendation while speaking to newsmen in Jalingo on Tuesday. He said the arrival of the troops show the level of concern by the federal government to bring an end to the lingering crisis between the two ethnic groups.
