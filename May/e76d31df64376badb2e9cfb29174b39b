A court in Montenegro has handed five-year jail terms to two pro-Russian opposition politicians for trying to topple the government in October 2016. The court also found 12 others guilty, including two Russians – alleged GRU secret agents – tried in absentia. Prosecutors said the plotters had Kremlin support to assassinate then-Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic and block Nato accession. Russia has called the coup inquiry absurd. Montenegro’s opposition has consistently rejected the charges, alleging what it called a “false-flag” operation – a fake act aimed at incriminating an opponent – to keep Mr Djukanovic in power. He is now the president. The opposition leaders jailed on Thursday are Andrija Mandic and Milan Knezevic – MPs in the Democratic Front Alliance.
