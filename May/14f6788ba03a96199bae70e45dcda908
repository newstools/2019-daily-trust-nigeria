The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, has demanded N500 million from President Muhammadu Buhari’s aide, Lauretta Onochie, for alleged “defamation of character.” In a letter dated May 14 and addressed to Onochie by Atiku’s Lawyer, Mike Ozekhome, the former vice president threatened to commence a N2 billion suit against her if she did pay N500m damages. According to the letter, Onochie had alleged that Atiku was on a watch list of the security operatives in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). She also allegedly accused the former vice president of shopping for terrorists in the Middle East. Atiku’s Lawyer said the allegations portrayed Atiku as an evil man, mentor of terrorists, someone who has link with terrorists and a person who was interested in destabilising the peace and unity of Nigeria. “It has caused him (Atiku) national and international backlash and embarrassment and done incalculable damage to him,” Ozekhome said. “If you refuse and or neglect to accede to our above modest demands within 48 hours from the date of this letter, we shall be compelled to activate the full weight of the legal machinery against you without any further recourse to you. “We shall in such a suite, be claiming against you the sum of N2 billion representing exemplary aggravated and punitive damages. This shall be in addition to our demands in the paragraphs above,” the statement added.
