The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday, said the apex bank will sustain its use of unconventional monetary policy to boost economic growth and enhance price stability. Emefiele disclosed this at the first University of Ibadan Distinguished Leadership Lecture Series. He argued that the unorthodox policies were well conceived and had been yielding results. “If by our intervention, we are able to create two million jobs and the fiscal authorities create three million jobs by their intervention, the economy will benefit from it,” he said. Emefiele noted that there had been global shift towards unconventional policy tools since the global financial crisis of 2008 which exposed the weakness of conventional monetary tools in tacking macroeconomic challenges. He said these developments prompted the CBN and the Federal Government to also adopt a combination of unconventional monetary and fiscal policy measures which helped to lift the country out of recession in 2017. Emefiele said, “The favourable outcomes and strengthening outlook of the Nigerian economy is traceable to the timeous adoption on non-traditional policy methods. The CBN has been able to reduce inflation, build our Foreign Exchange (FOREX) reserves, maintain FX market stability, and foster real growth.” CBN gov Emefiele warns...
