The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has called on the Gombe State government to decongest the southern bypass curb frequent accidents along the road. The Controller of the Gombe Field Office of the DPR, Abdullahi Abawa, made the call in Gombe while briefing newsmen on the situation report on two fuel tanker accidents that claimed about 20 lives within a week. He said 18 people were killed while 10 others were injuredÂ  on Saturday April 13 when a truck carrying petroleum product exploded at the outskirt of Gombe. Abawa added that on April 17, two persons were killed and four others injured when another fuel tanker, carrying diesel, felled down near a bridge along the Gombe southern bypass. He said, however, that since the incident took place two weeks ago, no government agency or corporate body had assisted the victims and other survivors of the incidents. The controller, therefore, called on the state and national emergency agencies to compensate the victims. According to him, government agencies and corporate bodies should assist the victims by settling their medical bills and providing them with capital to enable them return to their businesses. The DPR controller further appealed to the state government to provide the state Fire Service with modern firefighting equipment, to enable them to respond to emergencies promptly. He also advised the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) to acquire firefighting trucks and equipment to be able to respond in the event of fire outbreak in the course of distributing petroleum product across the country.
