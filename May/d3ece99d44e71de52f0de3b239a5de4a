At least five Sudanese protesters and a member of the security forces have died in clashes in the capital, Khartoum. They were killed in gunfire at a sit-in outside military HQ where demonstrators are demanding full civilian government. Dozens have also been injured. Protesters said soldiers were responsible, but the army blamed it on “unidentified elements”. Sudan has been ruled by a transitional military council since last month’s toppling of President Omar al-Bashir. It is unclear exactly what happened but activists have been talking about how they were targeted by a gunman. “He shot a bullet at me, he was 20 metres away from me, at most,” Raed Mubarak told Reuters.
