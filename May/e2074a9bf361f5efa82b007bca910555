The Chief Executive Officer of Marathon Restaurant group, Africa, Tony Ozanne has urged foreign investors to engage and partner with locals in order to succeed in their business. Not having local engagements he insisted, will make it extremely difficult as they are the ones who will guide the investor on the bureaucracy and logistics needed for the business to succeed. Ozanne made this known on Friday during a partnership between Pizza Hut, the world’s largest pizza chain with over 17,000 restaurants in over 17 countries, and Jumia Food. The Pizza man expressed his optimism that the partnership between the 60 year old United States pizza company and the Nigerian delivery platform will further help grow the business. “People using the Jumia App can access the pizza hut Nigeria menu across our locations in Nigeria through our outlets in Lekki, Ikoyi and Ikeja. We started operations in Nigeria in December 2018. When we had similar partnership in South Africa, we had 30 to 40 per cent increase in our delivery.” Ozanne revealed plans of expansion beyond Lagos in 2020 to Abuja and other cities, while insisting more locations will be opened in Lagos for business later this year.
