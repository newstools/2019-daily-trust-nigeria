The founder and president, Nana Halima Empowerment Initiative, Halima Suleiman-Zakari, has advised youth against the use of hard drugs, which is said to be a common practice in the northern Nigeria. Speaking on Monday during a press conference in Abuja, Hajia Halima stated that Northern youths need to be diligent and shun all forms of evil vices that may endanger their well-being. She said the abuse of drug was an epidemic in the Northern Nigeria today hence “most people do not want to talk about it and so it is been swept under the carpet. But unfortunately if your brother is not into it your sister is doing it or someone you know in the family. ” “We are creating awareness, although so many people have been rescued from drug abuses but as you may know after the rescue mission we still have cases of relapse, we are not tired. For us it is a continuous process. We have our five years plan already and we are looking at helping more people by building rehabilitation centers everywhere in Nigeria by God’s grace. “I have single-handedly funded the project because I am driven by passion to help humanity. My advice to young Nigerians is that, they should stay away from drugs and evil vices because it’s only going to destroy them, there is nobody that is addicted to drugs with success story. We need to help them stay away from drugs and related vices”. Nana Halima Empowerment Initiative is currently campaigning against the use of drugs among the youths, enlightening them on the dangers of drug abuse with the theme “Drug free Northern Nigeria Project”.
