The crisis rocking the Imo State House of Assembly deepened on Friday with the suspension of former Speaker, Acho Ihim and former Majority Leader, Lugard Osuji for 11 legislative days. The assembly is set to wind up on June 6. The resolution to suspend the two former principal officers was taken at a plenary presided by the new speaker, Chinedu Offor. Offor emerged the new speaker on Thursday after Ihim’s successor, Lawman Duruji, resigned less than 48 hours after he was elected by his colleagues. The speaker, who confirmed the development to our correspondent in a telephone interview, said the duo were suspended for dereliction of duty. He said,  “Yes the two former leaders were suspended because they did not run the house well.  They were not diligent in the administration of the house.” Efforts to speak with the two former officers were not successful as their mobile lines were not reachable. 3 principal officers of Imo Assembly resign BREAKING: Ekiti lawmakers impeach speaker, deputy, suspend 12 others Imo speaker, Ihim resigns Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
