The operatives of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking In Persons (NAPTIP) have arrested 55-year-old Salisu Sabiu and 51 year old Ibrahim Mansur Yola, both staff of the Federal Ministry of Youths and Sports, Abuja, for sexually defiling a 13 year old girl.   The suspects, who lived in the same neighbourhood with the victim in Dutse, a suburb in the Federal Capital Territory, were arrested following a tip-off by a well-meaning Nigerian who learnt of the dastardly act being committed by the men against the teenager.   Following their confession and admittance of committing the offence, the suspects will be charged to court and prosecuted under the Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act, 2015.   While reacting to the arrest, the DG NAPTIP, Dame Julie Okah-Donli condemned the abominable act and lauded the effort of the well-meaning Nigerian who reported the case to NAPTIP, added that the Agency will ensure that justice is served through diligent prosecution and sending them to jail.   She used the opportunity to draw the attention of the public to the whistle-blowing policy of the Agency, which she encouraged members of the public to make use of in reporting suspected cases of human trafficking and exploitation while assuring whistle-blowers of their complete anonymity and protection by the Agency.
