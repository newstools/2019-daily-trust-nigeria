The election petition tribunal, holding in Katsina, said it is set to deliver judgment within the constitutionally stipulated 180 days. Speaking at its inaugural sitting, the chairman of the tribunal Justice Hadiza Ali Jos said the strategy of delaying proceedings will not work as the tribunal was mandated to deliver judgment on each petition within 180 days from the date of filling. “This means that everyday counts and we have made up our mind no petition will lapse with the panel,” she said. According to her, counsels as stakeholders should ensure justice is done rather than winning case at all cost, adding that “we cannot afford to sideline justice for our personal interest.” It would be recalled that the tribunal had received one petition each for the March, 9 Governorship and for the state house of Assembly election. The petitions are those of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) challenging the election of governor Aminu Masari of the All Progressive Congress APC. The other was also that of the PDP and its candidate Aminu Abashe, challenging the election of Ghali Garba of APC as the law maker representing the Kusada constituency at the state assembly.
