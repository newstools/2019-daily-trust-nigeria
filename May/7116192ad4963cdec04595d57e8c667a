The Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN), has announced the untimely and painful death of its President Comrade Francis Olabode Johnson, in the early hours of Friday at the National Hospital Abuja, after a brief illness. Late Comrade F.O. Johnson until his passing on was a staff of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and was on his final lap of his eventful and transformational six years tenure as President PENGASSAN, having been elected to that position in June 2014 and re-elected in 2017. In a joint statement by PENGASSAN Deputy President Comrade Frank Esanubi and General Secretary, Comrade Lumumba Okugbawa, the union said the late Johnson will be remembered by his comrades, co-workers, family and friends for being thoughtful, humorous, compassionate and transparent as he touched the lives of so many and was the very embodiment of strength, patience, and perseverance. “These attributes propelled him to develop a deep connection with nature, zest for life and the total transformation of PENGASSAN National Secretariat and initiating the e-library and Events Resources Centres in all of our Zonal offices.” His joyous laughter and giving spirit will forever be ingrained in our memories. Burial rites will be communicated to the general public as soon as we receive information from the family,” the statement said.
