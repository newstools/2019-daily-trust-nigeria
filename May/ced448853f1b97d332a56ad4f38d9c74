The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has denied knowledge of its governors’ induction and investment retreat purportedly slated for May 16-22, 2019, in Dubai. There is a poster circulating in the social media containing the portraits of all the serving governors and governors-elect on the platform of the PDP indicating that the retreat would have the theme; “Getting Ready for the Task.” It also indicated that the retreat would be held in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and precisely at The Retreat Palm, Dubai MGallery by Sofitel East Crescent, the Palm Jumeirah-Dubai. It is also adorned with PDP colours of red, white and green as well as the party’s logo. But when contacted on phone, the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan told our correspondent that he was not aware of the governors’ planned meeting in Dubai. Ologbondiyan who earlier didn’t respond to a phone call put to him by our reporter, later in a text message said, “I’m not aware.” Similarly, the Chief Press Secretaries (CPS) to two PDP governors who pleaded anonymity denied knowledge of the retreat in the UAE. It could be recalled that the PDP leaders led by the party’s National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus as well as the PDP presidential candidate for the February 23, 2019 election, Atiku Abubakar held a strategy meeting in Dubai, prior to the 2019 general elections.
