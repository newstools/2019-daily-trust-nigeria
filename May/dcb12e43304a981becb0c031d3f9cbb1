The Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), FCT Council, on Tuesday, congratulated its members on the 2019 Workers’ Day, urging them to always uphold the ethics of the profession . In a statement signed by the  Secretary of the council, Ochiaka Ugwu, in Abuja, the council’s Chairman, Com. Emmnauel Ogbeche, urged members to always maintain the tenet of objectivity. Com. Ogbeche informed his colleagues that the FCT NUJ would not be observing the 2019 Workers’ Day celebration due to paucity of funds. “As we wish our colleagues all the best as this day is marked, our council reiterates the need for journalists’ employment and social rights to be respected and improved on, especially at this time of economic downturn,” he said. He pledged the council’s total commitment to improving the working conditions and social protection for journalists. He added that, “It is also important that government at all levels does not allow employers to use the economic crisis as an excuse to dismiss vulnerable employees or cut back on crucial benefits. “We believe that the labour legislation must be strengthened as it has too many loopholes, which too often leads to personal interests being put before workers’ rights. “Another crucial issue for us is the continuing non-payment of salaries by private media owners; which the national body is working hard to correct,” he said. Ogbeche, however, revealed the plan of the council to celebrate the Press Freedom Day slated for May 2, which would be in partnership with UNESCO, urging his colleagues to observe it as important issues affecting journalism would be discussed.
