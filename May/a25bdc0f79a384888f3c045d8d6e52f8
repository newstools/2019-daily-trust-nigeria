Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano state has said that the Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II is supposed to report to a local government chairman and not him. Ganduje who was reacting to the uproar trailing the creation of four new emirates from the Kano emirate council, said the splitting of the council was not a vendetta against Sanusi. “ So it is not vendetta, I am not against him, in fact he is supposed to be reporting to the local government chairman according to the constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria.” “ It is the local government chairman that is suppose to discuss issues with him not the governor. So this is celebrated by the people of Kano and we will make sure that the new Emirate council are effective in terms of developing Kano State,” he told State House reporters.
