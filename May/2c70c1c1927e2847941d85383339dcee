The President of the Yoruba Council of Youths Worldwide (YCYW), Aremo Barr. Oladotun Hassan, has said that rotation of the presidential seat from the North to the South in 2023 is not negotiable. In statement issued after speaking at the end of the maiden of World Omoluabi Day programme held in Ile-Ife, Osun State, on May 1, the youth leader said the statement credited to some “self-appointed” youth leaders and elders from northern Nigeria, claiming “retainership” of power beyond 2023, that the North could still produce the president, was not only selfish, treacherous and deceitful, but was capable of causing bad blood. He, however, said he believed that those who released the recent statement lacked the sovereign capacity and support of the good people and core leaders from the North. He said it was only a figment of their own imagination that did not represent the mind of the northern majority and Nigerians at large. He added that the political alignment that produced President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015 and 2019 would remain intact and alive in 2023. 2023: Power shift to South non-negotiable - APC chieftain VON DG to Ohaneze: Organise, don't agonise over 2023 Igbo presidency 2023 Presidency: Igbo youths demand categorical statement from Buhari
