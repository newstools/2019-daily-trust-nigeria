A Federal High Court in Abuja has approved the application of Senator Ademola Adeleke, who is facing allegations of examination malpractice, for leave to travel abroad for medical treatment. Justice Inyang Ekwo yesterday ordered the registrar of the court to release Adelekeâ€™s international passport to enable him travel to the United States between May 7 and June 9. The judge ordered the lawmaker to return the travel document to the court registrar within three days of his return to the country. Sen. Adeleke, who is also governor-elect of Osun State under the platform of the PDP and others are facing a seven-count charge of personating and registering as internal students of Ojo-Aro Community Grammar School, Ojo-Aro Osun State, to enable him sit for the National Examinations Council (NECO) examination of June/July 2017.
