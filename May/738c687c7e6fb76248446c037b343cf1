Women groups and experts on gender have called on the Federal Government to ensure 35 per cent appointment for women in the new administration. They made the call during an interactive session they had with the wife of the President, Hajiya Aisha Muhammadu Buhari, and other stakeholders at the State House in Abuja recently. Women’s inclusion in politics and decision making will go a long way in ensuring development in the country, they stated. The women, in particular affirmed that a former Minister of State for Science and Technology and former Deputy Governor of Plateau State, Dame Paullen Tallen, was qualified to be appointed Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) in line with the zoning arrangement of the APC. A former Minister of Women Affairs, Mrs. Josephine Anenih, said Tallen and many other women had contributed immensely to the development of the country for many years. She urged women to support and vote for fellow women who were aspiring for elective positions, as well as all-inclusiveness in government. She said Rep. Nkeiruka Onyeojeocha should also be supported as the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and made a case for the two female governorship candidates in Kogi and Bayelsa states at the next polls in November, 2019.
