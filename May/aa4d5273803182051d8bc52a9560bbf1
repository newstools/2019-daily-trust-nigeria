The Awujale and Paramount ruler of Ijebuland, Oba Sikiru Kayode Adetona has accused the Governor of Ogun State, Ibikunle Amosun of disliking the Ijebu people. The Awujale spoke in Ijebu-Ode, Ogun State at the 3rd Oba (Dr) Sikiru Kayode Adetona’s annual Professorial Chair in Governance Lecture. He accused Amosun of working against the interest of Ijebuland at the just concluded 2019 elections. The first class monarch said though “Amosun is my friend and he likes me”, the outgoing governor worked against emergence of a successor from Ijebu extraction. “Amosun does not like the Ijebus, but he is my friend, he loves me and he is close to me. How would you claim to love me, but hate the Ijebus? If you are talking of Ijebuland, I am the real Ijebu. “I must thank Governor Amosun because he stood by me but that isn’t enough, for you to have thrown stones at an Ijebu person, you have thrown stones at me,” the monarch said.
