The gubernatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in Plateau State, Jeremiah T. Useni, has expressed confidence that his petition before the election petition tribunal is insulated from the current leadership tussle in the party. The PDP chairman in the state, Damishi Sango and his deputy, Amos Gombi Goyol, were last suspended last week over alleged diversion of presidential campaign funds. They were also accused of diverting N9.8 million meant for Internally Displaced Persons (IPDs). But Useni while speaking with the local government chairmen of the party said attention and unity to face the issues at the tribunal which offered them opportunity to recover their alleged mandate were intact. “We have a good case at the tribunal,” the senator said. “People should feel free to express their grievances, but they should do so through the right channels and in consultation with one another,” he said. Meanwhile, the PDP legal team had assured that petitions relations to the governorship and state house of assembly elections were safe from ongoing rumbling within the party. A statement by the senior counsel on the issues, Barrister Sunny-Gabriel Odey, said the cases were firmly before the tribunals and therefore shielded from partisanship and divisions. “All the PDP petitions at the two election tribunals are founded on solid grounds as required by the Electoral Act and the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,” he said. “We remain focused and committed to professionalism so as to achieve result-oriented outcomes for the benefit of all-party men, women and the youths. “Our assurances of neutrality and commitment to serve and propel our great party to victory are genuinely founded on patriotic zeal,” he added.
