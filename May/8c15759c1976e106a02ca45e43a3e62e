Supporters and members of the APC in Osun State, yesterday, thronged major streets in Osogbo, the state capital, in celebration of the victory of the Governor Gboyega Oyetola at the Court of Appeal. The governor who called for calm as Adeleke headed for the Supreme Court, also joined them to rejoice as the appellate court upturned the verdict of the Osun State Election Petition Tribunal, which in its split judgement, declared PDP’s Ademola Adeleke as winner of the election. Oyetola was sighted in an open-roof car at the Olaiya Junction in Osogbo acknowledging cheers from his supporters and APC members who trooped out in large numbers immediately the judgement was delivered in Abuja. Reacting to the judgement, Oyetola said, “This is the judgement that the people of Osun have been waiting for. I am happy and the judgement is wonderful. This is what the people want to hear. They came out today without being prompted to rejoice and celebrate this judgment.” But the PDP in the state, through its Chairman, Soji Adagunodo, said the judgement of the Appeal Court was a huge shock. Adgunodo said, “We have hope in the judiciary, that does not mean that once in a while there won’t be some hiccups in the judicial process, it is understandable and expected that all judges are not the same and they don’t think the same and we believe that at the end of the day, the Supreme Court will do justice to our case and victory will be ours,” he said.
