The Ona of Abaji and Chairman of the FCT Council of Traditional Rulers, His Royal Majesty (HRM), Alhaji Adamu Baba Yunusa, on Saturday, hosted the Presidential Committee on the Elimination of Drug Abuse, calling for synergy among stakeholders. Alh. Yunusa emphasised the need for all stakeholders, including schools at all levels, to be ready to work together with commitment, cooperation and understanding to ensure a healthy citizenry. The committee, led by its Chairman, Brigadier General Buba Marwa (Rtd), was at the Onaâ€™s palace to solicit support from the chief. Alh. Yunusa further noted that since Abaji was the southern gateway to the FCT, it was expected by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) to expand and recognise its unit command with modern technology and adequate manpower. The traditional ruler said he and other chiefs across the territory were fully in support of the committee against drug abuse. Marwa urged the traditional ruler on the need to support the committee by educating and sensitising their subjects on dangers of drug abuse. On his part, the Chairman of the council, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, commended the committee for its visit to the council, saying his administration had always been supportive to the unit command of the NDLEA in the area.
