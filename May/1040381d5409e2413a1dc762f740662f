The Citizens Advocacy for Social and Economic Rights (CASER) has said INEC does not have any ground under the law to continue holding the certificate of Rochas Okorocha as senator-elect for Imo West. The group said INEC should quickly retrace its steps and issue Okorocha the certificate of return or face mass action. Speaking at a press conference in Abuja yesterday, Mr. Frank Tietie, who is the executive director of the group, said INEC’s action amounted to the subversion of democracy and the rule of law. He said an election could not be questioned based on the casual opinion of a returning officer or a national commissioner but by the relevant provisions of the law. “It is our expectation that INEC will reverse itself and save the unnecessary and endless rounds of litigation and allow the law to prevail by respecting the will and mandate of the people of Imo West. “We, therefore, reiterate our resolve as a group that will do everything legal and permissible under the law, including the adoption of mass action, to ensure that INEC remains independent, impartial and law-abiding. “We will not allow it to be hijacked, misled and misguided by corrupt and unscrupulous persons who are determined to subvert it as an important institution of the Nigerian state simply for personal and selfish vindictiveness.” Group threatens mass action against INEC over Okorocha's return certificate Imo West:  Returning Officer not under duress – Observers Certificate of Return: Group threatens protest over Okorocha Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
