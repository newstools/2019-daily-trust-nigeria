Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro says he has defeated an “attempted coup” by opposition leader Juan Guaidó. Dozens of National Guardsmen sided with the opposition in clashes on Tuesday that injured more than 100 people. But in a defiant TV address, President Maduro said Mr Guaidó had failed to turn the military against him. Mr Guaidó insists that Mr Maduro has lost control of the armed forces. The opposition leader called for more streets protests on Wednesday. “Today we continue,” he tweeted. “We will keep going with more strength than ever.” Mr Guaidó has been recognised as interim leader of Venezuela by many countries, including the US, the UK and most in Latin America. The US reiterated its support for Mr Guaidó on Wednesday, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying “military action is possible” if necessary.
