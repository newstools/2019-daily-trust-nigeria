Youths from the 21 local government areas of Kogi State under the aegis of Forum of Coordinators of National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) have donated N2 million to Gov. Yahaya Bello to enable him purchase his intent form for the November 2, gubernatorial election. Chairman of the forum, Comrade Abdullahi Adamu, who made the donation at the Government House in Lokoja yesterday, said the move was informed by the desire of the youths of Kogi State to sustain the present administration’s good programmes for the development of the entire state. Com. Adamu noted that the commitment of the present government to ensure a secured future for the youths of the state was unprecedented. He lauded the administration of Gov. Bello for its “gigantic developmental strides” which informed the yearning by the people of the state for him to run again, saying it was important to protect Kogi’s present proximity with the APC-led Federal Government. He, therefore, urged the governor to keep focus in moving the state forward irrespective of the criticisms from the opposition, assuring him of their resolve to mobilise youths from all parts of the state to vote massively for his second term. Reacting, the governor thanked the youths for their steadfast support for his administration, saying it was a “watershed and loud statement” of what the real desires of the youths were in Kogi State. The governor, who was represented by his Chief of Staff, Edward Onoja, said although he appreciated the gesture, he was not surprised by the overwhelming show of love as the mandate was “divinely given” in the first place, hence several “armies” were taking over the battle for Bello’s re-election aspiration.
