The Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Gida Mustapha, has urged the Cabinet Affairs Office (CAO) in the Office of the SGF (OSGF) to facilitate policy formulation and coordination among the tiers of government.   Mustapha made the call on Thursday in Abuja at the maiden meeting of Permanent Secretaries and Heads of CAOs at federal and state levels held in Abuja at the State House banquet Hall.   The event attended by the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation (HoCSF), Mrs. Winifred Oyo-Ita, also recorded three former Permanent Secretaries in the CAO, Ambassador John Gana, Dr. Roy Pedro Ugo and Barrister Georgina Ehuria bagging Award of Excellences.   The summit was themed, “Repositioning the Cabinet Affairs Offices for Effective Service Delivery.”   According to him, the call was to ensure that the executive councils, both at state and federal levels, were provided with the most effective and efficient policy options to move Nigeria forward.   He said that for the federal and state government to turn things around, the CAOs must support the government’s core business of formulating, implementing, tracking and accounting for policies and programme.   “Let me reiterate that policy making and management are the most sensitive and critical function of government at all levels. This requires core competences and capability from CAOs, saddled with the responsibilities of managing policy making and tracking process.   “Empirical evidence suggests that the development of any country largely depends on the policy options the government chooses and implements. Sound policy options bring about good public policies and effective service delivery where there is the political will to follow through to implementation,” Mustapha said.
