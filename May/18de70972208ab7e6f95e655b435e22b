Operatives of the Nigeria Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), have arrested a truck driver, Monday Michael, 46, and his conductor, Alex Adieli, 43, for allegedly trafficking in N20 million worth of cannabis. Our correspondent learnt that the suspects were arrested last Friday while attempting to bring into Lagos from Ondo the illicit substance concealed in a false compartment they had created in a MAN Diesel truck registration number JJJ 959 XN. The acting Lagos State Commander of the NDLEA, Barrister Fredrick Ezeorah, who confirmed the development, said that the operatives of the agency intercepted the truck about 1.30pm on Friday. Ezeorah said that when the agencyâ€™s operatives searched the truck, they discovered it to be laden with 150 bags of cannabis weighing 2.139 tons, with a street value of N20m. He attributed the achievement to intelligence gathered over a period of time on the activities of the two suspects persons, whom he said specialized in bringing such illicit substances into Lagos State. Ezeorah said that Michael admitted during interrogation by NDLEA officers that he had been in the business for many years without being caught. He was said to have appealed to the NDLEA to let him off the hook as he would desist from the business.
