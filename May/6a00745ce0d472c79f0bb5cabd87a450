The incoming Governor of Nasarawa State, Engr. Abdullahi Alhaji Sule, yesterday, appealed to members of the APC not to report him to his godfather, Umaru Tanko Al-Makura, who is rounding up his second term as governor today. Speaking during a valedictory session held at the Government House in Lafiya, the incoming governor who spoke in the presence of Al-Makura, said, “When I assume office as governor, anybody who has issues with my administration should come to me directly instead of reporting me to the godfather and outgoing Governor, Al-Makura. “I have seen a lot of situations where people were best of friends and ended up with big fights. In Lagos, Fashola and Tinubu had squabbles and nobody knew that Tinubu and Ambode would fall apart someday. “I am begging you to find ways to continue to strengthen the relationship between me and him (Al-Makura) and not to break it. “Gov. Umaru Al-Makura has delivered his mandate. I appeal to you to do the best thing to keep the relationship intact by coming to meet me directly if you have any advice, but don’t report me to him,” he said.
