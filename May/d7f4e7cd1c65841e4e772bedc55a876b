The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has said it is seeking for an alternative source of funding for education in the territory. The Permanent Secretary for the FCT administration, Mr. Chinyeaka Ohaa, stated this at a stakeholders conference on funding of public schools and skills acquisition centres organised by the Education Secretariat of the FCTA on Friday in Abuja. Mr. Ohaa said it had become imperative to seek for alternative ways of funding basic education in order to encourage parents in sending their children to school. He pointed out that the challenging economic situation in the country had forced many parents to withdraw their children from private institutions and enroll them in public schools, saying  the trend had made the school facilities to be  overstretched. “It is on this premise that we see the need to seek for alternative sources of funding outside government as government alone cannot and indeed should not be left alone to fund education,” he said.
