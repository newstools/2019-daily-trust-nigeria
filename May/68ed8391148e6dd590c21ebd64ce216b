Boabab Micro Finance Bank has disbursed loans worth N30 billion to about 120,000 customers in the last 10 years. This was disclosed by the bank’s Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Kazeem Olanrewaju, during the bank’s Customers’ Forum held in Abuja at the weekend. Dr. Olanrewaju disclosed that the outstanding in the bank’s loan book was about N7.5bn for about 27,000 customers. He said the bank planned to disburse about N30bn in 2019 and that so far it had disbursed about N5bn and about N25bn would be disbursed before the end of 2019. The Baobab boss said the loan recovery rate of the bank was very high and that the idea that customers did not pay back loans was not true. He said it took four days in average to process and disburse a loan in the bank and that customers were attached to portfolio managers to meet their needs. “We have our customer forum in each area that we have our business location: Lagos, Abuja and Kaduna. The whole idea is to be able to get a feel of what our customers think about our services,” he said. The bank opened operations in Abuja about six months ago.
