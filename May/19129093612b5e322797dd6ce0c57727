The Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC) in Bayelsa State has called on INEC to redeploy all its staff in the state to another state. The council alleged that most of the INEC staff had served in the state for long and had become too familiar with politicians. Chairman of IPAC in the state, Mr. Eneyi Zidougha, told journalists in Yenagoa yesterday that the call became necessary if the state must have a free, fair and credible governorship election on November 2, 2019. Mr. Zidougha alleged that members of IPAC in the state suspected that all INEC staff that served in the state since the inception of democracy in Bayelsa were always used as agents to perpetuate electoral fraud during elections. He said, “They have comprised to the extent that they are no longer doing what is healthy for our electoral process.” “I don’t want to talk about the money that has gone into their pockets. They have become too old in the system that they have contributed largely to the underdevelopment of the state,” he said. “Based on this, it is our role as advisory council to also advise INEC that this time around, for us to have a free, fair and credible governorship election without fraud in Bayelsa State, INEC needs to redeploy those staff that have been in the system for too long,” he added. 18 18 NEW IPAC: Leadership crisis and implication on Nigeria’s democracy 18 Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
