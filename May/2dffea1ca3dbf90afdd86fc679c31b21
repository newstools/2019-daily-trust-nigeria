* to revisit Uwais, other electoral reform reports The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has commenced the review of the 2019 General Elections as part of initiatives for planning for future elections. INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, said this on Tuesday in Abuja at the kickoff of post-2019 elections review meeting of the commission’s management and Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs). According to him, the Tuesday’s meeting was the first since the conclusion of the elections and after the last meeting where they met to review preparations for the 2019 elections. Yakubu also said that the Commission hopes that the recommendations arising from the national conversation will feed into an enduring reform of the nation’s electoral process. He said the commission would consider the reports of previous committees on electoral reform, over the last 40 years, including the Babalakin Commission of Inquiry into the affairs of the Federal Electoral Commission (FEDECO in 1986), the Uwais report on electoral reform (2008), the Lemu Committee on post-election violence (2011), and the Ken Nnamani Committee on constitutional and electoral reform (2017) among others.
