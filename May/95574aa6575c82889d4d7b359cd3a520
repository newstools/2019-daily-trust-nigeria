The crisis rocking the Imo State House of Assembly escalated yesterday following the resolve of members to serve the Speaker, Rt. Hon. Acho Ihim, notice of impeachment. A Member, Chinedu Ofor, has been appointed interim speaker. The action, which was carried out by 21 out of the 27 lawmakers came after Ihim escaped with the mace to prevent his colleagues from carrying out any action against him. Ihim had hurriedly adjourned plenary after reading a letter announcing the lifting of the suspension placed on the 27 local government chairmen by the state lawmakers last week. Ihim was alleged to have ordered his aides to switch off the generator supplying electricity to the complex. His actions drew the ire of his colleagues who announced his immediate suspension and issued him with notice of impeachment. The 21 lawmakers immediately announced Offor (Onuimo State Constituency, Action Alliance) as the interim speaker. They also announced the suspension of the Majority Leader, Lugard Osuji (Owerri Municipal) and elected Lloyd Chukwuemeka (Owerri North) to replace him. Ofor, who later addressed the press, quoted Order 15 of the House Rule, which empowers lawmakers to contribute to issues before the speaker ruled, stressing that the speaker did not allow any lawmaker to contribute on the matter. Osuji had objected to last weekâ€™s sack of the 27 local government chairmen by the house.
