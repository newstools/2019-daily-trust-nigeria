The House of Representatives yesterday abolished age discrimination against job seekers in Federal Government Ministries, Agencies and Departments (MDAs). This followed the passage, by the lawmakers, of a “Bill for an Act to Eradicate the Age Discrimination against Job seekers in Federal Government Agencies,” sponsored by Sergius Ogun (APC, Edo) and Babajimi Benson (APC, Lagos). The bill, which was read for the second time in 2018, subsequently passed third reading after unanimous adoption by the lawmakers and Speaker Yakubu Dogara. Ogun, moving a motion for third reading of the bill, said the new law seeks to ensure that no Nigerian job seeker is disqualified from government employment on the basis of age.
