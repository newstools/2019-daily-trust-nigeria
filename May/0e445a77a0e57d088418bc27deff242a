Leah Sharibu, celebrates her 16th birthday on Tuesday in a state of despair. She has been held captive by the Boko Haram for over 400 days as she refused to denounce her Christian faith. The insurgents refused to set her free when her mates were released. Sharibu was abducted on February 19, 2018 along with 111 other girls from Government Girls Science & Technical Secondary School Dapchi, in Yobe State. As the world joined in celebrating her birthday, a former Minister of Aviation and PDP spokesperson in the 2015 general elections took to his twitter handle, “May God continue to be with you, and may He grant her freedom from her cruel captors. Millions are with you and praying for you, O! Daughter of Zion. Blessed are those that are persecuted for their faith. In the fullness of time you shall prevail. Happy birthday Leah Sharibu.” Reno Omokri, a former special assistant to President Goodluck Jonathan on his twitter handle said, “You probably don’t know me but I know your mum and your dad. I have been going round the world, 19 countries this year alone telling people your story. I have been wearing my FREE LEAH SHARIBU clothing around the world. I wrote a book named ‘’Leah Sharibu, The Girl Boko Haram Left Behind, so you’re not forgotten’’. Also, Sen. Ali Ndume joined in celebrating her birthday saying that, “May the spirit of Ramadan touch the heart of your captors to release you as soon as possible in the spirit of this holy month‘’.
