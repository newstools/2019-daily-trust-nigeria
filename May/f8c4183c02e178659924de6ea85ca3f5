A former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, has faulted Sule Lamido for criticizing Former President Olusegun Obasanjo, saying the former Jigawa State governor could be one of those supporting the “Fulanization and Islamization agenda.” In a statement yesterday, Fani-Kayode said: “I hear one or two people, like Sule Lamido, are not too happy with what OBJ said and have called him out for saying it. That is sad and unfortunate because Obasanjo has done more for the core North, Lamido’s Fulani tribe and Nigerian unity than any other former president or head of state in our history. “He also fought in a civil war to keep the country together. For anybody from the core North to call him names for speaking the truth and baring his mind over what is unfolding in Nigeria today, it tells you how blinded by power, insensitive and callous some of these people are. “It is only those that subscribe to the Fulanisation and Islamisation agenda that will criticise or oppose Obasanjo’s observation and describe him as a ‘bigot’ for making them,” he said.
