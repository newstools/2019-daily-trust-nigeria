Chairmen of the APC in the six South South states have written President Muhammadu Buhari on the need to support Sen. Ovie Omo-Agege for the position of deputy senate president for the 9th Assembly. The South South APC chairmen said Omo-Agege was qualified for the position considering his pedigree. They said in the letter to the president that, “After a careful look at the political dynamics in our geo-political zone and the zoning formulae that your emergence has bestowed on us as a people, we have taken cognizance of the senators who will represent the South South in the 9th Senate, both their antecedents, background and suitability for the positions sought. “With a sense of responsibility, we do hereby convey to you our agreement to endorse Sen. Ovie Omo-Agege for the position of Deputy Senate President of the 9th Assembly. “Our choice has been majorly influenced (but not limited) by his loyalty to the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Your Excellency, the President and Commander in Chief, his proven capacity to support the president in the senate in executing your far-reaching programmes for the benefit of the Nigerian citizens,” they said. The chairmen that signed the letter are Jones Erue (Delta), Jonathan Lalabunafa (Bayelsa), John Ochala (Cross River), Ini T. Okopido (Akwa Ibom), Ojukaye Amachree (Rivers) and Anslem Ojezua (Edo). The letter was copied to the National Chairman of the party, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole.
