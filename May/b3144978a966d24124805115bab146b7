Police in southern Italy have arrested six youths and two adults suspected of torturing and robbing a 65-year-old man who later died in hospital. Prosecutors allege that the eight formed a “baby gang” – Italian slang for teenage gangs – called “the Orphanage Group”. They shared video clips of their assaults, it is alleged. The violence took place in Manduria, 47km (29 miles) east of Taranto. Antonio Cosimo Stano was reportedly mentally disabled and lived in fear.
