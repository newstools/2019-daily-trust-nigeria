The Lead Counsel to Mr. Nsima Ekere APC gubernatorial candidate in the March 9 governorship election in Akwa Ibom State, Chief Victor Iyanam, has accused INEC of frustrating the party from inspecting election materials as ordered by the tribunal. Speaking yesterday at a press conference in Uyo, Chief Iyanam said INEC was playing a script orchestrated by the PDP in a deliberate attempt to delay the inspection of election materials. He said the plan was to waste the six months period designated by law to handle electoral complaints cases, noting that the order issued by the tribunal since April 15, mandating INEC to allow the APC legal team to carry out the inspection was yet to be obeyed by the commission. He alleged that INEC had continued to give flimsy excuses to delay the inspection and frustrate the party from achieving its objectives. The lead counsel urged INEC to desist from playing the script of the PDP to unnecessarily delay them, and called on the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in the state, Mr. Mike Igini, to expedite action on the matter. The former Attorney General of the state said Ekereâ€™s chances of winning at the tribunal was very bright, adding that the inspection of materials would provide the needed evidence for the party to prove its case.
