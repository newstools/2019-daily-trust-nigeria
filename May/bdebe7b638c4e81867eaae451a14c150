A pressure group, Maje Support Forum, has said that electing Femi Gbajabiamila as Speaker and Ahmed Idris Wase as Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives in the 9th National Assembly will be a perfect combination that will move the country to greater heights. Convener of the group, Engr. Umar Saleh Abubakar, in a statement issued yesterday, said the duo of Gbajabiamila and Wase possessed the needed credentials and long years of legislative experience that would count in the business of representative democracy. Engr. Saleh said Gbajabiamila had been in the green chamber since 2003, while Wase had been there since 2007, adding that their long years of experience in the house gave them advantage over other lawmakers eyeing the position. “At present, Wase works with Gbajamiamila as the deputy majority leader, which in advanced country, all they need is promotion to serve the country more by way of using their experiences to lead the green chamber. “We are optimistic that the leadership of the green chamber under Hon. Femi and Wase will bring about the re-engineering of the 9th Assembly for a more robust executive-legislative relation capable of bringing about the most needed people-centered dividend of democracy in Nigeria. “As the house is to be inaugurated come June, we urge the elected honourable members to place national interest above personal ambitions as was the case during the 8th National Assembly,” he said. …Youth group insists on Wase Senate Presidency: Goje’s imminent entry brings new twist Ninth House: Meet Reps who want Dogara’s job Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
