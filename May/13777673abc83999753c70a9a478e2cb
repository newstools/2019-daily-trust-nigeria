The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) said it recorded a trade surplus of N15.04 billion for January 2019, an increase of 24 per cent over the N12.13bn surplus posted by the corporation in December 2019. NNPC spokesman, Mr. Ndu Ughamadu, who stated this in a statement in Abuja yesterday said details of the report is contained in the January 2019 edition of the corporation’s Monthly Financial and Operations Report (MFPR). He attributed the positive financial position to the improved performance of NNPC’s upstream subsidiary, Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC), which recorded surplus numbers despite reduced operational activities in the month. The report submitted that NPDC’s sustained revenue drive, evident from recent average weekly production of 332,000 barrels of Crude Oil per day, had made achieving 500,000bpd production by 2020 possible. The NPDC’s position contrasts with the high expenditure levels posted by two other entities of NNPC, the Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC) and Duke Oil, although both ended the month with profit. In terms of sales and remittance of crude oil and gas proceeds, the corporation announced total export receipts of $381.70 million in the month under review as against $345.68m posted in December 2018. A breakdown of the numbers indicated that contributions from crude oil amounted to $269.43m, while Gas and miscellaneous receipts stood at $111.75 and $0.52m respectively. In the downstream operations, 1,998.61 million litres of petrol was supplied into the country through the Direct-Sale-Direct-Purchase (DSDP) crude-for-product arrangement in January 2019.  The number is slightly higher than the 1,789.20m litres of petrol supplied in the month of December 2018. The report showed that the corporation recorded 230 hacked pipeline points, leaving only two ruptured, marking an 11 per cent improvement from the 264 vandalized points posted in December 2018.
