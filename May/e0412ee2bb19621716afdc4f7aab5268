Some stakeholders of the APC in Kogi State have debunked reports that Gov. Yahaya Bello is planning to dump the party ahead of the November 2, 2019, governorship election. Leader of the stakeholders, Dr. Shuaibu Umar Oricha, in a statement issued yesterday in Lokoja, described the rumour as “blatant falsehood manufactured by some Abuja-based politicians who are losing ground in their desperate attempt to return to power at all cost.” Dr. Oricha, who is also the Director General of Government House Administration, said Bello never contemplated joining the Accord Party (AP) as being insinuated in some quarters. He also said the governor had at no time ordered the removal of APC flags from the government house, adding that those behind the sponsored reports aimed at hoodwinking the populace should find better jobs to do. According to him, the governor had demonstrated his political strength in the just concluded elections by delivering the state to President Buhari; won two out of three senate seats; seven out of nine House of Representatives seats and clinched all the 25 seats in the state assembly. He, therefore, urged the APC family and its teeming supporters to discard the rumour and continue to work for the re-election of Gov. Bello come November 2.
