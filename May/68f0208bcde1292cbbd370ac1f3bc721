There was pandemonium at the Polytechnic Ibadan on Tuesday evening as cult groups engaged in a gun duel. Eyewitness told our correspondent that many students were left injured, while some private and commercial vehicles were vandalised. Pieces of broken glasses and bottles littered the security office at the main entrance of the school when our correspondent visited the school on Wednesday evening. The students, had just resumed after about five-week compulsory holiday imposed on them by the school management. Another source told our correspondent that the students were protesting N2,000 levy imposed on them for the damages recently incurred on the school campus and they were not cultists. The management of the institution had, in a letter, directed all the students to pay a sum of N2,000 to fix some affected facilities during a recent fracas in the school. A statement to that effect was signed by the Registrar of the institution, Mrs Modupe Fawale. It read: “Each student on resumption is to pay a reparation fee of N2000 for the enormous damages of the institution’s facilities. The students will also, among other things, swear to an affidavit to be of good conduct while those residing in neighboring communities would sign a bond with their landlords to be of good conduct and worthy ambassador of the institution. Each student is also to write an undertaking to be of utmost good conduct.” The Oyo state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Gbenga Fadeyi, when contacted, said he was yet to be briefed about the incident.
