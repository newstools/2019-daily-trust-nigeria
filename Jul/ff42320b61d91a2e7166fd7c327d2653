The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) yesterday urged former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and PDP presidential candidate to wait for the outcome of the Presidential Election Petitions Tribunal before making comments. The National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee (IVEC), Festus Okoye told Daily Trust on telephone last night that Atiku, having taken his case to the tribunal should allow the law to take its full course. According to him, it was important for everyone to allow the election petitions tribunal complete its assignment and the law to take its full course. “As far as the commission is concerned, the Presidential Election Petitions Tribunal should be allowed to its job especially that the former vice president has closed his case at the tribunal,” Okoye said.
