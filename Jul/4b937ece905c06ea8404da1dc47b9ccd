African Democratic Congress (ADC) in Oyo State, yesterday, faulted the withdrawal of the candidate of the party in the last gubernatorial election, Senator Olufemi Lanlehin, from the alliance with the People Democratic Party (PDP). The party said ADC, its teeming members, and supporters across the state are solidly in continued support of the governor, “believing that we are on the same page.” A letter addressed to the state governor, Seyi Makinde, and signed by the former secretary to the state government, on behalf of the party, Chief Busari Adebisi, said “stakeholders of the party have not abandoned the original leitmotifs, especially good governance for the people of the state which was the basis of the alliance.” OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY.
