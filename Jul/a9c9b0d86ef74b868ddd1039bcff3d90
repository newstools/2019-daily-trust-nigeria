Justice P.I. Ajoku of the Federal High Court in Ibadan has granted the prayer of the NYSC to bring in Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) as a joinder in a
suit instituted by the immediate past Communication Minister, Mr Adebayo Shittu, against the corps. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Shittu had in December 2018 told the court that the NYSC was basically responsible for why he did not participate in the compulsory one year service after his graduation. The former minister was a graduate of the then University of Ife, now OAU. OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYMDROM DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY.

The defence counsel, Mr O.B. Omuru, had tendered an application seeking to have OAU as a joinder since it was the institution where Shittu graduated from. At the resumption of hearing on Tuesday, Ajoku who cited many sections of the law to support her ruling, granted the prayer of NYSC to have OAU as a joinder in the matter. “Anybody or party who is interested in a case can be a joinder as long as the contribution of the joinder will add value to the matter,” the judge said. She adjourned the case till Oct.30 for continuation of hearing. Other respondents in the matter include Oyo State NYSC Coordinator, NYSC Director-General and the Attorney-General of the Federation.
