The Speaker of the Kwara State House of Assembly, Yakubu Danladi Salihu, has called on Nigerian youths to see themselves more as Nigerians rather than prioritising their ethnic or religious affinities to gain advantage. Rt. Hon. Salihu made the call during the Kwara NYSC Batch B, Stream 1 carnival, where he, alongside other members of the assembly, visited the state’s Yikpata Orientation Camp in Edu Local Government Area of the state. While charging the corps members on unity, he said, “Nigeria needs unity now more than ever, we must deemphasise our socio-cultural and religious inclinations and see ourselves as Nigerians if we must progress. We must be ready to take charge of the future, and to do that, we must be detribalised.” OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY.
