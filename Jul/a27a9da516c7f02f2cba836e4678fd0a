President Muhammadu Buhari has condemned the deadly airstrike on a migrant centre near Tripoli, Libya yesterday. The President described as “inhuman, wicked and callous” such an attack on “helpless and defenceless people.” Buhari, who called for an international investigation, said those behind the death and injury of scores of migrants must be made to face justice. “The unfortunate attack is a wake-up call to the warring factions in Libya and the international community to quickly restore peace and stability in the beleaguered country,” he was quoted in a statement by his media aide, Garba Shehu. He prayed to God to comfort grieving families and grant speedy healing to the injured. OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY.
