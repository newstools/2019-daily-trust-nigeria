Yunus Ustaz, SAN, says his life has been threatened by unknown persons for simply representing his client at the National Assembly tribunal in Kaduna. Ustaz is the counsel to Lawal Adamu Usman popularly known as Mr LA, the candidate of the PDP for Kaduna Central Senatorial zone who is challenging the victory of Uba Sani of the APC. The lawyer spoke at the weekend in Kaduna ‎shortly after some suspected thugs attacked his client at the venue of the tribunal sitting. He, however, said he could not be intimidated because he had been attending tribunals since 1983 and was used to things like that. Armed thugs had pounced on Mr La as he was leaving the courtroom on Saturday.‎ It took the concerted effort of security and the petitioner’s supporters to save him from the thugs. “I am not surprised at all with what happened in court because as early as 5am, some people were calling me and hiding their phone numbers. “They were threatening that if I make a mistake of going to the court, I will not come back alive. So, I told them that if they are the owners of that life, they should come and take it. “So, when we were at the tribunal, a senior lawyer from my team was coming in and observed that some thugs came in a Golf car with weapons. “When he told me that, I reported back to the tribunal which confirmed it. I also went to see them. The tribunal quickly called on the security and they drove away. But I’m used to these things,” he said.
