Several hours of downpour yesterday submerged many houses in more than four estates in Lokogoma District of the FCT. Flooding in the district has become perennial and authorities have identified poor drainage system as the cause. Some of the affected residents said houses in EFAB, Bethel Jubilation, Ipent and PENGASSAN estates were affected by the flood and that property worth millions of naira were destroyed. A resident of EFAB, Habeeb Abdulkadir, said 38 houses were affected by the flood in June, “and this one has gone further down the estate, it has affected more than 38 houses. “It is really devastating. It is worse than the last one; the damage is increasing. This time it fell fences, removed windows, cracked walls, removed electricity poles. So much devastation for one day, but no life was lost,” he said. Most of the houses affected are on First Avenue and its connecting streets. Some of the residents said officials of the Federal Fire Service and the Development Control Department of the Abuja Metropolitan Management Council (AMMC) were in the estate but could do nothing about the flood. The Chairman of EFAB Estate Lokogoma Landlords Forum, Alhaji Shettima Gana Mohammed, said the extent of the damage could not be ascertained until the water subsided.
