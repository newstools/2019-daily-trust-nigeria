Health workers in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) are being trained on sign language as part of efforts to improve the access to critical health services, such as maternity care for deaf women. The Chairperson of the Deaf Women’s Association of Nigeria (DWAN), Hellen Beyioku-Alase, who spoke at the launch of the programme yesterday in Abuja, said the purpose of the programme was to provide basic health sign language training for health practitioners in the FCT so they would be prepared to meet the special needs of deaf women and girls. The representative of the FCT Health and Humans Services and Director Special Duties, Dr Mathew Ashikeni  said the training was key to improving access to health care services for persons with deafness or impaired hearing and will go a long way in fulfilling the vision of the FCT administration for equitable health-care services for all the people in the FCT. “Access to health care without barriers is a clearly well-defined rights of people with disabilities as stated by the UN Convention on the rights of People with Disabilities.” Ashikeni said One of the trainees and a nurse from the Kubwa General Hospital, Nwarjwa Miracle Oluchi, said the training was going to be beneficial as it would help them communicate with patients who are deaf.
