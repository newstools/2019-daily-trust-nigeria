The Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) says the cabinet list released by President Muhammadu Buhari is a product of good thinking. The group which thumbed up the president, said he gave due attention to merit, hard work and loyalty. In a statement signed by its chairman, Niyi Akinsiju and Secretary, Cassidy Madueke, BMO said the list containing 43 names had people who had all it would take to assist the president to achieve his second-term goals. The group said the list contained a good mix of technocrats, achievers and loyal members of the All Progressives Congress (APC). “President Buhari’s list is clearly populated by loyal party members who are professionals in their own right. And although a few of them were part of the last cabinet, we are convinced that they were outstanding in their contributions to the overall success of the Buhari administration. “We also acknowledge that the newcomers have a good pedigree in their own right and have excelled in the private and public sectors, coupled with the role they played in the process that led to the re-election of the president. “The seven female ministerial nominees, including at least one former senator and a deputy governor, are well-known politicians who have paid their dues and are well placed to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the men on the cabinet list,” the statement said.
