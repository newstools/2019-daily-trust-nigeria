The Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) chapter of the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) and Non Academic Staff Union (NASU) yesterday pledged to join their national body in a nationwide strike over the nonpayment of their earned allowance by the federal government. Briefing our correspondent on the outcome of the unionsâ€™ emergency congresses, the chairman of the SSANU-ABU, Shuaibu Halilu, said the federal government had been discriminating against the unions in disbursing funds to universities. He added it is unfair for the federal government to disburse funds to universities and make direct allocation of 80% to the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) while allocating only 20% to non-academic staff of the universities.
