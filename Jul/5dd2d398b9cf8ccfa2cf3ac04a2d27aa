The Director of FCT Muslim Pilgrims’ Welfare Board, Malam Muhammad Bashir, has said a total of 2,220 pilgrims will be airlifted from the FCT to Saudi Arabia. The director stated this when the FCT Permanent Secretary, Sir Chinyeaka Ohaa, addressed intending pilgrims at the FCT Permanent Hajj camp at Bassan Jiwa, Abuja, preparatory to their airlift. He also disclosed that in a bid to ensure a hitch-free and successful Hajj operation, the board introduced some innovations which include the education and orientation programmes for the pilgrims as well as improved medical screenings like pregnancy tests as well as immunizations. The director also advised the intending pilgrims to be “law-abiding and strictly abide by the transport system and feeding arrangements, luggage policy as well as flight schedules. He implored them to “be patient always, avoid rumour mongering, be responsive and avoid reckless spending and above all, have the fear of Allah (SWT) and remember the purpose of the journey.” The permanent secretary said the FCTA had as usual displayed the utmost commitment to ensuring that the intending pilgrims got the best possible treatment in the holy land. This commitment to excellence, Ohaa said, had earned the FCT the title of the best state pilgrims’ welfare board for two consecutive years – 2017 and 2018. 2015 Hajj: FCT Muslim pilgrims’ board warns staff against corruption 2019 Hajj: FCT board warns intending pilgrims against fraudulent acts 2017 hajj: FCT pilgrims airlift begins this weekend Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
