Aregbesola stated this when he appeared before the Senate during the ministerial screening. He said he would recommend a serious tax against wealthy Nigerians. Aregbesola, a nominee from Osun state said he would pioneer “privilege taxes” for those who have huge resources. If confirmed, Aregbesola said, “I will advocate for a just taxation system that will bridge the inequality in the system.” He said disparity in the payment of salaries during his reign in Osun state was stopped in July 2018 before the expiration of his tenure in November.
