The Federal Government has granted approval for the full Field Development Plan (FDP) and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to Green Energy International Limited (GEIL) the operator of Otakikpo marginal field in Oil Mining Lease (OML) 11, to enable the company implement the Phase 2 development of the field. These approvals by the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), the regulator of the oil and gas industry, are coming on the heels of the recent memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed by the company for a financing package of over $350 million dollars from international financiers. The approved FDP consists of drilling of additional seven wells, expanding crude processing infrastructure, construction of a 1.3 million barrels onshore terminal and the construction of a 17km export pipeline connecting the terminal to an offshore loading system. The company plans to significantly increase production from 6000 barrels per day (bpd) to 20,000 bpd. A statement by the company’s Director, Corporate Affairs, Olusegun Ilori, said the EIA approval also gave the company the nod for its environmentally compliant plans to develop the field with due regard to  international best practices in the protection of the environment and the ecosystem. GEIL Chairman Prof. Anthony Adegbulugbe said DPR’s approval complements the efforts of the operator in attracting the necessary financing to unlock potentials of the field and boost investors’ confidence in the project.
