A yet to be ascertained number of persons are feared killed in a tribal war in Ajah community, a riverine community, in  Eti-Osa Local Government Area of Lagos. It was gathered that the crisis erupted between some Ilaje youths and a rival group who claimed to be the owners of the fast developing area of Ajah. Several others have also sustained varying degree of wounds since the renewed war started two weeks ago. It is not too clear as to the reason for the fight; police source told City Trust that there is heightened tension in the area over who actually is the owner of the vast riverine community. Though, the police had kept mum over the two weeks long fracas, the state Commissioner of Police, Zubairu Muazu, visited to the area at the weekend. The source said that the move by the commissioner is to bring an end to the fight between youths in the community. Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, confirmed that Muazu, accompanied by other senior Police officers, visited Ajah and Ilaje communities. “Leaders of the two warring communities applauded the steps taken by the Commissioner of Police in restoring lasting peace to the communities and promise to support the peace building initiatives. They called on their followers to give peace a chance” he added.
