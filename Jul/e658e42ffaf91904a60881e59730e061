The member representing Idah Federal Constituency in Kogi State, David Zacharias, has denied reports that he has collapsed his campaign structure to support an Igala candidate within the APC ahead of the November 16 governorship elections in the state. The lawmaker in a statement yesterday by his spokesperson, Mr. Jeremiah Ocheme, said the comments in the social media were only an imagination of the authors. According to the statement, at no time the lawmaker  contemplated leaving Governor Yahaya Bello, let alone dissolving the campaign support group that saw him into office to any politician in the state. “If anyone has to inherit Zacharias’ support group, it should be Kogi State Governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, whose contributions to the lawmaker’s political career he described as legendry,” he said. He said that members of his support group were anxiously waiting for campaigns to commence so that they would use the platforms to draw support for the governor, not any other candidates in the APC.
