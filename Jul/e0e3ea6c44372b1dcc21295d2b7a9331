The duo of Olubayo Oluwaseyi, (aka Rachel Erick), and Abe Tolulope Emmanuel, (a.k.a. Victoria Grant), were found guilty of fraudulent impersonation, sending pornographic and indecent pictures in a charge filed against them by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibadan zonal office. Due to the plea bargain agreement between the accused and the commission, the original charges were replaced with amended charges as presented before the court on Monday. They pleaded guilty to the latest charges when they were read to them. After the pleas, the prosecution counsel, Iyabo Daramola, prayed the court to convict and sentence them accordingly. In delivering her judgment, Justice Ajoku, upheld the terms in the respective plea bargain agreements as she sentenced Olubayo to six months in prison, and jailed Abe for five months. The convicts were also ordered to restitute to their victims, the money they fraudulently collected from their victims, and also to forfeit all the items recovered from them to the Federal government of Nigeria.  2 fraudsters sentenced to 8 months over cyber-crime Court jails 2 internet fraudsters in Ibadan Graduate bags 4 months jail term for internet fraud Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
