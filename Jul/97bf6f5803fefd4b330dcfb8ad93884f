Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) said, yesterday, that the visa restriction order imposed on a category of Nigerian politicians by the United States government, which “clearly exonerated the present administration in the country” is another indication of President Muhammadu Buhari’s acceptance and popularity in the comity of nations. BMO said it was instructive that the United States was taking the step in spite of efforts by opposition figures led by PDP presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar, “to turn the US government against the newly elected government with false narratives.” In a statement signed by its chairman, Niyi Akinsiju and secretary, Cassidy Madueke, the organisation said the US State Department’s position showed the futility of the opposition’s efforts to demonise the government before, during and after the 2019 elections. “We acknowledge the decision by the American government to impose visa ban on individuals responsible for undermining the last electoral process or organising election-related violence,” the statement said. “It is in line with a warning the US issued before the election, and we note that it is within the rights of the Americans to do so. “And by making it clear that the actions are not directed at the government that emerged from the process, the US has tacitly cleared the Buhari administration of involvement in acts of political violence in spite of efforts by lobbyists engaged by the PDP to taint the president’s victory,” the statement said. 2019: BMO hails US group’s victory prediction for Buhari Buhari is in charge, BMO replies Tambuwal 2019: Coalition protest at embassy over US Visa for Atiku Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
