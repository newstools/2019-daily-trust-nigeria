This comes after the recently concluded Nigeria-China Belt and Road Investment Forum which took place in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China, organized by the Consulate General of Nigeria in Shanghai, alongside the Shanghai Golden Consulting Company Limited. The Consul General, Hon. Anderson Madubike, said the Nigerian consulates increased and improved commitment in sustaining the bilateral trade and investment between the two countries. Madubike also stated that it was part of the Nigerian’s government mandate to reach out in line of the diversification of the economy of the country. The Nigerian Ambassador to China, Baba Ahmed Jidda in a statement also made note of the 48 years of bilateral relations between Nigeria and China, and has continued to grow substantially over the years.
