After the charges were read to them, they pleaded not guilty. The defendantsâ€™ counsel, Mr Osaze Ebie, moved to apply for bail for his clients. But the trial Judge, Justice Salisu Garba, informed him that the annual court vacation will begin on Monday and there would be no time to rule in the bail application. He gave him options, saying, take the application to a vacation judge or wait until the court resumes from its vacation. Garba then adjourned until Oct. 8 for hearing after the Ebie (defence counsel) told the court that he would go to the vacation court to seek for their bail. The judge however, ordered that the defendants be remanded in the prison custody pending the determination of their bail application.
