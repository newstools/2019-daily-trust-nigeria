The Chairman of the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), Abdullahi Adamu Candido, has urged Nigerians living in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to be law abiding and go about their daily activities peacefully. The chairman, during a security  meeting on Tuesday, said the council would not transit to the next level of development if Nigerians failed to promote harmonious relationship irrespective of their diversities. Hee said, “My appeal to the residents of AMAC is to please go about their normal businesses and support government institutions with information that can assist to ensure that we find lasting solution to crises around the nation’s capital city; which is the seat of government. We believe that the residents of this council can go to bed with our eyes closed.” Candido further  said residents should support government institutions with information that could assist them in finding a lasting solution to crises within the city centre. Despite the challenges, he said residents could still go to bed comfortably. Also, the Chief of Jikwoyi, Bawa Jetta, said security was  a collective responsibility. “We believe that with the briefing by the AMAC chairman, we will go back to our various communities to keep watch, to talk to our people and create a kind of sensitisation for unity. “It’s our duty to make sure that peace reigns in our domains. We want to call on every Nigerian to support this idea in our locality, so we should not go back and relax,” he said.
