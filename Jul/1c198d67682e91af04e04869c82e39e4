Two opposition parties in Cross River State, All Progressives Congress (APC) and African Action Congress (AAC), have warned Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State against his resolve to tamper with the local government funds. This strong advice came on Wednesday on the heels of the governor’s secret meeting with heads of local government administration (HOLGA) where he appealed to them to allow him continue to use the funds to pay workers’ salaries. Sources close to Ayade said the HOLGA had refused to heed the plea from the governor. OVER 5,000 NIGERIAN MEN HAVE  OVERCOME POOR BEDROOM PERFORMANCE SYNDROME DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY.
