The Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Kano has refused the application by the PDP and its candidate to call their first witness to give testimony. Counsel to the petitioners, A. J. Awonikoko (SAN), applied to call Dr Umar Tanko Yakasai as the first witness to be presented before the tribunal, and he was already in the witness box awaiting an oath to be administered on him. However, counsel to the first respondent, Barr. Dayo Adedeji, objected to the application, arguing that the person in question was part of the list of eight persons that the petitioners applied to add to their list of witnesses, a motion that was dismissed by the tribunal on July 16. Also objecting to the application, counsel to the 2nd respondent, Offiong Offiong (SAN), adopted the position of the 1st respondent adding that what the petitioners were trying to do was a “flagrant violation and disrespect to the order of this honourable court.” Responding, counsel to the petitioners, Awonikoko argued that what they did was not an attempt to repeat the application that was dismissed on July 16. In her ruling, Justice Halima S. Muhammad said the tribunal would not go back on its ruling of July 16, hence refused the application of the petitioners to call the witness in question based on the provisions of paragraph 4(5)(A) of the Electoral Act 2010 as amended.
