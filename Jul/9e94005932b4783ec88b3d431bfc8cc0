The Senate’s Deputy Minority Whip, Sahabi Alhaji Ya’u, has assured that the 9th National Assembly, the Senate in particular, will not abandon the people of Zamfara State in the face of their security challenges. Sen. Ya’u, in an interview on Wednesday in Abuja, also applauded Monday’s ruling of the Supreme Court which turned down a request by the APC to review its earlier judgement on Zamfara State lawmakers (state and national), as well as the governor. According to him, the judgement was victory for democracy and affirmation that the judiciary was the last hope of the common man. He assured that the current leadership of the Senate and the National Assembly would stop at nothing within the law to ensure that Zamfara State and all states under different forms of attacks were properly accommodated in terms of specific budgetary provisions and other forms of parliamentary interventions. He commended Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila for visiting Zamfara State for an on-the-spot assessment of the situation and expressed joy over the steps taken by the Gov. Bello Mutawalle in collaboration with security operatives in ensuring that relative peace returned to the state. The senator also commended Gov. Mutawalle for coming with the dialogue option as the surest modality to bring banditry and other criminal elements to see need to abandon their old ways.
