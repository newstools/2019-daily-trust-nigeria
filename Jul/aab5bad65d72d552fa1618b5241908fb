An aspirant for the ticket of the PDP ahead of the November 16, governorship election in Bayelsa State, Anthony George Ikoli (SAN), has said he will not accept the outcome of the primary if tainted or manipulated. Ikoli who obtained his expression of interest and nomination forms yesterday at the PDP National Secretariat in Abuja, told newsmen that the number of aspirants seeking the ticket was not a worrisome development, but that party leaders must work hard to conduct a free, fair and transparent primary. He said he would abide by the decision of the party on having a consensus candidate if the need arose, but stressed that he was the best person for the ticket on grounds of his wealth of political experience and a “unique blueprint” he had for the state. “There is no anxiety about the number of aspirants coming from the state. But I believe I am the best. I will accept the outcome of the primary if it is free and fair. It is when the process is tainted or manipulated that aspirants can have the locus to challenge it. “But the party has assured that there will be a level playing field, free and transparent primary,” he said. He promised to improve on the welfare of citizens, curb youth restiveness and deliver good governance to the people of the state if elected.
