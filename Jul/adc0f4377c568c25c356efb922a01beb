The PDP in Akwa Ibom State has said negligence in prosecution was responsible for the failure of the APC at the election petitions tribunal in the state. The APC had accused Hon. Justice Jennifer Mbalamen Ijohor, Chairman of Panel 2 of the National and State Houses of Assembly Election Petitions of bias and sought that she recused herself from the tribunal on the grounds that her husband, Prof. Anthony Ijohor (SAN), is a PDP stalwart and Secretary to the Benue State Government (SSG). The APC claimed that Justice Ijohorâ€™s position as chairman of the tribunal was a clear conflict of interest in her work, arguing that she would not be able to discharge her duties as objectively as expected; which led to the dismissal of some cases.
