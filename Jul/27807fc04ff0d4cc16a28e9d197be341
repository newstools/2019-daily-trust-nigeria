Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, on Wednesday, told his colleagues that the Senate may get the list of ministerial nominees of President Muhammadu Buhari before this week runs out. Lawan, who was speaking at the plenary after a Point of Order was raised by Sen Albert Bassey Akpan (PDP, A/Ibom), said the Executive arm was working very hard on the ministerial list.
