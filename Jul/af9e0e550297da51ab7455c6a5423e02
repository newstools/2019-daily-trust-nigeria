He is presently undergoing medical examination at the medical unit of the service. “His picture is unfortunately going viral in the social media with a wrong narrative that he came to take over office from the CGC. This is not correct as it is just a pure medical case.” How Customs officer promoted self, caused drama at Hameed Ali's office Customs board confirms 4 mgt staff, 1,997 promotions Customs retires 34 officers Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
