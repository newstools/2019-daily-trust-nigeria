The Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF), has said troops of the MNJTF and national troops on Monday killed 10 terrorists of the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) in Baga, Borno State. The spokesman of the MNJTF, Colonel Timothy Antigha said the terrorists met their waterloo during a surprise dawn attack, at about 5:30 am this morning. He said the ISWAP terrorists numbering about 30 attempted to attack the troop’s defensive location in Baga. “However, vigilant troops spotted their approach and promptly thwarted what could have been an audacious assault,” he added. He said in the process, 10 terrorists, including four suicide bombers, were neutralized. Others escaped with gunshot wounds, as blood-stained tracks were observed. He also said assorted arms and ammunition were impounded from other terrorists who fled in disarray, adding that, “Unfortunately, a soldier paid the supreme, while 5 others sustained varying injuries and have been evaluated for medical attention.” Antigha said, the MNJTF acting with national forces will continue to pursue action necessary for the achievement of its mandate in the Lake Chad Basin.
