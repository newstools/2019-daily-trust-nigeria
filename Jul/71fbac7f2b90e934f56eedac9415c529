An Igbosere, Lagos, chief magistrate court yesterday sentenced a security guard to a four-month jail term for threat against his employer. Magistrate A. A. Famobiwo sentenced Jesse Lambala to a month jail term on each of the four-count criminal charge the police levelled against him. Each jail term is to run concurrently. The police told the court that Lambala was employed by Benny Obaze as a security guard from January to March 2019 at No. 10, Abayomi Fatosi Close, Parkview Estate, Ikoyi, Lagos. He was said to have started demanding the sum of N250,000 persistently from his employer when he got to know that Obaze had just sold one of his landed properties. Obaze thereafter invited the security men in the area, who reported the matter to the police to avert any problem. The court heard that on March 30, 2019, at about 10am at Obaze’s residence, the convict unlawfully threatened to eliminate the life of his contrary, contrary to Section 56 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State 2015. The court held that Lambala, on the same date, time and place, conducted himself in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace by scandalizing Obaze’s name within the Park View Estate neighbourhood.
