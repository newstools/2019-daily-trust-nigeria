The immediate past Managing Director of the Kano State Broadcasting Corporation, Umar Saidu Tudun Wada, died yesterday in an accident near Kura town along the Kano-Zaria Road. His funeral prayer, led by Sheikh Ibrahim Khalil, was conducted at his residence, behind Sahad Store, Zoo Road, Kano. The prayer was attended by Senator Ibrahim Shekarau, Professor Abdalla Uba Adamu, heads of media organizations in Kano, among other dignitaries. Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Abba Anwar,  sympathised with the people of Kano and the deceased’s family. Ganduje said Wada’s death was a great loss that left wide vacuum in the media practice in the state and the country as a whole. “Not only his families, the state and the media profession would forever remember him as an Icon who left when we all needed him the most,” the governor said. He described Wada, as a complete gentleman whose clean character shaped many promising media men and women in the state and beyond. “With Umar Sa’id Tudunwada, media ethics were carefully adhered to and other practitioners copied character and characteristics of a rare gem,” governor said. Wada had served as media aide to Ganduje and former Governor Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso.
