The Managing Director of the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN), Architect Ahmed Dangiwa, has said Nigeria needs N56 trillion to provide for the 17 million housing deficit in the country. Ahmed was speaking while he received the CEO of Shelter Afrique, Andrew Chimphondah and his team in the bank’s headquarters in Abuja yesterday. “Our 17 million housing deficit is an opportunity to grow the economy by the injection of over N56 trillion based on average price of 3.5 million per housing unit. I crave your indulgence for us to jointly  revisit the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in January 2017 by which Shelter Afrique was to invest $2 billion over the next decade at $200 million annually as credit for construction finance to Nigerian real estate developers,” Dangiwa said. He further stated that FMBN role was to provide mortgage loans under its  NationalHousing Fund (NHF) Scheme. The CEO of Shelter Afrique Andrew Chimphondah said it shares the same vision of providing affordable housing to citizens like that of FMBN and will collaborate with the bank to reduce the housing deficit in the Nigeria. “We need to build houses that are affordable so that more people can stay in houses, come out of slums and live in decent affordable houses, homes,” Chimphondah said. He said with the Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) which is a lightweight, precast, foam concrete building material suitable for producing concrete masonry unit (CMU) like blocks, more affordable houses could be built.
