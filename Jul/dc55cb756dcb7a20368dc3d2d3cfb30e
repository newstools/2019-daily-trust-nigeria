The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has closed its defence against the petition filed by the PDP and its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. INEC, however, did not call any witness, as its Counsel, Yunus Ustaz Usman (SAN), said it had no need to do so. “We have painstakingly reviewed evidence by petitioners’ witnesses,” Usman said. “We painstakingly studied petitioners’ witnesses on that cross examination which supports our defence and denial in consonance with our pleadings. “We do not see the need to waste your lordships’ precious time in repeating what their own witnesses have admitted. In consequence, we will not call any witness to help them for their case. “We, therefore, rely in the evidence of their witnesses under cross examination,” Usman said. Counsels to Buhari, Wole Olanipekun (SAN); and the APC, Lateef Fagbemi (SAN), did not oppose the submission, while PDP’s Counsel, Levy Uzoukwu (SAN), thanked the commission for saving the tribunal six days. INEC had initially proposed to call 84 witnesses and tender documents to prove that the election was conducted in accordance with the Electoral Act, while objecting to the existence of a server, which the PDP claimed result of the February 23, presidential election was transmitted. Among other issues, INEC had also contended that Atiku and PDP’s petition was incompetent for the non-joinder in the petition of persons listed in allegations of electoral malpractices such as Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, military and police chiefs.
