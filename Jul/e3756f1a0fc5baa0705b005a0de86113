The Lagos State Public Works Corporation (LSPWC) says it has commenced full-scale repair and rehabilitation of roads across the state in fulfilment of the ‘Executive Order on Zero Tolerance’ for potholes as declared by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. The LSPWC General Manager, Engineer Olufemi Daramola, who disclosed this yesterday during an inspection tour of the ongoing rehabilitation of Iju Road, said the Corporation had been providing palliatives with the use of boulders and crush stones on strategic roads across the state to ensure free flow of traffic. Daramola said, “In line with the Executive Order, we had to fix our plants and put some equipment and logistics in place, but the rain had slowed down our speed of delivery. However, things are getting better and we will go all out to enforce the governor’s directive because he feels the pain of the people and commuters across the state.” He added road rehabilitation work was already ongoing in 26 different locations that included Oke-Afa Isolo, Ejigbo, Ikotun-Ijegun axis, Oba Sekumade and Bayeku roads at Ikorodu, Iddo inward Idumota, Ahmadu Bello Way, Alfred Rewane Road, Oba Ogunusi road (Grammar School section), Ikeja under-bridge and Oguntolu/George Street (Shomolu). Daramola stated that because the LSPWC was not unaware of public expectation on the state of the roads across Lagos State, the Corporation and its personnel had been operating day and night shifts on road rehabilitation and maintenance, “especially as the weather remains unpredictable.”  We repaired 282 roads in 6 months – LSPWC Major construction projects ongoing despite 2019 budget delay — Berger Lagos unveils roadmap to fix potholes, tackle flooding Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
