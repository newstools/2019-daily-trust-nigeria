Agents of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) have disclosed that they were instructed to keep codes issued to them for transmission of results of the February 23 presidential election confidential. Ogunsanya Abiola and Uchenna Peter Umeh, who served as Assistant Polling Unit Officers (APO1)  told the Presidential Election Petitions Tribunal on Tuesday that the code was given in their very last briefing before deployment to the field. However, during cross examination by defender lawyers, the INEC officials admitted that they were trained with the INEC manual for technicians before being issued with the codes on their last briefing.

It cannot be disclosed even to the honourable court,” Umeh said. “We were trained generally and a day to the election they appointed APO1 and APO and handed over the codes to us,” he added. The agents said they were trained for three days by INEC and given a code by the Registration Area Technician (RATECH) to transmit the results at the end of voting in their units. While being cross examined by Buhari’s counsel, Abubakar Mahmud (SAN), Ogunsanya said he did the transmission of the results by himself using the smart card reader under the supervision of the presiding officer.
