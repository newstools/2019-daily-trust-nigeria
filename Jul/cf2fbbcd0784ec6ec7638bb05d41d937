The General Officer Commanding 7 Division of the Nigerian Army, Major-General Bulama Biu, has asked Boko Haram insurgents to give peace a chance. Speaking Saturday at the Command Guest House in Maiduguri, Borno State, at a grand reception in his honour over his accelerated promotion, he said: “I call on Boko Haram members to give peace a chance and lay down their arms and come back home so that they can be reintegrated back to the society as there are many opportunities for them. They can aspire to become what they want to become. They can even aspire to become president of this country. “We are not going to be detracted by the activities of Boko Haram terrorist and their collaborators. “This war is a must-win the war, there is no development without peace as Borno deserves peace, northeast deserves peace and Nigeria at large deserves peace.” Borno State Governor Babagana Umara, represented by his deputy, Usman Kadafur, said the state remained indebted to the military for bringing peace back to the state “and our heart will continue to be with those that paid the supreme price to ensure that peace comes back to our land.”  Boko Haram: Separating facts from fantasies My fear for Borno State (1) Intrigues over Obasanjo’s Boko Haram peace deal Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
