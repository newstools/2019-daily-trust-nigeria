Chairman of the African Business Aviation Association (AfBAA), Mr. Nick Fadugba, has outlined a vision 2030 for Nigerian aviation development, saying in the next 10 years, the country should have had two strong airlines “operating regular scheduled services on intercontinental, regional and domestic routes.” “By 2030, the Federal Government of Nigeria will have adopted the business models of Singapore and Dubai, UAE, by seriously embracing aviation as a strategic tool for economic and social development,” he said. Fadugba who is an advisor to the Association of African Aviation Training Organisations (AATO) also said the Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) should have, by 2030, resolved the receiverships of Arik Air and Aero Contractors, saying both airlines cannot be “in limbo”  for too long. He stated this in his presentation at the 23rd conference of the League of Airports and Aviation Correspondents on “Boosting Aviation Investments through Policy.” According to him, it is high time government sat down with the shareholders of both Arik and Aero to address the issue. Both Arik Air and Aero Contractors were taken over by the Federal Government through AMCON three years ago and they are still under receivership.
