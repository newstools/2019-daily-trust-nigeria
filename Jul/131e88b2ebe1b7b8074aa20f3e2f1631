One of Nigeria’s automobile giants, Coscharis, has signed a multi-million dollar partnership with French carmaker, Groupe Renault to assemble Renault vehicles at its assembly plant in Lagos. With the official announcement of the partnership, Coscharis would offer four variants of the Renault brand into the Nigerian market in the first instance, President/Chief Executive Officer of Coscharis Group, Dr. Cosmas Maduka said. Two of the variants, Logan and Duster, will be assembled locally here in this plant in SKD (Semi – Knocked Down). According to him, both the Renault Kwid and Renault Oroch will be added to the Renault line in no distant time. He said, “However, we will not rest on our oars as we are sure to wax stronger into the future with the introduction of other great Renault variants into the assembly line. “It is in an effort to achieve this that we have committed huge financial, technical and human resources to this partnership. Therefore the fact that we have ventured into it headlong underpins the level of confidence and hope we have for the future of the Nigerian automotive industry.” Maduka however decried a situation where some government agencies are still purchasing used vehicles that are out of the market. He described the situation as “embarrassing”, stressing the need for the Federal Government to support auto companies through patronage and provision of enabling environment for them to flourish.
