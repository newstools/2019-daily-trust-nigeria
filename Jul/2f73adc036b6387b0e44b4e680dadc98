A leading Nigerian e-commerce firm, Jumia Nigeria, has donated home care products and reading materials to the Nigerian Red Cross Orphanage Home located at Makoko, in Yaba area of Lagos state. The company, our reporter learnt, also donated over 300 protective wear and safety items to the Lagos State Traffic Management Agency (LASTMA). The volunteers were trained by the traffic agency at the Jumia warehouse in Ikeja, a day before they were dispatched to the field. Speaking during the visit to the orphanage, Jumia Nigeria’s Human Resources Lead, Mr. Dele Awolala, said the donations provided an opportunity for the company’s staff to interact with the children and appreciate the good work that the social workers and staff of Red Cross are doing in caring for them.
