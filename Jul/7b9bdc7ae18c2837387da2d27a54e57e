The president, Nigeria Consumer Protection Network (NCPN), Mr Kunle Kola Olubiyo, has said unless operators in the power sector are directly involved, the 11,000 megawatts (MW) target for 2021 announced by President Muhammadu Buhari may not be feasible. Daily Trust reports that President Buhari, on Monday, unveiled a new power target after the signing of electricity road map agreement between the Federal Government and German-based, Siemens. The director general of the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), Dr. Alex Okoh and the chief executive officer of Siemens, Mr. Joe Kaeser, signed the pact. Buhari said the targets would be to achieve 7,000MW in 2021, 11,000MW in 2023 and 25,000MW afterwards. Reacting to this, Mr Olubiyo told Daily Trust that whatever the Federal Government is doing in form of Siemens-BPE agreement is expected to be subjected to a sector-wide engagement. “It should have a sector-wide buy in and sector-wide participatory research, and inputs. We appreciate the good intentions of the Federal Government of Nigeria in engaging Siemens as a consultant to review the Nigerian Electric Power Road Map Phase. “My advice to BPE and handler of the power sector reforms in the Presidency is to always deepen the discussion and engagement of critical stakeholders. The Siemens agreement, to us as electricity consumers though well intended, was flawed with missed steps,” he said. Olubiyo said except the Generation Companies (GenCos) and the Distribution Companies (DisCos), which are in private hands are engaged, such progress will not be feasible as government directly controls only the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN). “BPE should learn to carry everybody along,” he added. Daily Trust reports that TCN, which currently has 8,100MW wheeling capacity, targets 10,000MW capacity this year, and 20,000MW by 2021 which is far higher than the 7,000MW Buhari stated. The GenCos now have 7,600MW generation capacity and over 13,000MW available capacity. The DisCos have recorded 5,300MW capacity but said they could take about 6,000MW. The French Development Agency (AFD) and TCN jointly argue that DisCos require about $4.3 billion to raise distribution networks that could deliver over 10,000MW to Nigerian homes and industries. Mr Olubiyo also noted that practical financial investments must be made rather than signing of pact alone. The managing director of TCN, Mr Usman Gur Mohammed, had severally called for the recapitalisation of the DisCos by allowing more investors to join the team and provide the $4.3bn needed investments. Pockets of failed power target Nigeria has recorded several failed targets and timelines. The Federal Government had given assurance of pegging electricity capacity at 6,500 megawatts (MW) by December 2014 but failed as Nigerians began year 2015 with 3,900MW. It had targeted 10,000MW earlier. In 2016, the Multi Year Tariff Order (MYTO) 2015 pegged multiple projections for electricity generation from which tariffs payable by all consumers at present were based. It pegged 5,500MW for 2016, 7,000MW for 2017 and at least 10,000MW by 2024 but as at 2019, the highest peak generation only attained 5,375MW in February. Experts had said the low generation on which the tariff was based contributed to the rise in the cost of energy bills.
