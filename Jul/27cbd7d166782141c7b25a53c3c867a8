The Head of Department, Fiqh and Usul Fiqh, International Islamic University, Malaysia, Prof Luqman Zakariya, has identified three essential benefits of Halal industries and certification that should be explored by Muslims. Prof Zakariya, who was the guest speaker at a one-day seminar organized by International Institute of Islamic Banking and Finance (IIIBF), Bayero University Kano (BUK), in collaboration with Halal Compliance and Food Safety, said there are spiritual, economic as well as health and social well-being benefits in halal products compliance. “If Nigerian Muslims can promote halal industries and certification, it will create three dimensions: first the spiritual aspect, the second aspect is the economic benefit then lastly the health and social well-being of the people,” he said The Director of the institute, Prof Binta Tijjani Jibril, in her address said, “This is a multi-trillion-dollar economic activity and our people are missing out on it. Due to lack of halal certification in this part of the country, we are unable to export our product, we are unable to develop the right kind of standards that will make our products attractive in Europe and even in the Muslim countries of Asia.” Vice Chancellor, BUK, Professor Muhammad Yahuza Bello, represented by Prof Salisu Shehu, said the most important aspect of the seminar was to remind Muslims about their spiritual obligation of ensuring what they consume for their daily lives are halal compliant.
