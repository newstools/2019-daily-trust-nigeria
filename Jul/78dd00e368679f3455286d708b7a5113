The Edo State House of Assembly has rejected the recommendation of the ad hoc committee of the House of Representatives for fresh inauguration, saying the directive to the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and Department of State Services (DSS) to seal up the assembly was uncalled for. This was contained in a statement signed by the Speaker, Frank Okiye and made available to journalists, yesterday, in Benin. Okiye said the recommendation of the committee did not come to them as a surprise with the information available to them. “For example, the chartered plane marked 5N FCT, which brought the committee members to Benin City was paid for by the National Chairman of the APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, who is a major party in the disagreement,” he alleged. He said the recent leaked audio conversation of the younger brother of the APC chairman, Seid Oshiomhole, revealed the underhand dealings in Abuja regarding the matter, claiming that Oshiomhole and his proxies had been having meetings with the committee members and other actors in Abuja to ensure that the issue goes in their favour. “We want to draw the attention of the general public and the police to a subsisting court order restraining the police headed by Mohammed Adamu; the National Working Committee of the APC; the DSS and their agents from interfering in the affairs of the assembly, as the House has been going about its activities peacefully and without rancour,” he said.
