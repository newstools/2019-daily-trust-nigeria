The Advocates for Integrity in Leadership (AFIL) has called for integrity in the hallowed chambers of the National Assembly. A press statement read at the #IamDifferent Walk to the National Assembly, yesterday, by one of the group’s conveners, Chimdi Neliaku, said young Nigerians had witnessed many fights on the floor of the National Assembly, seen legislators climbing fences and several other worrisome occurrences which brought low, the integrity of the legislature. “As part of our own contribution to nation building and development, this coalition of young Nigerians is heralding a national value re-orientation movement titled, ‘I Am Different’.

She said they started the advocacy on national value reorientation from the legislative arm of government because it was the torchbearer of Nigeria’s democracy and the bastion of civil rule. “This purposeful intervention will however not be limited to the legislature. We shall take it to the judiciary, the executive and the people,” she said. ''We wanted world class actors for Oloibiri'''' Who wants to ‘kill’ the ‘Not Too Young to Run’ bill?
