Abubakar had told State House journalists after a meeting of security chiefs with President Buhari last week that “the strategy that we’ve on ground is really working and that s the one we’ll continue to pursue.” But Conflict Advisor, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre, Salaudeen Hashim, said the service chiefs’ ideas on counterinsurgency are stale.

It’s a clear demonstration that, that’s why we’ve setbacks and they’ve no clear solutions.” The chairman of the Abuja chapter of ASIS, Kabir Adamu, said there should be a new security strategy whereby internal security challenges would be taken over by the police, civil defence and other internal intelligence and security agencies. Also reacting, Barrister Mike Ejiofor, said the results on the ground did not show that the current strategy was enough.
