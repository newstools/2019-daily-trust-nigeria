Oxfam in Nigeria has urged the Federal Government to fast-track action on the newly approved National Tax Policy as part of measures to tackle corporate crimes. The Oxfam in Nigeria Country Director, Mr. Constant Tchona, made the call, yesterday, in Abuja at the public unveiling of the Fair Tax Index report and the Commitment to Reducing Inequality Index (CRII) report. The event had as  theme “West Africa Inequality Crisis: The Fight Against Inequality through Progressive Taxation”. According to him, Oxfam has developed policy recommendations and influencing strategies, saying it would be used to advocate for a fairer tax system that helps to redistribute prosperity from the richest in the society to the  poorest. He said  a 2015 Oxfam’s report highlighted the inefficiency of Nigeria’s tax incentives where it submitted that the country lost N580bn annually through tax incentives to multinational corporations. While saying that the health budget was only one-third of this amount in 2015, Tchona noted that Nigeria needs to rework its strategies and set its economic priorities right by investing in agriculture, manufacturing and infrastructure rather than waste its hard-earned resources on unproductive and redundant tax incentives.
