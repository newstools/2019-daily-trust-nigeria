Delta State Election Petitions Tribunal presided over by Justice A. M. Abubakar has adjourned judgment to a later date on the petition filed by Evelyn Oboro of the PDP challenging the election of Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege of the APC. Oboro’s counsel, Prof. Wahab Egbewole (SAN), told the tribunal that as of the time of the election, Omo-Agege was not qualified to contest by virtue of the fact that the APC in Delta State was factionalised and had internal crisis. Prof Egbewole (SAN) said the election was fraught with irregularities and that Oboro should be declared the winner of the election, having the highest number of valid votes cast.
