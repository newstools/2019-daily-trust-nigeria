Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, yesterday, appealed to chieftains of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state to allow him appoint commissioners he can work with. Also, he intimated that he will appoint only technocrats and experts in various fields into his cabinet to help him deliver the dividends of democracy to the electorate during his second mandate. Ortom made the appeal when he addressed PDP faithful at an expanded caucus meeting of the party at the government house in Makurdi.

He called on Benue people to hold him responsible for the performances of his would-be cabinet members when eventually they come on board, noting that he would sack any of them who failed to meet expectations. He added that there were no longer any godfathers, so he would not allow anyone to mess him up. He disclosed further that he would work with 15 commissioners; five from each of the three senatorial zones; 23 special advisers; one from each local government; and three senior special assistants from each local government including one woman and one youth. “This tenure, we want to deliver on campaign promises. I do not want too much talk but action,” the governor said. Allow me appoint my commissioners, Ortom tells PDP chieftains Can Oshiomhole’s overtures keep Ortom in APC?
