The Nigerian Union of Mines Workers (NUMW) has tasked the National Assembly to ensure that its committees execute effective oversight functions that will pave way for the growth and development of the country. The National President of the Union, Comrade Hamza Mohammed, made the call while congratulating the President of the 9th Senate, Senator Ahmed Lawan and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila and their Principal Officers on their emergence as leaders of the 9th National Assembly. While noting that laws must be enacted to improve the condition of mines and quarry workers in the country, he said the government needs to engage the owners of big mining establishments with labour laws that will be favourable to workers in the country. Hamza tasked the Buhari administration to exercise the political will needed to kick start production works at Ajaokuta Steel Company (ASCO) and the National Iron Ore Mining Company, Itakpe, stating that “Nigerians can no longer afford the huge losses and capital flights caused by importation of steel product at the expense of under-developing the Nigerian steel sector.” “As a strong union of mines workers affiliated to the Nigeria Labour Congress, we are interested in the formulation of policies that will create more jobs for more Nigerians,” he said.
