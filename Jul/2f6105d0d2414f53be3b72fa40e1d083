A financial technological company, Riby, has said it will help trade groups and cooperatives across the country digitize their operations and get access to loans. The firm, through its 1.5M campaign, also said it would provide support for cooperatives, communities and trade groups, enabling them save money, and get interest over time. Salami Abolore, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Riby said: “We are focused on working with a segment of the market that has been neglected for a long time yet has immense potential. Our aim remains to enhance our users’ ability to generate liveable income, support them in securing a lifetime savings system and help them in the future secure a home.  We consider these three things as the foundation of Financial Stability.” He said cooperatives are an important tool that Nigeria must put special focus us on if we are to reduce the levels of poverty in our country.
