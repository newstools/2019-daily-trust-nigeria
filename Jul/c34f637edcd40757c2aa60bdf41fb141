Experts have told Daily Trust that only two possible policy decisions are open to members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) when they meet today and tomorrow: they can vote to either maintain policy rates at the current levels or reduce them. The head of research at FSDH Merchant Bank, Ayodele Akinwunmi said: “An increase in policy rates is not an option under the current economic situation in the country.’’ He argued that a cut would add weight to the implementation of the CBN’s 5-year strategic plan. FSDH Research anticipates a 50 basis points reduction in the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR), as well as a possible adjustment to the asymmetric rates around the MPR. During its last meeting on 20-21 May 2019, the MPC decided to hold the MPR at 13.50%, and retained the asymmetric corridor of +200/-500 basis points around the MPR. Analysts at Afrinvest also explained that, since the last meeting in May 2019, the global and domestic economic environment have become more supportive of the shift towards looser monetary policy. They noted that two key data points indicate sustained weakness in Nigeria’s external position. The current account deteriorated to-1.0% of GDP in Q1:2019 from 1.0% in Q4:2018 due mainly to a weakened trade surplus as imports expanded faster than exports, reduction in remittances and sustained weakness in the income and services account.
