The Speaker of the Kwara State House of Assembly, Yakubu D. Salihu, has called for youth inclusion in the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government. Rt. Hon. Yakubu made the call while receiving a delegation of YIAGA Africa, a Civil Society Organisation (CSO) that champions the #NotTooYoungToRun advocacy. The speaker, who commended Gov. AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of Kwara State for his passion for the youths, said, “Our Governor is a staunch supporter and believer in the young people. “He has always said that young people would occupy a significant per cent of his cabinet. This is because the governor recognises and appreciates the significance of the youths in the revolution in Kwara State.” He, however, observed with dismay the alleged exclusion of youths in the 43 ministerial nominees sent to the Senate. Therefore, he said, “With no youths among the ministerial nominees, invariably the minister of youths won’t be a youth. We must let the president know that we also have young people capable of being ministers. We have to do more to get this message to Mr. President.” Youths protest exclusion from ministerial list Discordant tunes over ministerial nominees Saraki inaugurates scheme to provide 40,000 jobs Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
