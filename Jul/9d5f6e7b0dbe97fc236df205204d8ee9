In fact, she promised me that she would be among those that would buy the wedding items for the bride,” he said. But Ibrahim Fayan-fayan added; “Last night after I returned home, I bought some meat for them. I met her boiling the water, but I had no idea what she was going to use it for,” He said he was relaxing after listening to a Hausa radio programme, ‘Taskar Labarai’ when she suddenly brought the hot water and poured it on his body, around his private part. Ibrahim, who is currently receiving treatment at the Danbatta General Hospital, said he had 10 children with his wife, adding that her whereabouts were now unknown as he was rushed to the hospital by his neighbor.
