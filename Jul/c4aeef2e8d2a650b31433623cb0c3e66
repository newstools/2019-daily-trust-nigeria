A PDP support group, The Bayelsa Integrity Group, has warned the aides and allies of Governor Seriake Dickson against continued attack on former President Goodluck Jonathan and sowing seed of discord in the party ahead of the November 16 governorship election in the state. The spokesman of the group, Mr Ebi Dressman, in a statement in Yenagoa, yesterday, said such tactics deployed by the governor’s supporters might jeopardize the chances of the party in a state where opposition parties were waxing stronger on a daily basis. He said: “They have been sowing the seeds of discord among the party leadership in the state through malicious press statements that purveyed fictitious falsehoods against the person of former President Goodluck Jonathan. “Former President Jonathan, since he left office, has dedicated himself to serve humanity and promote peaceful coexistence among peoples as a panacea for development. “His interests as a Nigerian have become subservient to his role as an elder statesman, hence his political engagements have been limited to pushing for the PDP, on whose platform he was given the opportunity to serve Nigerians, to be successful and continue to grow in strength and unity for democracy to thrive in Nigeria,” the group said.
