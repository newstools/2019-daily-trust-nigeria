A panel constituted by the Board of Trustees (BoT) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to probe why the party’s members in the National Assembly flaunted its directives on the election of principal officers in both chambers has commenced work in Abuja. The committee headed by former Senate President, Iorchia Ayu on Thursday met with Honourables Elumelu, Wole Oke, Linda Ikpeazu and four others who were suspended for three months by the PDP for allegedly playing roles that led to the flaunting of PDP’s directives. Before their closed-door meeting with the suspended lawmakers, Senator Ayu said the PDP would not take a decision capable of factionalising its ranks.

We are planning reconciliation and I can assure you that any decision reached will ensure peace. We will not factionalise the party,” he said. Former Senate Presidents, David Mark, Adolphus Wabara, former Deputy Senate President, Ibrahim Mantu and Hon. Austin Okpara are part of the committee.
