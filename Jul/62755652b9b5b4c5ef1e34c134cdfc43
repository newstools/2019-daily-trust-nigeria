Justice Nicholas Oweibo, sitting at a Federal High Court in Lagos, on  Wednesday remanded a self-acclaimed pentecostal pastor, Ugwochukwu Godwin Chinedu, in prison custody pending when his bail application for alleged drug trafficking will be heard and determined. The court remanded Chinedu in prison custody till October 3, 2019 following his arraignment on a one-count charge of unlawful exportation of 1.640 kilogrammes of methamphetamine, a psychotropic substance listed under international control. The defendant was alleged to have, therefore, committed an offence contrary to and punishable under Section 11(b) of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) Act Cap 30, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004. Chinedu pleaded not guilty to the one-count charge against him and the NDLEA prosecutor, Mr Abu Ibrahim, urged the court to remand him in prison custody and give him a trial date. The defendant’s counsel, Tony Nnamoko, informed the court that he had just been briefed about the matter and pleaded with the court to grant him a short adjournment to enable him complete the process of filing a bail application for his client. Following the submissions of both parties, the trial judge directed that Chinedu be remanded in prison custody and consequently adjourned the matter till October 3, 2019 for the hearing of the bail application of the defendant.
