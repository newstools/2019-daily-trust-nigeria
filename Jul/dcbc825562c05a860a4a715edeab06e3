The Sokoto State chapter of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) has dismissed its chairman, Abubakar Muhammad Sadiq, over alleged cheating and abandonment. Sadiq was also the governorship candidate of the party during the last election. A statement signed by 21 of the 23 local government chairmen of the party alleged that Sadiq absconded from the state without paying those employed as agents of the party during the last general elections.

Responding to the allegations, Sadiq stated that those behind the move were not SDP members, saying they were dismissed long ago. “In fact, we even filed a case against them in the court of law for impersonation and public deception,” he added.
