A constitutional lawyer and renowned human rights activist, Mr. Femi Falana, has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to tender an unreserved apology to Nigerians over his claim that the late military dictator, General Sani Abacha did not steal monies belonging to the Nigerian state. He also asked for an immediate and comprehensive probe of the disappearance of the $12.2bn under the former Military President Ibrahim Babangida military junta, as well as the investigation of the $16bn allegedly purportedly spent on generating electricity in the country, mostly under former President Olusegun Obasanjo, as promised by President Buhari. Falana made the calls on Wednesday in Abuja at a one-day international conference on “Agenda Setting for Citizens’ Interaction with Stolen Assets Recovery: Abacha Loot Recovery and Utilization as Case study,” organized by the Human Environmental Development Agenda (HEDA), in collaboration with ActionAid and Centre for Communication and Social Impact.
