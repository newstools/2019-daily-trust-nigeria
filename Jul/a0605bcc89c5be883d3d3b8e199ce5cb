A group of civil servants under the aegis of Concerned Kogi Workers Forum, has thrown their weight behind the governorship aspiration of a former Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Jibrin Usman (rtd), who is contesting in the November election on the platform of APC. Spokesman of the group, Hassan Abdul, in a statement issued yesterday in Lokoja, said their decision was based on the antecedents of Usman and the confidence they have that his reign will salvage workers from the current hardships they are facing under the Yahaya Bello-led government. The group appealed to the national leadership of the APC not give its ticket to Bello in view of his alleged “misrule and poor performance over the past three years.” He said the forum was made up of workers who were “arbitrarily sacked by the current administration and those who were cleared by screening committee but are yet to collect salary over the last 30 months.” He said there was need to ensure the emergence of a governor that will be “people-centred” in the forthcoming election.
