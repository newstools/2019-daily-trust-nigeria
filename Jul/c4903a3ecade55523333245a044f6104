He pointed out that the Federal Government had been giving series of excuses over the years concerning the issue of farmers/herders clashes, ranging from grazing route, dissatisfaction and others, adding that the Federal Government should have found solutions to the problem if there was sincerity of purpose. “Nigeria is not only the country rearing cattle, the people at the Federal level should find a way of tackling insecurity instead of the proposed Ruga settlement across the nation.” CAN: FG's Ruga settlement not relevant to Benue people No land for Ruga settlement in Edo — Obaseki Osinbajo’s office not supervising ‘Ruga’ settlements’ –Aide Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
