Analyst at Afrinvest said: “Our bearish outlook on the market remains unchanged, as we believe today’s bullish run is only temporary.” Commenting on the listing, Mr Oscar N. Onyema, Chief Executive Officer, NSE, said: “Listing on the Exchange reaffirms Airtel Africa’s long-term commitment to expanding opportunities and providing everyday services to Africans and Nigerians in particular. It also indicates the firm’s belief that our platform, which has a total market capitalization of N25.20Tn across various asset classes, remains a veritable avenue for raising capital and enabling sustainable national growth.  This listing serves to deepen the telecoms and technology sector for investors and provides an opportunity for a wider group of Nigerians to be part of the African telecoms growth story. “Today’s listing is a promising development in Africa with Airtel Africa being the second company to have its ordinary shares listed on both the London Stock Exchange and The Nigerian Stock Exchange.  This gives credence to the successful partnership between the two exchanges. I encourage similar situated companies to explore the different opportunities for raising capital on the Exchange’s platform.” JUST IN: Airtel Africa Plc to now list on Tuesday FBNQuest acts as financial adviser in Notore listing Notore lists N100bn shares at stock market Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
