There was pandemonium at the Ondo State House of Assembly complex yesterday as lawmakers were sent scurrying out of their seats when snakes fell from the roof of the House. The snakes were said to have suddenly appeared during plenary at the centre of the Speaker’s seat, forcing the lawmakers to scamper to safety. Proceedings were, of course, also disrupted. Efforts by the lawmakers to kill the snakes proved abortive as the reptiles escaped. A witness of the drama, who is a staffer of the Assembly, said that due to the deplorable condition of facilities at the complex, snakes freely enter lawmakers’ offices and the hallow chamber itself. The staffer said that much earlier on Wednesday afternoon, a mysterious snake in one of the offices had caused apprehension at the Assembly complex when it pursued a lawmaker out of his office. “And today, three snakes fell from the chamber’s roof when the sitting was about to commence, and this made all the lawmakers run for their lives. One of the snakes dropped in front of the Speaker and escaped from the scene. The lawmakers were shaking with fear”, the witness said. As a result of the snakes’ invasion, legislative activities have been suspended in the Assembly until the complex is renovated.
