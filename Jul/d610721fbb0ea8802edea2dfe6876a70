The resources that should have delivered the good life to majority of the people have been cornered and stolen by ravenous elites, leaving our roads, hospital and other social amenities in an appalling state”. Bello said the level of corruption is incredible, destructive and unacceptable, assuring that the commission’s chairman is working assiduously to ensure that money stolen from the country is returned. While noting that EFCC cannot win the fight against corruption alone, he called for the cooperation and support of stakeholders as well as the active participation of Nigerians in the fight.
