Unlike in the Senate, Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila, yesterday, failed to name eight principal officers of the 9th House of Representatives “because of the need for further and wider consultations across parties.” Bamidele Salam (PDP, Osun), who disclosed this to newsmen in Abuja shortly after Tuesday’s plenary, said the delay was to make sure that the principal officers, when announced, “would be in line with the ‎House Standing Rules.” The lawmaker, who spoke on behalf of the House ad hoc Committee on Media and Public Affairs, however, assured that the names are already with the Speaker and would be announced latest Thursday. Daily Trust reports that the positions of House Leader, Deputy House Leader, Chief Whip, Deputy Chief Whip, Minority Leader, Deputy Minority Leader, Minority Whip, and Deputy Minority Whip are yet to be officially announced by the Speaker as required by extant laws. Meanwhile, feelers emerged last week that some names have been penciled down for the various positions amid agitations by some members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).
