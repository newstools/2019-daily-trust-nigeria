A 39-year-old suspected homosexual, Justin Edward, who the police said had a habit of wearing a mask to avoid being identified, has been arrested in Atan, Ogun State. Edward’s style, according to the police, was to pick up his potential victim in his car under the guise of offering the person a lift, but would take him to an obscure destination where he would force him into anal sex under threat. The police said whenever the suspect was moving in any area where he feared he could be identified, he would wear a mask. Daily Trust learnt that his arrest followed series of complaints on the suspect’s activities received from some people who plied the Owode-Atan road on regular basis. The Assistant Inspector-General of Police (AIG) in charge of Zone 2 Command, comprising Lagos and Ogun states, Shehu Lawal, who confirmed the incident, said that the suspect had been on the close watch of the police. Lawal said that he detailed a crack team of detectives after the suspect on receiving many complaints against him from members of the public, particularly those who reside in the Atan area of Ogun State, about his activities. He said the discreet investigation paid off when the team stormed Edward’s hideout on July 20, 2019 at about 1.31am and effected his arrest. “When he was searched, three facial masks were found in his possession,” the AIG said. Lawal added that Edward confessed, during interrogation, to have had sexual intercourse with five men.
