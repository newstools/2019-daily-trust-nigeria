A panel constituted by the Board of Trustees (BoT) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to probe why the party’s members in the National Assembly flouted its directive on the election of principal officers in both chambers has commenced work in Abuja. The committee, headed by former Senate president, Iorchia Ayu, yesterday, met with Reps Elumelu, Wole Oke, Linda Ikpeazu and four others who were suspended for three months by the PDP for allegedly playing roles that led to the flouting of the PDP directive. Before their closed-door meeting with the suspended lawmakers, Senator Ayu said PDP would not take a decision capable of factionalizing its ranks.

We are planning reconciliation and I can assure you that any decision reached will ensure peace. We will not factionalize the party,” he said. Former Senate presidents David Mark and Adolphus Wabara, former deputy Senate president, Ibrahim Mantu and Hon. Austin Okpara are part of the committee.
