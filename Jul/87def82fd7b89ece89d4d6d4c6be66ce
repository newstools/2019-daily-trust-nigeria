The  House of Representatives member for Abuja South Federal Constituency, Alhaji Hassan Usman Sokodabo, has promised to initiate an empowerment programme for his constituents. Sokodabo made the pledge when a forum of former Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) councillors in Kwali Area Council paid him a courtesy visit at his country home in Abaji, yesterday. He expressed delight with the former councillors for sparing time to pay him a visit and for advising him to empower his constituents. He said as a three-term councillor before he became chairman of Abaji Area Council, there was need for him to heed to their advice. He assured them that he would see how he would initiate an empowerment programme that would benefit the people of Abuja South constituency irrespective of ethnic, religious or party differences. The chairman of the forum, Mohammed S. Mamman, who led other members of the group to Abaji, had earlier said the empowerment programme for people of the constituency would address unemployment, especially among women and the youth. He said instead of giving out money to individuals, it was better if the reps member organised a skill acquisition and empowerment scheme to support the less-privileged and vulnerable ones in the constituency. The forum chairman also appealed to Sokodabo to intervene over non-payment of the balance of the 50 percent severance allowance owed them by the area council authorities. Sokodabo assured them that he would contact the relevant authorities to look into their pending severance allowance issue.
