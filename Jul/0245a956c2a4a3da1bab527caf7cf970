The Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly has suspended the Chairman of Abak Local Government Area, Barr. Imoh Williams, for allegedly assaulting an artisan he owed N75,000. Gov. Udom Emmanuel had condemned the assault on Artisan Abraham by aides of the council chairman and directed the state assembly to conduct full investigation of the matter. A video circulating on social media shows aides of the suspended chairman beating a half-dressed man with belt and kicking him for daring to ask the chairman to pay up his N75,000 debt. Accordingly, the house, during an emergency plenary yesterday, mandated the vice chairman of the council, Mrs. Benita Ukpe, to take over the affairs of the council while investigation into the assault continues.
