A pressure group within the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), The Southeast APC Grassroots Mobilisers, has expressed concerns over the seeming exclusion of the South east region, especially Imo, from leadership positions in the 9th National Assembly. The group noted with disaffection, alleged plans by some leaders of the party at the national level to completely shut out the Imo State chapter of the party from taking any of the principal positions in either the House of Representatives or the Senate. In a statement jointly signed by the state coordinators of the group, Chimaraoke Uzoma (Abia), Benjamin Ekeanyanwu (Imo), Ohaeri Placid (Ebonyi), Oguh Chijioke (Anambra), and Ekwueme Anthony (Enugu), it said: “It has reasons to believe, most regrettably, that there is a systematic conspiracy to extinct the APC from Imo State – the birthplace of the APC in the entire Southeast.” The statement added that: “It is important to remind our leaders that among the five states in the Southeast, only Imo State and Abia State have elected members of the National Assembly on our Party’s platform. It is only fair that, considering the enormous contributions of the Imo State chapter of the APC towards sustaining the Party in the Southeast, Imo should be considered for any leadership position of the 9th National Assembly zoned to the Southeast. This is both fair and politically correct.” Okorocha win puts Imo with central govt, says group Mark, Ekweremadu to lose senate positions Leadership tussle: Reps’ new battle of letter writing Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
