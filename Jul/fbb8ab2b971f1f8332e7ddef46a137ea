The PDP has criticised President Muhammadu Buhari for describing as “isolated cases,” what the party called “killings, bloodletting, violence and widespread kidnapping in various parts of the country.” The opposition party, in a statement, yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, described the comment as “unfortunate,” adding that it further “exposed the incompetence of the Presidency as well as its insensitivity.” It therefore called on Buhari to take decisive steps that would put an end to the killings and violence in the country. “The PDP notes that such underplay of serious security situation, particularly at this time that many communities and families in Nigeria are hurting and looking up to leaders for comfort and assurances, is a direct spat on the graves of the victims and assault on the sensibilities of compatriots,” the statement said.
