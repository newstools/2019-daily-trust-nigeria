According to him, teams of Operations Puff Adder and Sharan-Daji moved to the area and engaged the hoodlums in a gun duel. “In the process  the hoodlums shot the tires of the police Armoured Personnel Vehicle and injured one army and one civil defence officer.  At the time the combined ground forces were mobilized into the village, the hoodlums had already operated and escaped into the forest. “It is ostensibly clear that it was a reprisal attack carried out by the hoodlums against the community. Joint security forces have been deployed to the area to arrest the situation, pursue and arrest the fleeing hoodlums,” he said. He assured that government and security forces were working towards ending banditry in the state.
