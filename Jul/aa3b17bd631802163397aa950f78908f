The coalition of All Progressives Congress (APC) Stakeholders Forum in Taraba State has denied knowledge of the list sent to the national secretariat of the party for appointments. This was coming as President Muhammadu Bihari is said to be preparing to announce his new cabinet. The forum, while addressing newsmen in Jalingo at the weekend, said its members were excluded in most of the decisions of the party in the state. A national officer of the coalition, Rimamnde Nuhu, who spoke during the briefing said the leadership of the party needed to be modified at all levels to meet the expectations of members across the country. Nuhu said it was the desire of the forum to see all loyal and faithful members rewarded with political appointments. He said the forum was not pleased on how social programmes like the N-power and the school feeding system introduced by the Buhari administration were hijacked by the PDP government in Taraba State. Nuhu lamented that APC members who worked and suffered for the party did not benefit from the programmes. “We want this time to see our members benefiting from such programmes and also be rewarded with political appointments to encourage more loyalty and faithfulness to our party,” he said.
