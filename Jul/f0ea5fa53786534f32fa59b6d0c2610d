The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has tasked the federal government to introduce measures that will spur economic growth if Nigeria must benefits from the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) trade policy. Rising from its July 2019 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Meeting, the CBN said Nigeria must resuscitate moribund industries to boost exports. Reading the communiqué at the end of the meeting, the CBN Governor Mr. Emefiele said on AfCTA, the committee urged the FG to put in place measures to aid the economy in realising the benefits and full potentials of that Agreement. He said the Committee also noted “the positive developments towards the creation of a common currency in the West African Zone by January 2020 and commended Government and the Central Bank for pushing forward the initiative.” The Committee, however, enjoined the Bank to ensure that Nigeria is properly positioned to maximise the benefits of monetary integration. The committee also voted to hold all rates constant as the previous MPC meeting. “The Committee decided unanimously by a vote of all members present to retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 13.5 per cent and to hold all other policy parameters constant.” He said this is based on the “conviction of members that key macroeconomic indicators are trending in the right direction.” CBN continues tightening measures CBN to restrict banks’ access  to government securities CBN, MTN settle $8.1bn repatriation issue — Emefiele Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
