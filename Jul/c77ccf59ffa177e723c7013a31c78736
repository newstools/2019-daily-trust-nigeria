The Federal Ministry of Mines and Steel Development has partnered with the Gemological Institute of Nigeria (GIN) to design and implement a strategy for the development of jewellery and gemstone in Nigeria. The Project Coordinator, Mineral Sector Support For Economic Diversification (MinDiver), Mr Linus Adie, said the move is aimed at developing a sustainable master plan that will help in poverty alleviation, job and wealth creation through the development of a vibrant jewellery and gemstone industry in Nigeria. In a statement, he said part of the design will hinge on the expansion of the local market, skills acquisition and training of artisans; specifically to cater for the yearnings of the Nigerian market. Adie said in the long run, Nigeria is looking at developing a template like that of India, Sri Lanka and Germany where in a jewellery or gemstone workshop, there is a one-stop shop for designers, cutters and crafters to operate. He said jewellery production contributes hugely to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of these nations which makes it a path to follow for Nigeria.
