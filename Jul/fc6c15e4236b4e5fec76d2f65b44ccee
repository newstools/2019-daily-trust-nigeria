Immediate past Governor of Kogi State, Capt. Idris Wada, has officially declared interest to contest in the November 16, governorship election in the state. The former governor who made the declaration at the weekend while addressing state PDP executives in Lokoja, said his intention to seek for a comeback as governor was in response to the sufferings of the people.
