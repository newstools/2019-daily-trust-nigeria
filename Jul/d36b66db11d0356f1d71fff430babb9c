The Director General of the National Population Commission, Ghaji Ismaila Bello, has stressed the need for Nigeria to conduct a population census as it was last conducted in 2006. Bello made the submission at a press conference to mark the 2019 World Population Day in Abuja yesterday. “It is important that Nigeria undertakes a population census to ascertain its actual population as we are now working based on estimations.
