A housewife, Mode Akinosin, has pleaded with a customary court sitting in Odigbo, Odigbo local government, Ondo State, to dissolve her 15-year-old union with her husband, Akingun Ojomu, alleging he was always beating her. Akinosin also told the court that sometime ago when the family relocated to Lagos, her husband married another woman without notifying her. She said that the development resulted into a serious quarrel in the home and beatings against her. “After a while, we came back to Ore and the fights and beatings continued. Apart from beating me, he is in the habit of always destroying my property, won’t pay our three children’s school fees and is always defaming my character. I don’t love him anymore and I want an end to this marriage,” she pleaded. Ojomu was not in court to counter the petitioner’s claims. The court president, Mr B.E. Adenigbo, said the case had suffered several adjournments due to the absence of the respondent, who he said had been served with court notice. Adenigbo noted that Ojomu did not pay any dowry on Akinosin and “so the party can go on their own ways.” The court ordered the respondent to pay N5000 each for the feeding of the last two children, starting from August 30, 2019, while the two parents should take responsibility of the children’s education and welfare.  ‘I pay the house rent yet he beats me, disrespects my family’ Man tells court how wife grabs, twists his private part anytime they fight 4-yr-old marriage heads for the rocks Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
