Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, on Sunday, jetted out of Nigeria to attend this year’s Mutual Union of Tiv in America (MUTA) and the Annual Convention of Idoma Association taking place in Maryland and New York respectively in the United States. A statement by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, indicated that both events would hold between August 1 and 4, 2019. Akase also disclosed that the State’s Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Sir John Ngbede, the three Senators from the state, three House of Representatives members and three State Assembly members are expected to attend the two events. He however, told our correspondent by telephone that the state government was not funding the senators, adding that no amount was approved for the trip outside the usual official travel allowances of the governor and two of his aides on the journey. The governor’s spokesman stated that the conventions organised by Benue indigenes living in America seek to chart a new course for greater unity among people of the state and its development in all sectors of the economy. “Governor Ortom, who is to leave for the United States Sunday, July 28, will also take part in the Integrated Agriculture and Solid Waste Management forum at the University of Texas in Arlington,” the statement noted.
