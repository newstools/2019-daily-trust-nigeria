The Federal Government has announced that its monthly bond auction for the month of July, 2019, was over-subscribed by 207.6 per cent. In a statement, the Debt Management Office (DMO) said the total subscription received from bidders for the three bonds offered; including five, 10 and 30-year tenures, was in excess of N156bn against N145bn offered. DMO said it originally offered N145bn for three instruments and received a total value of N301.02bn, indicating a subscription level of 207.6 per cent. The statement also noted that the auction which took place on Wednesday received 298 competitive bids from investors for the three instruments of five, 10 and 30-year tenures that were offered. It, however, said that overall, N145.02bn was raised at the auction through both competitive and non-competitive bids. “The total amount allotted for competitive bids was N86.82bn from the total subscription of N301.02bn. In addition, the sum of N58.20bn was allotted across the three tenors for non-competitive bids at the same rates with the competitive bids.” DMO added that allotments were made on successful bids at 13.35 per cent for the five-year, 13.64 per cent for the 10-year and 14.12 per cent for the 30-year bonds. These, it said, were consistent with secondary market yields and also represented a decline in the marginal rates compared with those at the June bond auction. “The amount raised is to be utilised to part-finance the 2019 budget of the Federal Government,” DMO said.
