Wahidullah Mayar, spokesman for Afghan Health Ministry disclosed that another 33 were also wounded in the incident that took place close to an entrance gate of a university. The Kabul police spokesman, Ferdous Faramarz, said that the bomber was inside a car with explosives attached to him, but it’s unclear whether the car itself was loaded with further explosive materials. Two magnetic bombs were also defused from the area. Faramarz said while the identity of the majority of the victims has yet to be determined, a number of students of the university were entering the compound at the time of the explosion. The Taliban have denied responsibility for the incident.
