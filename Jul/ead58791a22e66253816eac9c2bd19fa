The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Zamfara State has warned against politicising the peace deal initiated by Governor Bello Muhammad Matawalle. The party’s committee on information chaired by Alhaji Hashimu Madomawa, said it would be a great disservice to the people of Zamfara State and Nigeria in general for someone to bring in politics into the peace process in the state. Madomawa, who doubles as PDP secretary in the state, said irrespective of which party someone belonged to, restoring peace to the state should be treated with utmost seriousness and attention. He said Governor Matawalle saw the peace pact in the state as a topmost priority, and therefore should be given all the necessary support and cooperation to succeed. “Markets have reopened and routes that were closed are now being plied by motorists and over 211 kidnapped victims were released by the armed bandits without paying a dime as ransom,” he said. “In the same vein, attacks have drastically reduced. Indeed, this is an extraordinary achievement within a short time,” he added. Alhaji Madomawa said a new chapter would soon be opened in Zamfara, adding that the citizens of the state were very much elated with the development.
