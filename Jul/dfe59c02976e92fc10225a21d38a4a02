A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo state, Charles Idahosa, has said that the party will die a natural death in the state if governor Godwin Obaseki is forced out of the party with the Assembly crisis rocking the state. While speaking with journalists in Benin on Monday on the raging crisis in the party, Idahosa said he and many other party members would leave with governor Obaseki if he is forced out of the party by the supposed godfather. “APC will die a natural death in Edo if Godwin Obaseki is allowed to leave the party due to the unabated crisis that is plaguing it in the state. The party will die here because the question we must ask ourselves is simple. Is he working? Is he doing well?
