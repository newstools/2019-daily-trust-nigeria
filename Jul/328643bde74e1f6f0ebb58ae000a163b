The chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the FCT, Alhaji Abdulmalik Usman, has said the party is not silent over the non-inclusion of an FCT native in the ministerial list by President Muhammadu Buhari. Usman, who spoke with our reporter on telephone in Abuja yesterday, said those who are saying the ruling party has been silent over the agitation were not being fair to the party. He said the ruling party must not go to the pages of newspaper to blow its trumpet before the people of the FCT would know it was pursuing a ministerial appointment, saying the party had even before the election, made a case for ministerial appointment. He added that there was a delegation of stakeholders and traditional rulers who visited the president to appeal to him on the need to give a ministerial slot to the people of the FCT. “I think those who are saying APC has been silent are being fair to the party. And by the way, those who are now agitating for ministerial slot, what did they doregarding the ministerial slot when they were in power in the last 16 years,” he asked. He alleged that the agitation for a ministerial appointment by some prominent politicians was PDP agenda to get cheap popularity from the people.
