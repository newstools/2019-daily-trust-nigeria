The president of a Mapo Grade A Customary Court in Ibadan, Mrs Imoleayo Akinrodoye, on Wednesday remanded a woman, Yetunde Dada, in Agodi prison for allegedly stabbing her neighbour, Adejoke Iginla, with a broken bottle. Akinrodoye ordered that Dada be remanded pending further investigation into the matter and adjourned the case till July 26, 2019 for further hearing. The police prosecutor, Sergeant Ayodele Ayeni, had informed the court that the defendant was facing a one-count charge of assault. Ayeni stated that Dada committed the crime on July 14, 2019 at 2.30pm at Idi-Arere, Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. He added that the defendant and Iginla had been engaged in a physical combat due to some misunderstanding between them. The prosecutor said that well-meaning elders in the neighbourhood intervened and settled the misunderstanding for the duo. Dada was said to have, however, remained unhappy and, after the mediators had left, she allegedly grabbed a bottle, broke it and stabbed Iginla in the neck. “Iginla was immediately rushed to a hospital but we are not sure of her survival yet,” Ayeni said.
