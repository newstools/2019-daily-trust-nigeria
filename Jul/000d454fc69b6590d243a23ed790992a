This was disclosed yesterday at a presentation of award of “Best Resident Electoral Commissioner in North East” to INEC’s Bauchi State Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Alhaji Ibrahim Abdullahi, by the Coalition of Nigeria Civil Society Organisations (CNCSO) at the INEC headquarters in Bauchi. In an opening remark, the Coordinator of the group, Abdullahi Adamu, said the Bauchi REC was found worthy of the award for his excellent qualities and handling of elections in Bauchi.
