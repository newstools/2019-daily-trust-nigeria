The Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal sitting in Birnin Kebbi has dismissed the petition filed by the PDP challenging the victory of the APC candidate, Governor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, in the recent election in the state. In her ruling, the tribunal’s Chairman, Justice Amina Adamu Aliyu, who led two other judges, affirmed that the petition by PDP lacked all necessary evidence to show that the election was marred by irregularities and malpractices as claimed by the party and its candidate, Sen. Isa Galaudu. Justice Amina Aliyu also submitted that the case was struck out because it lacked merit. In his reaction, Counsel to Gov. Bagudu and the APC, Yakubu Maikyau (SAN), said the pronouncement by the tribunal’s judges was in order in its entirety, saying they were pleased with the judgement. He said: “If they feel dissatisfied with the judgement, they could head to the appeal court, they would not be distracted, but we will follow them there accordingly.” He said to challenge the decisions of the tribunal at the appellate court was a fundamental right of anybody.
