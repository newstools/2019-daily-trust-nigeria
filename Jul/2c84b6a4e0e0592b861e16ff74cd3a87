The Kaduna State chapter of PDP says it has received information that election materials used for the conduct of the March 9 governorship election in the state may be tampered with. State Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Abraham Alberah Catoh, said in a statement that they received the information from credible sources and was raising the alarm for people to be vigilant. “Inasmuch as we do not want to question the integrity of INEC, we wish to state that the eyes and ears of our teeming party faithful/sympathisers are wide open in all INEC offices spread throughout the 23 local government areas of Kaduna State and the state INEC headquarters,” he said. “We advise INEC not to do anything that could tamper with the fragile peace reigning in the state, as any attempt to do the bidding of undemocratic external forces will be resisted by the public whose mandate was earlier stolen.” The PDP said while it would not want to say anything on its petition before the tribunal, “the eagle eyes are watching and keeping vigil on this undemocratic and crude attempt at coercing INEC officials into embarking on a dangerous mission,” he said.
