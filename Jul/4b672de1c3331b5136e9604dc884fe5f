A group, Arewa Youth Coalition (AYC), on Wednesday, faulted the ministerial list submitted to the Senate by President Mohammed Buhari for confirmation. Speaking in Kaduna, the National President of the group, ýComrade Muktar Mohammed, said President Buhari disappointed Nigerian youths because none of them appeared in the ministerial list. He said the names submitted by the president were known faces to Nigerians and that some were not even qualified for reappointment or be given the position of ministers. “All the names released are either former governors, ministers, deputy governors, or those that held political offices in past administrations,” he said. He said some were even facing corruption charges in court, but that the president decided to submit their names for confirmation. “Honestly, as a youth organisation, we are not happy with the list and we reject it because none of the nominees is under 40 years. They are same people we knew while growing up. The question is, when will the youths be given a chance to also rule or govern this country?” he asked. He also reminded the president of the promise he made to involve youths in his cabinet, saying the pledge had not seen the light of day.
