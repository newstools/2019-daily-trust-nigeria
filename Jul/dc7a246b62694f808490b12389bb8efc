He said the present administration would ensure that all the people living with disabilities were engaged into trading, skills acquisition and other forms of empowerment, adding that the council will also support those in school. “I am impressed that despite your condition, some of you were able to go to school and I want to assure all of you that the council will try its best to give necessary support to all of you,” the statement said. The chairman after meeting with the group directed for the immediate  payment of school fees for disabled students at various schools across the council, while urging them to continue to study hard so that they would contribute their quota to the development of the council. The chairman further urged parents, guardians and caregivers to join hands with his administration to ensure that children not only get the desired education but were also inculcated with good morals for the betterment of the society.
