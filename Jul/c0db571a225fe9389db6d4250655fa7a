Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has hailed the suspension of Ruga settlements plan by the Federal Government, describing the development as, “victory for all peace loving Nigerians.” Ortom, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, noted that the rejection of the Ruga settlement model was not personal but rather a struggle by the people of the country against impunity and injustice. He commended President Muhammadu Buhari for heeding the call of the people for the suspension of the Ruga settlement patterns, stressing that the decision to suspend the Ruga programme shows that Buhari had heard the voices of majority of Nigerians on the matter.
