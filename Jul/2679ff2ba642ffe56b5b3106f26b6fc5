Fifteen governorship candidates who featured in the March 9 polls in Ogun State, yesterday, appealed to Allied Peoples Movement (APM) candidate, Adekunle Akinlade to withdraw his petition against Governor Dapo Abiodun. They described the petition as “needless and a distraction to the governor,” who they said was facing the task of governance. Addressing newsmen in Abeokuta on behalf of the League of Registered Political Parties (LRPP) and the Governorship Candidates Forum, Otunba Adebayo Mosuro also asked a faction of Labour Party (LP) challenging the party’s exclusion from the ballot during the election, to withdraw its petition.

In a swift reaction, the Acting Publicity Secretary of APM, Olumide Balogun dismissed the position, saying the party and its candidate would pursue the petition to the logical end.
