Parents have been urged to invest time in their children as it was wrong to leave the nurturing of children to schools alone. Doveland International Schools, Abuja, made the call at its 2018/2019 graduation ceremony at the weekend in Abuja. The Executive Director of the school, Chief (Mrs.) Justina Chukwu, enjoined parents to be relentless in partnering with schools in the upbringing of their children as fellow stakeholders in the advancement of any society. Chukwu said that nothing can replace the training by parents where good family values are inculcated early in the child’s developmental stage. Similarly, the Special Guest Speaker at the event, Dr. Jumai Ahmadu, said schools can only offer corresponding value to children, to enable them achieve their goals in life. Ahmadu, who noted that she was performing a first major task after graduation as a doctorate degree holder, stressed the need for children to always study to surpass their parents. She urged children to aspire to acquire more knowledge and experience, by aiming for more with extra hardwork, in order to achieve more in life. “Learning gets more exciting as you go higher in life. you must take your academics very seriously, and will achieve your goals in life,” she stated.
