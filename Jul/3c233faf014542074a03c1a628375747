Nine persons who were arrested between Monday and Wednesday for allegedly driving against traffic have been sentenced to 20 hours of environmental sanitation duty for flouting the Lagos State traffic laws. In addition, the nine convicts will forfeit their vehicles to the Lagos State government as deterrence to other would-be law breakers. In her judgment yesterday, Magistrate (Mrs) Salau Omobola of the State Mobile Court noted that though it was the drivers who violated the traffic laws, the items they used in committing offence were the vehicles. In that regard, she ordered the outright forfeiture of the nine vehicles to the state government after the drivers pleaded guilty. Vehicles forfeited to the government included an Acura car, APP 39 EX; a Toyota Hilux KSF 374 DH; a small Nissan bus KJA 646 XT; a Peugeot APP 437 FN; an LT Volkswagen bus JJJ 822 XT; a Volkswagen T4 bus KTU 169 XJ; a Volkswagen KRD 438 XL and a Volkswagen bus EKY 946 FT. The nine vehicles were part of the more than 21 others impounded by operatives of the Lagos State Environmental Taskforce, led by its Chairman, Chief Superintendent of Police Olayinka Egbeyemi, at Cele and Iyana-Isolo bus-stops on the Oshodi-Mile 2 expressway. Egbeyemi said he had received numerous complaints from motorists and residents in those areas of the activities of drivers who were always driving against traffic and causing a gridlock. 2 die, 13 injured in Ogun road crashes Driving with tears in Lagos Bullion van driver docked for driving against traffic Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
