Abubakar said it was time to ensure fairness and justice for the marginalised people of Kogi west. He said, “In the spirit of fairness, equity and justice, we are calling on the national chairman as a matter of urgency and concerns to look and listen to the voice of the good people of Kogi State who are saying that governorship position remains in west and central senatorial districts of Kogi. “For the past 20 years, Kogi east has ruled for 16 years and Kogi central for four years. Fairness demands that Kogi west be given the opportunity unless there are no competent people there.” 2015: Need to rotate Kogi West senatorial seat 17 Osun APC gov''ship candidacy: Youths want indirect primaries Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
