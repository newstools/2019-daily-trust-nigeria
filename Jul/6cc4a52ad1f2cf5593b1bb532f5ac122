The people of Gadako community in Munya local government area of Niger state have been sensitised on the dangers of involving their children in mining activities instead of sending them to school. The one-day awareness campaign, which centered on the danger associated with child labour, was carried out by the Federal Ministry of Mining and Steel Development at the community primary school on Thursday. North Central Trust reports that artisan mining is the main preoccupation of the people of Gadako community with women and children as major drivers. The Desk Officer, Gender and Child Labour in the ministry, who represented the permanent secretary, urged parents to allow their children acquire education, which would aid them to add value to mining, instead forcing them to the field during school hours as has been the practice. She said as part of efforts to encourage the community to enroll their children in school, the ministry has renovated the existing three blocks of classrooms accompanied by a VIP toilet and borehole as well as furniture. The ministry also trained the community’s women groups and associations on safe mining, while also providing them with tools such as rubber boots, wheelbarrow, hand gloves,  head pans and shovels amongst others to safe guard them against any hazard during their mining activities. The village head of Gadako, Malam Adamu Galadima commended the ministry for the intervention, while promising that to make school enrollment compulsory for all parents in other to discourage child labour.
