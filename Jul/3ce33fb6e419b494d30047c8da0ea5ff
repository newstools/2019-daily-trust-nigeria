He said the incident happened on the 8th of April, 2019 at LADOL, adding that SIC Wuyah died at the spot while the Korean, who was rushed to the hospital, died two days after. “We set up a panel to investigate the incident and it has recommended his [Oshemi] dismissal and prosecution which we have already implemented,” the NSCDC boss said. According to him, Oshemi claimed he shot his colleague and the Korean because he was being owed by the NSCDC. The Commandant General however, debunked such claim. “There is no way the Corps would have owed him [Oshemi] because we are not responsible for salary payment. Personnel get their salaries through the IPPIS platform,” CG Mohammed said. He added that allowances were being paid directly to the security personnel by LADOL, stressing that Oshemi’s claim that he was being owed by the NSCDC was false. While assuring the public that the incident would not repeat itself, the CG disclosed that he had ordered a forensic and psychological profiling of all personnel to ascertain their state of mental health before deployment. “As soon as we conclude this exercise [forensic and psychological profiling of all personnel] which is ongoing, it will guide us in deploying personnel henceforth,” he said.
