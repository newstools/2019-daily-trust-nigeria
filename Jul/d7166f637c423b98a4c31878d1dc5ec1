Rivers State Governor Nyesom Ezenwo Wike yesterday described the emergence of the minority leader of the House of Representatives, Ndudi Elumelu, as the handiwork of those he called traders and merchants. Wike was speaking in his office when Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde visited him. He said: “I am not surprised.  When you have traders and merchants, what do you expect? It is unfortunate for those who do not understand what politics is all about.  I am a core party man. I believe in the party”.

He expressed confidence  in the ability  of the Oyo  State governor to move the state forward and entrench development. Earlier,  Makinde alleged that the position of the People’s Democratic Party was subverted at the House of Representatives. “We all saw what happened at the National Assembly yesterday, they are things that call for concern, if the party takes a position on certain things, we want to ensure that is carried through”, he said. He said he was in Rivers State to also discuss issues of true federalism and the role of states in the development process.
