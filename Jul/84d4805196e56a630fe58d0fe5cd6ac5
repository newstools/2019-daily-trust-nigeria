A gubernatorial aspirant in Kogi State on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Prince Mustapha Mona Audu, has declared confidence in beating the incumbent Governor, Yahaya Bello, by winning the governorship ticket in the upcoming primary of the party in the state. Prince Audu who was the second person to purchase the expression of interest form at the APC secretariat in Abuja, urged the party to adopt the primary that the stakeholders were calling for. “Whether the primary is direct or indirect, I’m not bothered by it.

Nonetheless, I do not feel threatened either; and I am sure that whichever one holds, I will win it. It is not a do or die affair,” Audu said.
