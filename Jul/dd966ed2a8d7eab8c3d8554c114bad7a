The Enugu State Police Command, on Saturday, debunked the video circulating in some section of the social media, claiming that there was a bomb explosion at Otigba Junction within the Enugu metropolis. A statement issued on Saturday by the state police spokesman, SP Ebere Amaraizu, said no such incident occurred anywhere in the entire Enugu State and advised people to go about their normal lawful businesses without fear of intimidation. He described the video in circulation on social media as “handwork of mischief makers who want to create fear and panic in the minds of innocent law abiding citizens,” stressing that people should ignore it.
