Governor Seriake Dickson’s political family, Restoration Caucus, has picked three members of the team to support for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship ticket in Bayelsa State. According to a statement by the governor’s Special Adviser on Political Matters, Mr Feynman Wilson, in Yenagoa yesterday, the arrangement is part of the process for the selection of the PDP candidate for the November 16 governorship election in the state. Wilson said the ‘Restoration Caucus’ of PDP took the decision at a meeting under the leadership of Governor Dickson after a successful conclusion of the three days fasting and prayer session organised by the state to seek the face of God on the critical issue of selecting the next gubernatorial candidate for the PDP.
