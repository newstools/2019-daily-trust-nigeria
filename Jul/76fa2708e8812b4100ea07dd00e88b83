He said he received reports from his agents that people could not come out to vote, as there were no INEC supervising officers at the units. He added that security agencies chased away his party agents from the polling units from where results were eventually brought to the local government collation centre. “We did not see INEC officials. Form EC8A entries were degraded during the entry to the ward and local government,” he said.
