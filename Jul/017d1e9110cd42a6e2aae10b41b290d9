An elder statesman and prominent Lagos community leader, Prince Tajudeen Olusi, has disagreed with former President Olusegun Obasanjo over the insecurity in the country. He said inasmuch as the former president is an elder statesman and opinion leader in his own right, his conclusion about insecurity in his new letter was faulty. Speaking with Daily Trust, Olusi who is chairman of APC Elders’ Forum in Lagos opined that the administration of President Buhari is doing its best to address the insecurity in the country. He called on Nigerians to support the Federal Government’s efforts by exposing those he accused of fuelling the insecurity because of their opposition to the present administration. “All these cries in respect of attacks, and insecurity are being organized by some people who are opposed to the present administration of our country,” he said. Olusi expressed confidence that despite the many predictions that Nigeria might disintegrate because of the series of attacks and killings, there was no cause for alarm.
