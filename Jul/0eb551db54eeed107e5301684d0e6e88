The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) Ahmed Lawan Kuru has said the Corporation is working with other sister agencies to produce a full length television documentary of notorious and recalcitrant obligors of AMCON. Kuru listed the agencies to include the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC), and the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC). The AMCON MD who was Guest Speaker at the just concluded July 2019 edition of the Breakfast Meeting organised by the Nigerian – American Chamber of Commerce (NACC) in Lagos said the idea was to document in a permanent format for generations yet unborn to know the so-called big men and women that are behind the over N5trillion debt burden, which AMCON is battling to recover. “Sadly, these are the calibre of people we respect in Nigeria but these people are not role models. How can you be a role model when you cannot honour a simple obligation? That is why I have been consistent in the call for the return of the failed bank act. The way we are handling the issue in the country suggest that we are encouraging a lot of financial rascality. People have to be held accountable for their actions, which I believe would serve as deterrent to others,” Kuru said in a statement.
