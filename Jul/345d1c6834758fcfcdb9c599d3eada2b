The Kaduna State Internal Revenue Service (KDIRS) has recovered N9.4 billion Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) and withholding tax liabilities from Federal Government agencies in the state. The Board Secretary and Legal Adviser of KDIRS, Francis Kozah, who disclosed this yesterday in a chat with newsmen in Kaduna, said KDIRS had conducted tax audits on Federal Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) in the state from 2007 to 2014, and revisited the issue, looked at the audit report vis-à-vis the provisions of the law and updated it, and that the exercise led to the establishment of liabilities on PAYE and withholding taxes on the MDAs to the tune of N13.9bn. Kozah said the recovery took a very long time to come to fruition because the MDAs were not willing to pay the arrears, particularly the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria and the Kaduna State Polytechnic, Kaduna.
