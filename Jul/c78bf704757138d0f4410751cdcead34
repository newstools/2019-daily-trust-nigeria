Access Bank Plc is partnering with the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) to attract large corporate firms looking to setting up offshore holding companies or special purpose vehicles abroad. The bank disclosed this at a session with business owners in Lagos last weekend. DIFC is one of the world’s top financial centres and the leading financial hub for the Middle East, Africa and South Asian region. Rosevelt Ogbonna, the Deputy Managing Director of the bank said: “It provides opportunity for large corporates looking for jurisdiction that is safe without the stigma of Panama. “What the DIFC provides is another alternative and it is one that has been there for 15 years on and they have demonstrated that they are world class and can compete with the best economic zones anywhere in the world,” he stated. He said one of the things about financial services is that customers want alternatives, adding that “Access Bank is glad to be partnering with DIFC in the last four years and it has been excellent. We are sharing this so that others can take the benefit.” Vikrant Bhansali, the Chief Representative, International Market of DIFC, said it offers 0% tax rate on profit, personal income tax, 100% foreign ownership, no restriction on foreign controls and no currency restriction. “The capital requirement for non-regulated business is waved and for the regulated side, there is a risk-based analysis of what should be required,” he added.
