A pressure group, Development and Political Research has reiterated the need for leaders of all tiers of government  to continue to  bring to justice dishonest politicians and public officers. In a statement jointly signed by the Chairman, Abubakar Umar and Secretary, Hassan Yabo, the group said the executive, legislature and judiciary must continue to lead the way in fighting corruption by prosecuting dishonest politicians and civil servants with a view to sustaining economic growth. The said politicians involved in the arms deal scandal during the previous government must be brought to justice and appealed to the Federal Government, security agencies and the judiciary to “withdraw and rescind the bails they secured.” According to the group, “The time has come for the truth to be exposed; sides of decency should be taken, corrupt contractors and those who aided and abetted them must be jailed.” The statement said those involved in the arms deal including former governors are still moving about freely and “swim in money with their families.” white paper on insecurity : Report Links Boko Haram With London Scholar Anger at judiciary worries me  – CJN Mahmud Judgement-fixing claims that won’t go away Dear Esteemed reader, As part of our drive to keep improving the content of our newspaper, we are conducting a readership survey to enable us serve you better.
