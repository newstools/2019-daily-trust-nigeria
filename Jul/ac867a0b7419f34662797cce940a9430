The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) has raised alarm over a possible massive retrenchment of workers in the steel sector as non-patronage of local steel products spell doom for the steel industry. The Basic Metal, Iron and Steel and Fabricated Metal Products Sectoral Group of MAN raised the alarm  at the annual general meeting of the Group, yesterday in Lagos The immediate past Chairman of the Group, Chief Oluyinka Kufile, said in the past two years that the construction industry which were heavily involved in some infrastructure projects, had refused to engage some of its members. Kufile said: “this has stagnated operations in most of our  members’ businesses across the industry. the sector may have no choice if the situation persists,  but to consider the option of closure to save our  investments from further losses. We are hoping that government will quickly address these issues, otherwise, unemployment along with poverty will worsen as the level of hunger, social and economic deprivation and insecurity could be the other of the day.” Meanwhile, a director at the Federal Ministry of Mines and Steel, Ime Ekrikpo, said plans were underway by the present administration to take up the per capita consumption of steel products from the current less than 10kg to about a 100kg by 2020.
