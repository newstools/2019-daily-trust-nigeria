Nine out of 13 local governments in Nasarawa State cannot pay salaries due to shortfall in revenues, the State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, has said. He made the statement in Maraba-Gongon in Wamba Local Government Area, at the commissioning of Sustainable Development Goals, (SDG) for an upgrade of 50-year-old Maraba- Gongon primary school. “Nine out of the 13 local governments cannot pay salaries on time due to financial instability and revenue shortfall; that is why I am apologising over the delay in the payment of June salaries,” he said. He added, ‘‘when local government chairmen seek permission to use money allocated for capital projects to pay salaries, I don’t permit them as I don’t touch their money. They shouldn’t break the law’’. Governor Sule said he is among the first set of governors to support local government autonomy.
