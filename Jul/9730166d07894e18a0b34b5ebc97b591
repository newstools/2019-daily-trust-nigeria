On July 9, the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council adopted a formal recommendation to nominate Lagarde as president of the European Central Bank. Lagarde’s nomination will now be discussed by the ECB governing council and the European Parliament, and the final appointment by European Council in October. In the beginning of July, Lagarde in a statement said she would relinquish her role as head of the IMF during the nomination process to be president of the European Central Bank.
