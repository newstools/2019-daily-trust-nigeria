The PDP Governors’ Forum has advised the National Assembly to eschew impunity and abide by court orders. The forum specifically asked the federal lawmakers to abide by a high court order restricting the National Assembly from interfering in the leadership crisis in the Bauchi State House of Assembly. Two speakers (Abubakar Suleiman and Kawuwa Shehu-Damina) emerged at the inauguration of the 9th Bauchi Assembly through parallel elections; prompting a 12-member House of Representatives Committee headed by Musa Sarkin Adar to be constituted with the mandate to find out the circumstances surrounding the development. However, an interim injunction dated July 22, granted by Judge Muazu Abubakar, said the parties involved in the crisis should halt all proceedings until October 3, when the court sits to hear the motion filed by the applicant. The PDP Governors’ Forum in a statement, yesterday, by its chairman and governor of Bayelsa State, Seriake Dickson, also called on the National Assembly to “walk back the culture of impunity and lawlessness that is hardening its bite on the polity” and show more respect for the rights of the citizens. “Acting otherwise or delaying in respecting the order would represent a direct and serious affront to the rule of law in a democratic government and a dangerous abuse of power; which Nigerians would see as steadily emboldening a climate of impunity in governance, and strengthening the hands of those who unleash brutal force against democracy. However, impunity will not ‘change’ Nigeria for the better,” he said.
