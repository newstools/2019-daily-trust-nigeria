The authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have given Nigeria August 6, 2019 deadline for the temporary stoppage of pilgrims’ visitation to Madinah, the city of Prophet Muhammad. As a result of this, the Nigerian pilgrims who fail to arrive Madinah before the deadline will have to delay their visit to the city that hosts the second holiest mosque, Masjid Nabawiyy, till after Arafah.
