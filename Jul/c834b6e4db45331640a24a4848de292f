Lagos state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has declared that both Lekki – Epe Toll Plaza at Admiralty and the Lekki – Ikoyi Link Bridge will on Thursday, July 11, be run free during traffic hours between 6:30 and 9:30 in the morning as well as between 4:30pm and 8:00pm in the evening, so as to conduct a traffic survey within the area. The governor disclosed this at a briefing with journalists after the tour of the area on Wednesday.
