The Jigawa State chapter of Social Democratic Party (SDP) has instituted a court case against Jigawa State Independent Electoral Commission (JISIEC), challenging the power of the commission to impose fee on candidates in contrast to the 1999 constitution. The chairman of the party, Abba Anas, made this known yesterday while addressing journalists in Dutse. Anas said his party headed to court to challenge the reason that informed the decision of the commission to impose fee for the purchase of form by any candidate willing to contest for elective position during the just concluded council election.

He, therefore, wondered why JISIEC should impose a fee of N500,000 and N200,000 for chairmanship and councillorship candidates. The former lawmaker said the SDPâ€™s prayer before the court was to nullify the councils election held on June 29 in the state for contravening the constitution. Sixteen political parties with the exception of SDP and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) participated in the election.
