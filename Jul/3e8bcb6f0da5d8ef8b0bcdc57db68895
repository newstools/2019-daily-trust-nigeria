The former Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly Matters (House of Reps), Suleiman Abdulrahman Kawu Sumaila, has said that President Muhammadu Buhari has made the right choice in nominating Alhaji Sabo Nanono and Major General Bashir Magashi (rtd) as ministers from Kano State. Kawu, a former two-term Deputy Minority Leader of the House, said the two nominees from Kano State were not only qualified for the positions but that they also enjoyed the massive support of the Kano people to represent them at the federal cabinet. Kawu said with their nominations, President Buhari had demonstrated courage and showed that he was ready to give Nigerians the best in terms of governance during his second term in office. “I must commend the President for this uncommon courage. He has shown that he is once again ready for business so that Nigerians will get the best,” Kawu said. “I know Alhaji Nanono has been a very good progressive and grassroots politician of many years standing. He has been with the president since 2003 during the first contest of President Muhammadu Buhari. “As for General Magashi, nobody can dispute the fact that he has been one of those that have stood by President Muhammadu Buhari through thick and thin. Like Nanono, Magashi is also a dogged and committed grassroots politician,” he added.
