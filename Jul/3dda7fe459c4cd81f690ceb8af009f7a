The Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Ayuba Gora Wobin, has cautioned tricycle operators, popularly called keke against reckless riding. The sector commander who spoke with our reporter in his office yesterday said the command has embarked on the sensitization of the keke operators in the FCT to ensure they complied with traffic rules and regulations. He said most of the keke riders transited from being motorcycle riders and the attitude is still the same. “The keke riders were motorcycle riders before they bought keke and started plying the roads. So the transition is not easy. We have been educating them and saying you cannot ride keke like you rode motorcycles,” he said. Wobin said when he assumed office in the FCT in 2017, his major concern was how to educate the riders on how to obey traffic rules by not beating traffic light and not riding against traffic.
