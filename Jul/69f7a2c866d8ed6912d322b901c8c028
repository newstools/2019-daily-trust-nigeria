Leader of the APC in Bayelsa State and a former governor, Chief Timipre Sylva, has urged the youth to stand with him to return as governor come February 2020. Sylva, who governed Bayelsa State from 2007 to 2012, said during his 55th birthday celebration, yesterday, in Yenagoa, that he was coming to prepare ground for the young people to take over the realm of leadership in the state since he will serve for only one term. He said, “I always tell you young people that the future belongs to you, me, if I become governor again, I will be governor for four years after that they will still call me former governor. I am already a former governor. So, there’s nothing new for me to achieve. And by the time I finish as governor, I will almost be 60. So, retirement is near.
