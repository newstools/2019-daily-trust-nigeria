So, we can even make good use of the aquatic environment where you have the fishes all around. “When you talk about security, when someone is engaged, it will be difficult for him to leave his work and go to create problem for another person. “So, first, we must look at the basis of insecurity, see where the lousy minds are emanating from. “In that regard, we have what we call Productive Enterprise Training Centres (PENTRAC) with which we will engage young minds into skill acquisitions” he said.
