Danladi and the APC had approached the tribunal to challenge the victory of Governor Darius Ishaku of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).

The petitioners further claimed that Ishaku’s election was invalid on the grounds of alleged corrupt practices. However, in a ruling yesterday, the chairman of the tribunal, Justice M.O. Adewarahe said the petition was dismissed because of the July 5 judgment of the Supreme Court, which upheld the Appeal Court judgment that disqualified Danladi on the grounds of false declaration of age.
