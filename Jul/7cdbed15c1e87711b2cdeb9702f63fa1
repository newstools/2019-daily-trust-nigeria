The youth leaders cautioned against excessive use of the legislative ascendancy to address personal concerns and dealings by lawmakers and other public officers. “The abusive use of public office must be addressed with this issue to set the tone right for others.” “Those entrusted with public offices should always remember that they were elected or appointed there to serve and not to use the power to intimidate us,” it added. The group urged public officers to always comport themselves. The Senate, on Wednesday, set up a bi-partisan ad hoc committee, headed by Sen. Sam Egwu, to probe the alleged assault on the nursing mother by Abbo. (NAN) Nigerian celebrities call for Sen Elisha Abbo's arrest Reps condemn alleged assault of woman by Sen.
