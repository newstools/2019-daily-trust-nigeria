We have always known that the rot is unimaginable. But it is important that I see things for myself. “I have seen things for myself and I have asked the chief judge (and his team) to raise a memo, stating what the problems are and what we can do to solve them in short and long terms,” he said. Gov. AbdulRazaq said he would ensure that the judiciary was given the support it needed to function as an independent arm of government. The Chief Judge of the state, Justice Suleiman Kawu, told the governor he had long prepared a report detailing the problems faced in the sector, especially the decrepit state of the facilities and lack of modern courtrooms.
