The Supreme Court yesterday dismissed the appeal by Senator Ademola Adeleke challenging the declaration of GboyegaOyetola as winner of the Osun State governorship election. In the lead judgement by Justice Bode Rhodes-Vivour, the apex court declared that the absence of the judge who read the majority judgment of the election tribunal, Justice Peter Obiorah, on the proceeding of February 6 rendered the entire proceedings a nullity. The judge upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal that under Section 285(4) of the Constitution, composition of court is fundamental to a trial and borders on fair hearing, adding that the proper thing to have been done in the absence of Justice Peter Obiorah was to start the entire trial afresh.

However, two justices dissented from the majority decision and upheld Adeleke as winner. Justices Kumai Akaahs and AdamuGalinje held that Senator Adeleke scored the majority votes and fulfilled the constitutional requirement to be declared winner. The apex court also dismissed the cross appeal by the PDP challenging some aspects of the decision of the Osun State Election Petitions Tribunal which upheld the election of the party candidate, Senator Ademola Adeleke. The PDP had in the cross appeal contended that the appellate court erred when it dismissed its cross appeal challenging the improper ballot counting which cost it 3, 402 and 379 votes in 23 polling units. But in the lead judgment by Justice Uwani Abba-Aji, the apex court held that the PDP appeal lacks foundation since the lead appeal by its candidate has been dismissed on the basis of improper composition.
