The Association of Power Generation Companies (APGC) has called on the federal government to address power problems so Nigeria can boost electricity generation and reap gains from the signing of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA). All heads of government of the African Union signed the pact recently in Niamey, Niger Republic. The Executive Secretary of APGC, Dr. Joy Ogaji in a statement on Wednesday said the Generation Companies (GenCos) are confident the AfCFTA could raise intra-Africa trade from the current 16 per cent to about 60 per cent. As the biggest economy in Africa, with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of about $400 billion, Ogaji said the new agreement clearly presents Nigeria the potential opportunity to play a more active role in the regional and global economy.

Given the critical role adequate power supply plays in national development and enabling trade, she said government has a responsibility to pay particular attention to it as the benefits of the AfCFTA agreement to Nigeria may not be fully realised until the problems of the power sector are fully addressed.
