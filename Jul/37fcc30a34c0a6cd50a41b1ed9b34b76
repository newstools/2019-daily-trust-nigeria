The National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking In Persons (NAPTIP) and other related matters in Benue State has rescued 86 victims in 2018 alone. NAPTIP’s Commander of the Makurdi zonal command, comprising of five states, Aganran Ganiu Alao, disclosed this in an interview with our correspondent in Makurdi shortly after the agency’s road walk to mark this year’s “War Against Human Trafficking”. Alao noted that the command, since its formation in the state in 2013, had secured a total of 20 convictions of traffickers, adding that eight of the convictions were secured in 2018. He said that 58 other cases were currently being investigated by the Investigation and Monitoring department of the command while 16 cases are in court at the moment. He added that, in line with this year’s theme, “Human Trafficking, Get Government Action,” the command, under his watch, embarked on a road walk from the Benue State University gate to Wurukum junction in Makurdi to sensitise the public and create awareness about the activities of human traffickers. Alao decried the endemic status of trafficking of persons in Benue State, stressing that the menace was worst in three local government areas of Oju, Konshisha and Vandekiya local government areas of the state.
