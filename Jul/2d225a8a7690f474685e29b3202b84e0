The Board of Trustees (BoT) of the PDP however, said yesterday that it was on the same page with the NWC on the list of the party’s nomination for minority positions in the House of Representatives. The BoT Chairman, Senator Walid Jibrin had at his residence in Abuja Wednesday endorsed Rep. Ndudi Elumelu as Minority Leader, when he (Elumelu) paid him a visit, after the NWC had already sent its list of nominees to the Speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila. Addressing a press conference in Abuja, Senator Jibrin said the board would continue to work with the NWC and other organs of the party to ensure the party succeeded. “As a result of the fracas in the House of Representatives during the selection of the  minority leader, the BoT and  the NWC have decided to intervene immediately with the NWC forwarding the party’s list to the speaker for urgent implementation,” he said.
