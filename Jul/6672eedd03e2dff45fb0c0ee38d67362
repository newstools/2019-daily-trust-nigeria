A truck laden with a container ran, on late Sunday evening, into a crowd of commuters and a commercial motorcycle operator at the Agboju bus stop on the Mile2-Badagry expressway, killing four persons and injuring many others. The truck was believed to have had a brake failure. A senior police officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said, “Yes, a truck conveying a container ran into some passengers at Agboju bus stop and killed four persons. Many people were injured too. About six persons have been rushed to the hospital. We are trying to evacuate the bodies of four persons crushed by the container.

The driver has been arrested and he is in the protective custody of the police.” A resident in the area, John Udor, however, blamed the bad road and negligence of government agencies for the tragedy, “The government should expedite action on road repairs. The roads are in a terrible state,” Udor said. The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Deputy Superintendent of Police Bala Elkana, said he was yet to be briefed by the Agboju DPO.
